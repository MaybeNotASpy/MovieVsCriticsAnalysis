Apr 2 2024,negative,this was by bar none no exceptions the worst movie ive ever seen what ever you do do not waste any part of your time in life on this movie its bad enough that your wasting time reading this why the critics rated this movie at 86 is far beyond any kind of comprehension
Mar 26 2024,positive,spoilers extremely popular and influential found footage movie from the 90s about three film students mike josh and heather who embark on a journey roughing it in the maryland woods chasing the legend of the famed blair witch that has allegedly been haunting this woodland area for centuriesbut like the proverbial dog that caught the car the answers they find out their in the shady pines arent ones the expected or even want necessarilyand pretty soon it becomes clear that all three kids are swallowed up by the very same evil forces in this enchanted forrest that theyve been investigating      this is not a great movie but theres an effective mood that is sustained throughout and some powerful moments including the now iconic ending    overall thumbs up 
Mar 23 2024,negative,why is this caclled the blair witch project when theres no witch at all    this is really boring for the first ever found footage movie this was a bad impression and this is the cruse of the found footage movies
Mar 12 2024,positive,fear is not found in what is known but is hiding in the unknown three film students attempt to discover the existence of the elusive blair witch in the woods only to find themselves lost and stalked by an unseen entity that watches from the trees playing on paranoia and desperation this foundfootage film manages to make that horror trope a household name
Feb 16 2024,negative,a clear example of the viral phenomenon way before the existance of social networks the most succesful movie ever financially speaking its what these unknown people even to this day achieved a minimal budget a story that doesnt tell us anything sold as a possible true footage story at that time
Feb 11 2024,positive,the blair witch project is an effective movie because the more i think about it the scarier it becomes this is a notorious movie that is lowbudget and a groundbreaking pioneer for the found footage genre i think the found footage element works here and makes the story feel very real the movie is terrifying because of what you cant see and it made my imagination run wild with scary theories i think it is a movie that ends abruptly but after watching some videos online it starts to make sense that this is part of how the film doesnt want anyone to truly understand what is happening overall it is an innovative horror film that does so much with the absolute bare minimum and it should be an inspiration to any aspiring filmmakers in the world
Feb 5 2024,positive,personally this sort of fear works best for me i scare easily but this movie proved to me that i am most scared of what i imagine not what i see
Jan 31 2024,positive,an absolute low budget masterpiece of a film it has subtle yet realistic scares the scariest part is that it also makes you feel like your their but also the ending the interviews also set the stage on what we should expect yet it still makes me feel like i have no idea what is going to happen next
Jan 27 2024,positive,i can see how some people like the movie it always keeps the tension up and just keeps you guessing whats happening for me it was sadly boring but it may not be for others
Jan 16 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ever  lots of film footage of running through the woods that must have been shot by high school level film students the only thing good about this film was the marketing
Dec 28 2023,positive,its for great vibes and the acting is great but its never really scary
Dec 4 2023,positive,i just rewatched this movie again for the first time since 1999  i loved it back then when found footage movies were unheard of and enjoyed it just as much now  i always appreciate a movie that honors the notion of realistic human behavior
Nov 25 2023,positive,legendary movie only 5 and half stars because it takes a long time to get to the good stuff
Nov 16 2023,positive,even though you dont get any jump scares pr stuff the pure terror lives up to everything must see
Nov 10 2023,positive,oddly what makes so many people hate the blair witch project the lack of any reveal and the constant frayedraw emotions from the cast are what i find to be its strongest assets a nightmarish odyssey that only disturbs me more as i think about it
Nov 5 2023,positive,i found this film mesmerising and also very moving i felt so sorry for the people involved i know its meant to be scary and it really is very scary but also its sad the characters are all likeable or they become more likeable in my opinion and the whole film is exceptional i am not at all into film making or films or even tele but this film really astounded me i feel it represents the most beautiful example of film making ive ever seen it is just brilliant the lack of special effects is heavenly and it reminded me of lord of the flies in a way but didnt because the people involved didnt do what they couldve done they continued to care for each other and treat each other as equals even when it was very difficult to do so that is a very mild version  i dont want to say any more in case anyone hasnt seen the film its genuinely frightening and leaves a lot to the imagination which is an essential quality in any frightening film its fantastic
Oct 29 2023,positive,horrifically filmed like a documentary the blair witch project is a take on horror that we need more often it doesnt need to show whats so scary that they are looking at to have you as chilled to the bone
Oct 24 2023,positive,the scariest movie of all time is a true story    the blair witch project is a 1999 american supernatural horror film written directed and edited by daniel myrick and eduardo s√°nchez      its good   id recommend it if you like this genre     a unique and interesting concept which helps to create the mystery and build the suspense    in october of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentary a year later their footage was found
Oct 24 2023,negative,took me over 20 years to finally watch it and i wish i didnt turns out i knew a steaming pile of sht when i was 15 and it came out and i shouldve trusted myself as terrible as it looks on the tv screen in low resolution 480i of a camcorder i cant even begin to imagine how god awful it mustve looked on a 50 foot movie screen for those who watched it in theaters totally overrated and the obvious solution to getting lost and turned around over and over was not to change directions from south to walking east all day the solution was to follow the damn stream until you got back to civilization morons streams lead to rivers rivers lead to towns of course lots of streams also lead to towns these morons couldnt find their way home if they had an iphone 15 and garmin handset for backup if it was real the earth is better off without the likes of their stupidity
Oct 23 2023,negative,it was awful absolutly boring i am a huge horror fan and understand that the found footage was new i dont hate found footage it can be made well i can also appreciate long time for good endings but this was not worth it people fighting over a map in a wooded area with trucks clearly seen on a highway nearby lol and scary twigs wow so scary the ending was not worth it or scary i finished it and thought why do people like it
Oct 23 2023,negative,entire film consists of 3 adults arguing about the same thing over and over again not one moment was i scared spooked interested or anything of the sort the film only consisted of me only feeling annoyance and boredom i yelled thats it at the tv once it ended i couldnt believe that was the ending i went in with zero expectations and was still disappointed the scary part of the movie is hearing a very faint yelling in the background and seeing bundles of sticks and piles of rocks that have suddenly appeared overnight this isnt a kept the monster hidden for mystery this is a lets film some trees for two hours and expect people to be scared because we had the actors pretend to be scared
Oct 22 2023,negative,i didnt like it it scared me
Oct 21 2023,positive,very creative groundbreaking in its time
Oct 20 2023,positive,not for everybody but for those who appreciates off screen horror
Oct 14 2023,positive,incredibly effective influential foundfootage that really makes the most of its budget the atmosphere makes the short runtime feel like it stretches into days lost in the forest every emotional outburst feels completely earned as you start to hate each character as much as they hate each other solid classic minimalist horror that is probably unmatched in its genre to this day
Oct 10 2023,positive,i missed this part of the horror realm growing up never thought about and then i watched it i was pleasantly surprised the characters are great with a dark atmosphere its written in the tone of a 60s monster film but has a new bourne style and this really works the shaky cam phase this brought about i could have done without but this is a pretty good film
Oct 10 2023,positive,i see how this made an impact but not how people actually thought it was real    its very well made and the acting was technically great but the payoff was so disappointingi get that it was going for not seeing it will make it scarierbut man we didnt see a thing i admittedly dont know what kind of reveal i wouldve found satisfyingbut i wanted something more than clanking noisesunwanted presents outside the tent in the morning unknown scream and mike in a corner thats all you get across the whole movie    this is honestly a pretty boring and unsatisfying watch but it was very creative at the time and it left a big markso its worth seeing once
Oct 2 2023,positive,the one that started all the one that makes the big studios realize that with less budget more profit if they put a little bit of imagination    the movie stresses enough but you got to go with the flow you have to put yourself in that situation something that is a little hard with the shakiness of the camera
Sep 20 2023,positive,i just watched this movie for the first time in september 2023 it was still pretty good  i imagine it would have had a lot more of an impact on me when it came out in 1999 i remember my brother went to the movie theater to watch it  said he got nauseous from motion sickness due to the shaky cam i think thats probably why i avoided it for so long my wife convinced me to give it a shot since were in the halloween season now im glad i watched it  i understand why the movie blew up the way that it did the acting was convincing sans maybe some of the moments where they refused to put down the camera or stop recording that all being said it wasnt scary in the least bit to me
Sep 15 2023,positive,the blair witch project came out in 1999 when i was still at school there was a lot of buzz surrounding the movie back in the day i think its a great film that leaves a lot to your own imagination check it out
Sep 5 2023,negative,im certain i thought this was doody when i saw it
Aug 22 2023,negative,overrated junk  i remember being excited to see this movie when a friend raved about it and critics were crowing about it too  just because it was made by amateurs in cinema verit√© style doesnt make it great  i found it boring uninvolving uninteresting and definitely not scary  wow what a waste of time and money  i really dont understand the heaps of praise for this movie  this should have been sent to trash bin instead of theatres
Aug 22 2023,negative,do not take the bait on this one  it was not good in the theater  it was not good on tv  however for some reason you will want to watch this a second time and i dont mean that in a good way its almost like you wont believe you just watched it  or like maybe you missed something its one of those movies that prospered because of word of mouth in the early internet days  like when a website today tells you about the scariest movies ever and then you end up watching something like terrifier 2      it is somewhat suspenseful and it got away from the slasher genre enough  however it does not seem like the actors even have their lines rehearsed  but my biggest complaints are the shaky as can be camera work  the fact that it is not scary at all at any point and how nothing actually happens
Aug 18 2023,positive,terrifying creepy and effective and smart scary movie
Aug 6 2023,positive,i have tried very hard to appreciate this film ive watched it alone in the dark and with no interruptions ive strained my brain trying to make sense of its non sequiturs through the distracting found footage ie awful camerawork   ultimately though 90 of it consists of obnoxious college kids getting lost in a very unthreatening wood i see some commentators have made up a few things to try and join it all together but the plot is just absent
Aug 5 2023,positive,not as exciting now but better when you consider when it was made and how it inspired future horror
Aug 4 2023,negative,i get the idea of first person running but steady cam as a third person perspective at some point would have been nice if it got there i wouldnt know as it was too jarring and disorienting to keep watching it
Jul 30 2023,negative,why no rhythm and no horror just a lot of panting in the dark the spook maybe a witch who abducted a girl although maybe also a hermit guy who killed seven children apparently spends its time making little joseph beuystype sculptures from local rocks and twigs to drive everyone into hysteria and insanity and incredibly enough thats the movie improvised from a 35page script
Jul 15 2023,positive,one might call the ending disappointing but to me it captures the aesthetic perfectly  a mustwatch
Jul 13 2023,positive,you have to be in the right mood for this one but it still totally holds up if you have an overactive imagination it can still be pretty terrifying the whole thing feels quite authentic 
Jul 9 2023,positive,stull remember the first time i saw this great movie the day when it came out love found footage movies when brought well
Jul 8 2023,positive,the movie starts off a little slow but when the movie picks up it is absolutely terrifying the acting is top notch and the setting is chilling especially at night
Jul 7 2023,positive,an amazing idea but i think it would work better if it was a short film still interesting nonetheless
Jul 4 2023,positive,it treats the drama well and is very maddening in this case it is a good thing but some situations are very stupid but the horror environment is quite chilling it is original for its time but it is not crazy
Jul 1 2023,negative,it sucked fav part was when i went america raaaaaah whenever they mentioned america
Jun 30 2023,positive,i was pleasantly surprised found footage is really hit or miss for me i hate paranormal activity im sure it was better in theaters but i streamed it and it sucked imo and was very underwhelmed by rec and hellhouse llc lake mungo the poughkeepsie tapes and as above so below are okay though and i love the taking of deborah logan and the visit     what makes this better than paranormal activity is the acting the characters are actually believable though not necessarily likeable also getting lost in the woods is already a scary situation on its own even without any supernatural elements     i was really expecting this movie to be boring as hell and it wasnt bad at all quite tense
Jun 17 2023,positive,one of my favourite horrors of all times great story perfectly executed
May 25 2023,negative,saw this when it first came out and it was horrible
May 22 2023,positive,honestly it was kind of a let down since i was a kid i heard of the blair witch project and how scary this real found footage was such a scary and a classic horror movie also no way was this a bad movie and it is defiantly not boring it was just a let down and the ending did not fully satisfy me but really i guess it is found footage so it would not have a hollywood ending
May 3 2023,negative,its the emperors new clothes its massively overrated its absolute style over substance its bare faced cheek its awful avoid the hype at all costs
Apr 21 2023,negative,as a horror film of the late 90s and the first film to popularize the found footage genre this film would have been very good when it came out in 2023 however its boring and not scary at all this is the first time ive seen the film but thanks to the pop culture and parodies of this film i basically knew most of what happens the acting from the 3 leads is good but the characters are annoying aholes with the girl heather being the worst the plot is basic but good they could have done so much more with it but instead of scary witches we just get alot of annoying shouting and snotty crying if you havent seen this and somehow managed to avoid any spoilers then you may enjoy it and find it creepy otherwise if you already know how it ends dont waste your time
Apr 13 2023,neutral,far from the best found footage film not much for suspensehorror though just a couple kids lost in the woods
Apr 9 2023,positive,watched it again tonight it is absolutely terrifying incredible performances from the 3 main actors
Apr 9 2023,positive,one of the greatest horror movies ever made
Mar 31 2023,negative,should be commended for taking a camcorder and tricking people into thinking it was an actual movie so painfully awful
Feb 27 2023,positive,the movie is scary the actors did a great job thoroughly enjoyable
Feb 19 2023,negative,i am not even exaggerating when i say ive seen disney sitcom episodes scarier than this movie literally nothing happens its one of the laziestwritten movies ever
Feb 14 2023,positive,creepy but didnt have much payoff or resolution
Feb 13 2023,neutral,good found footage movie but its well past its time
Feb 10 2023,negative,great ending but the movie is literally like 85 people talking just watch the beginning the scene where they lost the map and one of the 3 characters gets taken away and the ending theres no reason to watch the entire movie
Jan 13 2023,negative,the acting was absolutely phenomenal ill give it that it was a smart movie considering the filming circumstances and budget however i was not scared in the least i spent the entire movie just waiting for it to get to the climax and just when it did  it cut off and the credits rolled leaving you with absolutely nothing i rarely find movies slow  this however was one of them its a shame because i had really high hopes for this movie  shame i didnt feel it lives up to its reputation
Jan 4 2023,positive,a new kind of horror movie that induces panic and fear through the eyes of the protagonists
Jan 1 2023,positive,im trying to think why some people disliked this movie the few who didnt like it seem to report that its boring id like to see the movies that they think are exciting to each his own some people felt that nothing happened in this movie it depends on what the viewer expected to see happening in the movie if you think that for a movie to be horrifying it should show peoples internal organs ripped out  by someone only for a horrifying effect i personally find those kind of movies to be   dull
Nov 25 2022,positive,the best acting performance from heather donahue
Nov 8 2022,positive,filled with a distinctly creepy atmosphere and incredible performances the groundbreaking blair witch project uses its foundfootage concept to mostly great effect with a dramatic suspenseful and realistic touch all leading up to a disappointing ending
Nov 5 2022,negative,neat idea but honestly pretty boring 
Nov 5 2022,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen i can do a better job even with my iphone 4 dont waste your time stupid movie l
Nov 1 2022,positive,very intriguing well made low budget classic
Oct 31 2022,positive,the most terrifying movie ive ever seen especially if you live near the woods lol no but honestly epic
Oct 31 2022,neutral,the perfect way to do a found footage movie leaves enough breathing space between the scares and just enough intruige to make the viewer wonder whats happening next
Oct 27 2022,positive,not gonna lie this really disappointed me this film is not bad by any means but it is not like a cult classic either for years i have been told that this film is the best horror film ever and it is the scariest movie of all time and it is outstanding this was kinda just an ok movie the film is kinda just like watching 3 people argue in the woods this movie however felt slow paced even though its only 80 minutes long i have to give the film credit for trying something new not many movies do that nowadays the found footage sub genre would not be the same today without this movie some of my favorite horror movies ever come from this movie such as rec the acting in this movie is amazing especially for smaller actors at the time its just arguing but the last 20 minutes of this movie still gives me nightmares to this day and i will never forget it it almost makes up for the rest of the movie but not entirely the blair witch project sound design is horrifying just the sound of being lost in the woods and the crunching of twigs and no music makes it feel like you are in this movie this movie overall is just ok and a fun movie to rewatch on halloween i still think you should see this movie because it is a good time it is slow but trust me the movies last 20 minutes is so good effective scary and dark that is worth watching the movie its ok and helps pass the time
Oct 22 2022,positive,the viewer reviews are pretty half brained its a 60000 dollar movie made by two people to be simulated as a found footage documentary its a slow burn like most good movies should be if someone cant handle that and neither remember how the movie was developed then its simply not for them watch this movie this alone is the movie that pioneered the wave of the found footage genre and should be loved
Oct 16 2022,negative,the unforgivable pacing of the blair witch project will lose you in moments nothing really scares comes of this until maybe the very end until then though be ready to endure 110 minutes of bickering whining and wandering
Oct 14 2022,positive,boring overrated but 2 classic shots borderline between skip and worth one watch lean more toward skip
Oct 13 2022,negative,what a waste of almost 2 hours just awful you dont see anything really happen just a lot of annoying screaming and bad film making
Oct 11 2022,positive,a classic movie that started the foundfootage subgenre this movie was so creepy the fact that you only see what the camera sees is so unsettling this movie was in my head for weeks
Oct 7 2022,negative,i remember going to see this on opening night in a fully packed theater and being disappointed and kinda angry i remember the audience reacting the same way thats it what the hell things like this could be heard as people stormed out of the theater as the credits rolled i remember being so pumped to watch this and it sucked so bad its really slow not scary and basically is 3 people running through the woods with a shaky camera being scared at nothing and then you get let down at the end when you never get to see the blair witch
Sep 16 2022,positive,an incredible horror movie that still scares me today a cinema horror timeless pillar
Sep 16 2022,negative,script  three young adults spent their lives indoors never went outside enough as kids    the end
Sep 14 2022,positive,this is an amazing movie for older kids and teens the suspense and gore is killer
Sep 6 2022,positive,anyone who says it isnt scary  go and camp out in the woods the night after watching it and tell me again    this film was released in a time when films could be scary without showing you what was supposed to be scary you make up your own mind a great film made on a meagre budget and with imagination at its core rather than special effects and sceneenhancing score
Aug 28 2022,positive,still the only thing i think about when im scared at night even a month later 45 stars because 5 stars for scary 1 star for my sanity
Aug 27 2022,positive,dont watch it if you live in a house in the middle of the woods like me  but its not bad and its not good
Aug 9 2022,positive,amazing original and a new element to the horrror genre to give it a chilling revive
Aug 4 2022,positive,all these years later and it was still soooo good not sure what users are thinking even back in first release we all loved it and i assumed it was at least 70 rating 
Jul 30 2022,positive,this is what horror movies are supposed to do no need for jumpscares no need for a demonic character to appear just a horrifying atmosphere and disturbing occurrences i have never watched a horror movie and felt the way i did in that last scene absolutely unsettling and terrifying
Jul 5 2022,positive,while the blair witch project isnt the first found footage film its certainly the first to be met with both widespread box office success and critical acclaim  its the story of three documentary filmmakers who trek off into the woods of maryland to investigate the blair witch a local legend from decades earlier thought to be responsible for the grisly deaths of local children and hunters  is it jump out of your seat scary  no  is it the kind of movie to get under your skin sure to trigger a horrible reaction should you find yourself alone in the woods at night oh yeah the whole thing feels genuine from the solid performances from the three unknown lead actors to the convincing handheld camerawork to the perfect pacing  the blair witch project is the definition of creepy
Jun 13 2022,negative,sooooooo disappointing the campers heather mike and josh get background info on the blair witch from locals head into the woods and get lost typical stuff and tension builds up nicely although it is dragged out a bit long josh randomly goes missing and eventually heather and mike find a cabin that was referred to by the locals at the start of the film so its like oooh shits finally gonna hit the fan and then nothing all this longwinded tension that was built up amounted to nothing the anticipated moment never came we never saw any action like at all all we get is some screams heard from josh and as mike and heather explore the cabin we just see their cameras get suddenly dropped to the floor and thats it we dont know if or how they are killed or if anyone escapes or even confirmation if this blair witch as actually real its clearly implied the witch is real but all we see is cameras dropping to the floor and are not shown what takes place just a super anticlimactic ending
May 26 2022,negative,most overrated horror movie of all time so much hype pretty pathetic that a fake obituary was put in newspaper delighted when found out they had to retrace statement just plain awful not in the least bit scary wow those scary stick formations sooo scary not main character over sensationalized no real depth so lame bad acting all actors were bad this movie was rated as groundbreaking and that it was responsible for spawn of reality tv shows then its a movie that never should have happened no such thing as reality shows theyre heavily scripted only difference is worst acting possible i wish i could give this movie a zero star oh and ending was so disappointing i watched it with my horror movie friend we looked at each other like this is what all that hype was about i wasted that time of watching this movie and ill never get it back theres new blair witch project movies i wont get tricked again oh another edit someone pleeeze give that poor girl a kleenex so nasty to watch snot run down her face for 127 minutes only good thing about it was it distracted from travesty of such a horrorable movie
May 19 2022,positive,filled with a distinctly creepy atmosphere and incredible performances the groundbreaking blair witch project uses its foundfootage concept to mostly great effect with a dramatic suspenseful and realistic touch all leading up to a disappointing ending
May 10 2022,negative,the movie as a whole along with the over acting was painfully bad which made it hard to watch
Apr 28 2022,positive,one of the greatest if not best found footage films the film is greatly directed and manages to create so much tension and suspense without showing the antagonist a single time
Apr 26 2022,positive,without a doubt the scariest horror film ive ever seen psychology at its best
Apr 26 2022,positive,this is actual horror it depicts the human mind and how it can swirl downwards i love movies like this the raw footage gives you the tone and mood of most of it being reality itself survival psychological and paranormal horror are the best combo you could put together truly a masterpiece the creators have talent
Apr 17 2022,neutral,obviously and deliberately bad stylistically it is meant to look amateurish it is so bad it is not even amateurish still it kept the mood through the bad style but not as well as quarantine 2008 the sounds were actually quite haunting the music was barely noticeable and excellent because of that it is actually quite haunting even though nothing happens it is a perfect length
Apr 5 2022,positive,5 stars for a movie that was meant to have frightened the life out of people who saw it in cinemas but best laugh ive had in a long time it was just so unrealistic and still dont know what was after them
Apr 3 2022,positive,this movie still holds up and has such great atmosphere the only thing that keeps it from a five is how annoying josh is but the ending and the whole movie is a instant classic
Feb 22 2022,negative,so this is what all the fuss was about yawn
Feb 20 2022,positive,definitely one of the best found footage films of all time decently scary good story and believable
Feb 7 2022,negative,wasnt even entertaining my entire family hates this movie and there are reasons
Jan 10 2022,positive,one of the most uncomfortable and terrifying films that ive watched the blair witch project stands as being one of the most influential and revolutionary films in the entire industry and one of the best horror films produced to date the unique at the time style was done marvelously the acting was topnotch and the script is surprisingly realistic the story is suspenseful and the setting is extremely eerie however the film can get a bit boring at parts and it feels less of a horror movie at most parts and more of a suspenseful and unsettling drama still though i ended up loving this film and is definitely one that shockingly stands the test of time especially due to its very small budget
Dec 31 2021,positive,the best horror film to date no cheap jumpscares just pure psychological horror packaged in the most believable amazing filming style that brings it to life and the marketing was incredible it made the movie so much more believable and enhanced the sheer terror the night scenes bring
Nov 1 2021,negative,i can appreciate the movie for pioneering found footage films but i have to say that im truly surprised this is the movie that did it it was stupid boring lacked suspense and the ending was awful the movie ended as soon as the climax had just started to build and there easily couldve been another half hour to the movie if not more im glad i watched the movie just because its a classic but i do not recommend anyone wasting their time watching this movie or at least watching it expecting to be entertained
Oct 25 2021,negative,nothing happens in this film there are 2 minor scary scenes but thats it dont reccommend
Oct 16 2021,negative,this horror movie was alright heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard did a decent job in this movie the plot of the movie was dark insane and peculiar its a crazy story about three people who lose their minds from being lost in the woods and it gets crazier as the movie progresses if you havent seen this movie yet dont waste your time its not worth watching
Oct 5 2021,negative,the low camera quality really helps this movie but aside from how cheap it was made it doesnt offer too much i do love how we dont know if the entity is really there if our characters lost theyre minds the ending is probably the best part of the film and probably the most suspenseful if its halloween season id give it a watch i suppose aside from that there are better found footage horror films to watch
Sep 28 2021,positive,i remember watching this in cinema when it was initially released and leaving the theatre debating with my friends wait so was this all really found foutage part of the success of the film comes from an incredible marketing and pr campaign that made many spectators believe it was a real story and footage    but even past this pr stunt the film is great not gore or hardly but often really scary it proves that filmmaking doesnt have to mean huge budget to be successful
Aug 26 2021,negative,amateur boring seen it all before horror
Aug 25 2021,positive,even as a fan of the film i have to admit that it doesnt hold up after multiple viewings many who watch it these days for the first time wont realize how well the advertising had everyone convinced that this was an actual found footage movie being one of the first films to utilize the internet with a cool website touting the missing filmmakers as well as a cable special that felt like a documentary it fueled interest in the film and made it very intense i also admire that they did so much with very little money and production unfortunately with the curtain pulled and that we know its all a ruse the film dulls in intensity and just seems like a bad home video of three people wandering around in the woods saying the f word repeatedly bad sequels and reboots didnt help its legacy either still i remember leaving the theater very shook up and impressed so ill give it 4 stars
Aug 20 2021,positive,these unique gamechanging movies have always been something i have loved while i think they probably couldve done more with this film the unique form of presenting itself its amazing
Jul 22 2021,negative,overrated i dont know if it was the shaky camera or the bad story but i felt like vomiting halfway through the movie
Jul 9 2021,positive,the presentation is an interesting choice but 20 years later doesnt hold up the movies mercifully short because i dont know how much more shaky cam i could have taken the story makes sense unless you lose track of it because you cant hear the bad audio mix the characters are also kind of flat and somewhat unlikable i really dont have much else to say it was a creative presentation i found jarring and not that interesting its more like we got to see the footage shot within a movie about three people who went out to shoot a documentary about the blair witch while its significant that doesnt mean its necessarily good or great just a neat little movie that tried something different and marketed itself creatively too
Jul 5 2021,negative,i remember watching this movie in the theaters i remember walking out at the end wanting a refund i literally could have made the same movie with a video camera in the woods i cannot believe they actually made sequels too
Jun 27 2021,positive,a great film that laid the foundations of found footage films  though some found footage films can be questioned why the person keeps filming this explains it fairly cleanly while making sense the acting feels natural though personally i dont like the characters its not due to the acting but just the sort of people that the characters are  if you havent seen this yet it is worth your time
Jun 27 2021,negative,the blair witch project is the most overrated movie i may have ever watched rotten tomatoes gives less rating to so many good movies but cant understand how did they gave 80 rating to this movie were they paid    i have seen worse horrordrama movies but not like this one which is so much overhyped the film lacked proper direction story plot suspense acting spookyness etc it was just like lets record anything for 1 hour 20minutes and you have to just scream unnecessarily this movie had nothing good    dont know why people loved it and gave this movie cult status now people will say that i lack imagination and i didnt get the story i have seen many independent horrordrama movies and i love them because they had something in it    overall i dont want to torture anyone by recommending this movie not even my enemies
Jun 13 2021,negative,my partner told me this movie is really good bla bla bla waited one hour and it was not getting any better i write this so other people dont fall in the trap like i did if you dont like the first 10 minutes you will not like the rest so dont wait like i did take that movie out or play it from minute 45 on
Jun 5 2021,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would the first time i watched this i was a child and i was so unconvinced and annoyed at the screaming and fake crying that i had to stop watching it i asked my brother him not knowing i had even seen this movie what he thinks the absolute worst movie ever was and he said blair witch project i had the same movie in mind and that is proof that this is the worst movie in the entire world nothing could be worse if youre considering watching this movie please save yourself some time and burden because you will regret it and probably develop an awful headache
May 31 2021,negative,the first few people to see this film could possibly be forgiven for falling for the whole found footage thing but once this film started taking off and every magazine detailed how this really came about then there was simply nothing believable here and so no kind of tension at all    this is made in such a way that the second that you know its acted and not real then there just isnt any point in seeing this i dont know why i did
May 28 2021,negative,literally the biggest waste of time absolutely nothing happened the entire time they were just lost the whole time and nothing scary ever happened it never showed the witch and never explained anything boring boring boring
May 26 2021,positive,my alltime favorite horror movie made of simple ingredients you find yourself scared of something you never see perfect
May 23 2021,positive,a suspension filled low budget film with a short runtime gives enough scares and eerie feelings to keep anyone awake at night and afraid to enter the woods
May 22 2021,negative,boring no plot no deaths the only thing this movie focuses on is random noises in the middle of the woods
May 22 2021,positive,holy fucking shit talk about pioneering
May 10 2021,negative,a complete mess the plot was predictable the events were repetitive the characters were extremely idiotic and annoying the witch was never shown the camera quality was poor and shaky and the ending was pathetic however despite the appauling cringeworthy dialogue the acting was borderline acceptable and there were a few moments of tension hence the generous 1 star
May 4 2021,negative,found footage film that failed at the one job they had film the witch they did succeed at annoying the entire theater in 1999 though
May 3 2021,negative,not an intresting movie i actually fell asleep for the entire movie there is no story or intresting characters that can save this one
May 1 2021,negative,this is the depths of diabolical diarrhoea  its a badly filmed patch of grass with some screaming in the background after an hour of some kids wandering around with a tent  then it finishes
Apr 23 2021,negative,bored out of my mind  no budget was spent on any monster or evil that is ever shown on screen  just a trio of idiots arguing as they get lost in the woods  they couldnt even have the cheapest of scares the jump scare  everything scary is off camera and described or alluded to for the viewer
Apr 17 2021,positive,great at the movies ok at home remember when i first saw this at the movies and seeing the girls next to me coming out white a sheet but now old hat thanks to the many other found footage movies
Apr 16 2021,positive,it is effectively creepy and remains interesting despite basically just being a movie about people walking through the woods unfortunately part of the allure of the film was the idea that it might have actually occurred several decades later it is very clear that is not the case so it has lost some of what it made it so iconic and special upon its release
Apr 15 2021,positive,what makes this movie so compelling is the documentary take along side the slow crawl into madness watching this movie is refreshing as its not like other over saturated horror movies if you havent seen this one id give it a watch
Apr 2 2021,negative,over rated and more importantly over hyped this snot dribbling bore fest fails to takeoff where others in the same genre fly almost fell asleep in the cinema watching this it was so poor
Mar 30 2021,positive,a damn good found footage film that shaped horror movies for the next ten years the blair witch projects clever marketing unique style and ending combine to create one of the scariest movies to ever grace the silver screen
Mar 23 2021,negative,good performances but the camera work doesnt help to create tension its kind of a wannabe horror movie
Mar 8 2021,positive,the blair witch project has its moments but they are numbered and arent enough to make the film the moment however for its cleverness and influence it deserves some respect
Mar 4 2021,positive,if youre into indie movies this one is the right pick well it might not be the best movie ever but its certainly one of the pioneers of the fps genre there is enormous amount of tension throughout the film and it would be a shame not to take a look at it
Feb 26 2021,positive,the blair witch project left me impacted im absolutely speechless its something surreal its a sense of dread and fear with the protagonists its great
Feb 25 2021,positive,its still the best found footage movie ever
Feb 24 2021,negative,i feel asleep watching it
Feb 16 2021,positive,the blair witch project is one of the most divisive films of all time there are two groups of people when it comes to this movie those who love and call it the best horror film of all time and those who despise it and write it off as nothing more than a cheap thriller as you can see i am in the first category     the premise is simple the blair witch project is a found footage film about three teens who go into the forest of black hills maryland looking to create a documentary about a local legend about the blair witch as they get hopelessly lost and start hearing things in the dark they slowly begin to unravel this may seem like a generic horror film but to truly understand why this is such an amazing piece of work you need to know about the stuff going on behind the scenes     edward myrick and eduardo sanchez didnt want to make a horror movie they wanted to create something so real that people would actually believe this was recovered footage how did they go about this next to no script no special effects and no monster thats right you dont even see the blair witch all the scares are in your head the director literally gave the three actors cameras and some basic cues then dropped them in the middle of the woods the actors had only the slightest idea what was going on so their reactions seem real   because they are     the other big thing was the camerawork it is maddeningly amateur and thats the point three college filmmakers are not going to have access to imax cameras theyll be walking around with crappy handheld cams you cant see anything during the night scenes which makes the quiet cackling and snaps of branches in the distance infinitely more terrifying the entire movie is about what you cant see rather than a bunch of cgi jump scares     the other big tool they implemented was the marketing prior to the release of the film the crew set up missing posters of the three actors everywhere people saw this and watched the movie thinking it was real it took many people quite awhile to realize it was fake     however this is also the films greatest weakness twenty years later everyone knows this isnt a true story now so there isnt any intrigue surrounding it anymore people can either appreciate the movie for the great idea it had or think its boring this also makes the movie very hard to rewatch the whole horror aspect of the movie is that you cant see whats going on so you have no idea what will happen next thats rendered useless if youve already seen it before its really only good the first time you watch it and after that it is tedious and boring     whether you like this movie or not essentially comes down on your movie outlook if youre into physiological horror that teases scares instead of outright showing them to you youll love it if youd rather see the danger youll find this film terrifies and painful to sit through i would recommend this to anyone in the first category
Feb 15 2021,negative,this is the dumbest movie i understand it might have been scary in 1999 but the next person in 2021 who tells me its scary is going to be the dumbest person i know
Feb 12 2021,negative,movie was not genuinely scary honestly the scariest part of the movie was when josh showed off his wild chest hairs probably could make a much more frightening  sequel just focusing on joshs hygienes lol so bad that the emotional breakdowns of the characters was basically comedy this should be sold as  a horror movie version of sharknado
Feb 8 2021,negative,when i saw the exocrcist i laughed all the way through but this was dull dull dull  what i leave in the toilet on a daily basis is an academy award nominated worthy horror movie compared to this drivel
Feb 7 2021,positive,im sort of mixed on this movie because im not really sure i quite got it i thought it had a good story im not usually a fan of movies that are filmed with footage but this movie was entertaining i did feel it was short on story and it really doesnt get scary until maybe the last 10 minutes when mike disappears sorry to give out spoilers its really not as scary as i thought it was but it is a good film i just think it could have been planned more
Feb 5 2021,negative,what was all the hype about someone with a hand held camera running around in the woods arguing with friends absolutely bored stiff
Jan 29 2021,positive,i think i was 12 when i first seen this  sacred me stupid nearly 30 and it still gets me
Jan 25 2021,positive,this is a wellexecuted idea for a movie  what exactly is happening throughout the movie is a bit unclear but that really is what gives this movie life  there are no jump scares and i really do appreciate a film that knows how to create horror without them  this really is more of a film rooted in suspense  sometimes the way the characters act can be frustrating because of how uncooperative they are with each other  this does add a bit to the movie though because it makes it feel more realistic  i would say that any person looking for a classic horror film should go for this one
Jan 18 2021,positive,filmed with only two kind of low quality camera in a forest this movie turns out better than expected while watching it you can feel the anxiety of the main characters and the mental instability taking space worth to mention is all the lore and the advertisment campaign that made everything feel real
Jan 12 2021,negative,i cant believe i ever thought this movie was scary  its just an hour and a half of people arguing
Jan 1 2021,negative,i recall a section of my childhood everyone was raving about this as the scariest film ever as a big horror fanatic who has seen everything from the shining and poltergeist to every blumhouse film ever made i finally watched it many years later and what a farce biggest joke i have ever seen disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs 1937 had more fear in it than this a cheap home movie of young people in the woods arguing with each other the entire film is what you get no plot no scare  and the biggest whopper of a scam i have ever heard of  you could not pay me to watch this again the only lesson here is that the internet and social hype are a powerful thing to spread lies and fake events the deadbeats behind the blair witch project have clearly proven that to us thank god found footage filming is on its way out in the film industry
Dec 31 2020,positive,its not bad for a thriller
Dec 22 2020,positive,so fresh  absolute must see you cant go wrong with the queen of found footage films suspense and thrills make this film even better one of the best if not the greatest found footage films of all time would recommend 100100
Dec 22 2020,positive,the acting is almost too real very well done
Dec 1 2020,positive,this movie used to terrify me when i was younger now that i am an adult i understand the whole backstory of the the film and how it was made but still to this day i get creeped out when i think of the ending and unexplained noises when you are outside at night make me go back to some of the events that occur in this movie
Nov 27 2020,positive,even watching 20 years later on a small screen its genuinely terrifying and unsettling cant imagine how scared id have been seeing it at the time in a cinema nightmares forever
Nov 24 2020,negative,an hour and a half of people arguing and yelling
Nov 18 2020,negative,it was a smash hit because it was the very first to use an incredibly original and brilliant idea having that been said its not the least bit scary and the storys dog food
Nov 18 2020,positive,a horror classic that was one of the first popular foundfootage horror films
Nov 14 2020,negative,i think this is actually the worst horror movie i have ever seen if you can even consider this horror the first half of the movie is just three teenagers or young adults getting lost in the woods the second half is just these people screaming each others names which is the only reason you actually remember the names i kept calling the one guy fred and then i realized that his name was actually josh    i can actually see what the director was going for with the shaky cam trying to make it seem ingrained in reality but the writing in my opinion is horrible i have a feeling the writers felt stretched pretty thin with the plot nothing happened because every line was just the fword over and over again i mean i get it the characters are freaked out by a bunch of sticks i guess but did they really have to scream that every single line     eh whatever i dont care that much     honestly going back to the writing its actually quite remarkable how they got me to care so little about the characters its pretty impressive about threequarters of the way in i realized that they could all die and i wouldnt care at all a plane could fall out of the sky cause a giant explosion and i wouldnt care usually with movies i either want the characters to die or i dont want them to die but with this one i just couldnt care less     finally i am extremely surprised that this critic review on rotten tomatoes is the same as perks of being a wallflower which is my favorite movie ever in my opinion the direction is on point for all of the scenes the soundtrack fits perfectly with the mood of the scene and the script is just unbelievable i love all of the characters too and i actually almost cried during it which i never do i didnt cry during titanic the notebook or terms of endearment which are all considered the saddest movies ever if you havent seen perks of being a wallflower i highly recommend it but i think it deserves so much better than blair witch project    of course this is just my opinion
Nov 12 2020,negative,snooze fest quite disappointed actually
Nov 7 2020,positive,terrifyingthe documentary style used to film this horror movie is absolute genius yet i was so scared i do not foresee myself seeing this again
Nov 5 2020,positive,this film is just what my nightmares all about especially the ending the suspense and the scariness is just the best
Nov 4 2020,positive,the blair witch project has to be the most suspenseful movie i have ever seen aside from the 2016 sequel the viral marketing campaign also make this film feel realistic  even though i dont know what the hell happened at the end the blair witch project is a thrill ride form the start to finish i would recommend this movie if you are in mystery movies
Nov 2 2020,neutral,so all in all its worth a watch even after 20 years it still has its own sense of thrill and magic it is incredibly engaging and hard to look away watching the students lose their sense of reality and go insane is definitely captivating however the end of the film leaves a lot to be desired standard story structure is thrown out the window and the climax is at the very very end it lasts all of 1 minute and ends incredibly abrupt
Oct 29 2020,positive,i loved this just goes to show that you can make a huge impact with little 
Oct 28 2020,negative,its such a great concept but its so badly executed its boring so boring that i very nearly fell asleep its shakycam documentary style is all over the place that it made me a little motion sick which has never happened to me before theres next to no character development as all they do for the most part is shout at each other although the acting is actually extremely good i personally think that the movie would have worked better as a 30 minute short film
Oct 26 2020,positive,everyone processes and derives entertainment from horror differently blair witch will appeal to some people and will be an utter borefest for others in my personal opinion if you enjoy more atmospheric horror than upfront blood and gore youll like this movie very much
Oct 25 2020,positive,it might seem campy these days but when it was released  i saw it at a drivein on a cold rainy night and it really freaked me out
Oct 25 2020,positive,one of the best found footage films ever to date it had the strong potential to bore viewers out due to its slowburn treatment but with an eerie unsettling transition of events it keeps the attention of wanting to know more curiosity kills and that is why its really good the performances were one of the best out of the horror genre loved the sound mixing and design and the location to set the story off is almost perfect would definitely recommend to any fan of any genre
Oct 24 2020,positive,the scariest movie ever made in the 1990s
Oct 12 2020,positive,the first movie that made me see that less can be more
Oct 10 2020,positive,an interesting and intimidating found footage film that paved the way for many more to come for the genre and has held up very well
Oct 6 2020,negative,thought it was a comedy the whole time  scariest part was her screaming josh
Sep 7 2020,negative,ive seen tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear i spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for somethinganything to happen just when i thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house nothing happensbig surprise
Sep 3 2020,negative,one of the most over rated movies ive ever seen it has no connection to its story the blair witch will most likely put you to bed then out of the woods in this found footage horror film the suffers from bad acting to poor writng and a supernatrual monster who is never seen on screen not even at the ending
Aug 17 2020,positive,obviously watching this movie isnt going to be as scary for a person watching it in the time of its release date it passed time for me probably because this movie started off the found footage idea which many movies took the idea off and thousands were made
Jul 18 2020,negative,i watched this a few years ago and it is still one of the worst and most boring films ive ever watched was an absolute snorefest i really dont get what people find so spooky or edgy about it
Jul 7 2020,positive,the unpolished realist style of blair witch means it was never going to be a blockbuster but it did bring found footage into the horror genre and remind us as jaws did that what you dont see can be scary the directors choice to have actors shoot themselves and scenes be improvised and mostly undirected means they stay true to the found footage medium which ultimately leads to its popularity thereafter but they lose the kind of artistic opportunities that can help in building suspense or developing characters the most thrilling part the finale is as such because there is a better balance between direction and realism while other parts of the movie are too meandering and undeveloped
Jul 3 2020,negative,i spent the entire time ether really board or rolling my eyes i have seen scarier stuff on sesame street
Jun 28 2020,neutral,still a classic but it wasnt a horror more of a thriller with a unique perspective
Jun 12 2020,positive,the main reason this film is seen as a terrible film towards audiences is because of the fact that this film only had that huge impact back then when it was released before the internet and all that now that it has been revealed to be a work of fiction people start to find it boring i couldnt manage to get the best experience watching this film as this film was released quite a while ago already if you ask me i would not recommend watching this film as a movie for entertainment but more as to remember the great impact this film had on everyone the day it came out im not trying to say that this film cannot make an impact on viewers anymore yes this film can still scare the crap out of people just not as much to those who do not like the movie you may dislike the movie in general but you have to understand that this is the type of film that has a huge impact on viewers only for a period of time appreciate it not as a movie for entertainment but as a piece of art nobody can ever make a film like this again not when the world is constantly progressing in technology and the internet is evergrowing
Jun 10 2020,positive,an original entertaining and fun classic horror film    final rating b
Jun 8 2020,negative,it feels like nothing happens in this movie for the first 60 minutes nauseating acting i havent checked but im sure none of those actors were ever in any notable film ever again the dialogue is is horrible it seems like there was no script at all so they just had to fill in the lack of meaningful dialogue with shouting and vulgarity great idea horrible execution
May 28 2020,positive,i know alot of people dont find this film particulairly scary but to me this was horrifying theres something about eerily filmed movies like creep that are just another level of bone chilling the actingliterally all the actingwas fucking amazing   and way better than the 2016 version lmao and by the end of the movie i had some serious goosebumps strange how a film with minimal gore and jumpscares can get your heart racing like that probably my favorite horror movie 55
May 15 2020,negative,the best review i have heard for this true bomb was as we leaving the theater a woman said i was waiting for something to happen  it never did  if anyone found this thing scary come look at my lawn
May 10 2020,positive,this movie is one of the best horrors i shakes you from start to finnish you must see it
Apr 28 2020,positive,extremely scary i love the fact that the actors went off the grid for a while after the movie was produced to make it look like the movie was real
Apr 17 2020,negative,so the whole movie from start to finish is basically footage from the characters video cameras so the cam is shaky and a huge mess if you like clean neat and smooth camera work you 100 wont like the grainy shaky filming  its a very interesting story line and a really cool concept with the raw footage but the footage and cam work is such a negative distraction
Apr 9 2020,positive,there are fewer films that surpass the blair witch project as a perfect example of hitchcocks notion of terror within the unseen but does it deserve all the credit go
Apr 7 2020,positive,watched alone the movie is less than entertaining and does not deliver the punch and surprise one desires from a horror film  however when viewed within a group the dynamic changes and it delivers the goods  definitely a movie that shows how horror can be infectious among individuals experiencing the same film
Mar 30 2020,positive,this movie is fantastic people love to hate on this film just because of how lazy and cheap it is but it made 240 million dollars and set a new genre it aged badly though today it looks generic and lazy but really that is just because it is the first and even though i say this with discrimination to most firsts this is actually an excellent movie these stupid kids get lost and they hear something in the woods thats about it creepy right uh yeah creepy asf this film does an excellent job as showing fear anxiety paranoia darkness and many other things it is just a creepy woods movie that does it just right and its that simple i definitely recommend this film and they did a great job on a low budget
Mar 30 2020,positive,i enjoyed this movie very much proves the old horror movie adage dont go in the woods
Mar 27 2020,positive,obviously genius blew my 7 year old selfs tiny mind
Mar 26 2020,positive,confusing creepy ending and nonetheless well done for one of the first if not the first found footage horror stories
Mar 22 2020,positive,so scary so into it
Mar 20 2020,negative,this could be my least favorite horror movie ive ever seen even though it went with the whole well leave it to the audiences imagination technique which for this type of movie is the smart thing to do it failed to scare thats where this movie fails big time aggravating is the word id use to describe this founder of foundfootage movies the worst subgenre we have today ill give the halfstar for its creative and successful marketing
Mar 17 2020,positive,a true original in its time the atmospheric low budget genuinely haunting independent horror film that has gone on to be revered as a masterpiece of the genre and the most successful independent film ever up that point 1999s the blair witch project remains the standard for greatness of which all found footage horror films are compared and hardly ever measure up granted the found footage film has lost some of its polish and sparkle since 1999 and all or nearly all of its originality even the found footage premise has fallen greatly out of favor over the years as a hack and a gimmick not to mention the dizzying vertigo and nausea inducing  feelings that the handheld camera work can cause insert cloverfield here the blair witch project by contrast has none of that and perhaps because it was the first the originator its very difficult to see it as cliche more as an authentic affectingly sparse and at times chillingly straightforward founding father of the subgenre and the fist proof that low budget independent films can also make money a lot of money even so none of that by any means diminishes the fact that its still an excellent film and that the old fears like darkness the unseen and being lost with no hopes of finding your way still have the power to get under under our skin i saw this film originally with just one other person with me and in the absolute best place one could ever see this film on a friday midnight showing in the complete dark sitting in my car at my states last drivein theater that was surrounded by dark tangled and massive woods on three sides including behind the giant screen itself it was utterly terrifying which was something i had not experienced with a horror movie since i had watched the exorcist on hbo alone in my bedroom at night in an empty house so good was it in fact that my boyfriend and i had to go back the next night and see an encore performance a lot has changed since this movie debuted in the late 90s we have cell phones and social media now and most of the driveins are all gone now sadly very sadly that includes what was my states last drive in theater where i originally saw this film most people watch horror movies on their streaming service on their small screened laptop or phone screen and constantly check their social media or play candy crush while a film is playing the style and atmosphere needed for a good scare are not what they once were its a louder less still more distracted less present world we live in now which makes it harder and harder for people to be totally in the moment and totally focused on just one singular thing at a time which you actually have to be for this film to be affective granted repeat viewings watched in the modern world we live in now show the glaring datedness of the film that spawned an entire new subgenre of horror films the found footage horror movie but it was the original and in my opinion still the best at showing you less to creep you out more the film that proved once again that our fear of the unknown and unseen while you are also lost with no way out can be a million times more terrifying than crazed in your face gore complete with a slasher cutting it up on the big screen still i will never forget the first time i saw it which seems like it was a lifetime ago now despite that i remember how it delivered big time if youve never seen it its worth a viewing if only to see the true originator and still the best of found footage films turn your phone off dont look at your computer watch with the lights out on a big tv screen and alone if possible its worthy of your attention if youve seen it before revisit it remember why you liked it see above for viewing suggestion personally i still love it and ive never really forgotten it because theres still a small part of me thats remains at that drive in in the woods holding my breath and checking the tree line while the kids on the screen descend into burkittsville madness
Mar 10 2020,positive,spooky freaky mysterious overall a very well made horror film its about found footage of a couple of people who go missing in the woods
Feb 25 2020,positive,the blair witch project was one of the first and most successful found footage films and it remains one of the best the chillingly realistic premise and performances help the film overcome a general sense that not much really happens b
Feb 9 2020,positive,the most effective found footage horror movie absolutely terrifying
Jan 14 2020,positive,one of the best horror movies ive ever seen also im a big fan of foundfootage movies this is a great horror film to watch with your friends its a great experience
Jan 4 2020,positive,its a very divisive movie in the horror community some site its box office of 2486 million on a budget of 60000 its genius viral marketing campaign and its effectiveness of creating tension and fear without ever showing anything as reasons it is a good film others find the lack of payoff frustrating and the nauseating camera work doesnt win some over i find myself on the side of those who like this film sometimes less is more and the blair witch project is one of those times the evil thats after the stars of the film is faceless and that allows us the viewing audience to fill our own darkest fears in the blank there really is nothing quite like the fear of the unknown this movie scared the hell out of me as a kid and to this day the ending combined with the haunting tune played during the end credits gives me chills
Dec 24 2019,positive,you do feel that there is a witch out in the woods trying to kill them but more then that you get to see the unraveling of three central characters
Dec 24 2019,negative,this movie makes me sick because the screen is a shaking too much arguing and lengthy meaningless story and the grotesque scene is too cheap and too short to be called a horror movie i even fell asleep during this movie i really dont understand why this movie is rated so high
Dec 9 2019,positive,terrifying and absolutely original
Dec 3 2019,positive,i remember the buildup to the the blair witch project  one of the first instances of fake realism or is it guerrilla marketing that got you intrigued about a film  and then seeing it on its opening weekend even after all these years i still get chills at how scary nerve wracking edge of your seat the blair witch project was one of the best horror films ever
Nov 22 2019,positive,a boring plot weighs down what could have been a great movie it still gets credit for a good ending and kickstarting the found footage genre
Nov 12 2019,positive,a dedicated horror film that absolutely asks of your imagination but really lets be real here the productionpromotion the acting here and for its time the film definitely deserves some applause   also watching this film in the dark yeah thats a hard no b  7310
Nov 11 2019,positive,a neverforgotten physcological thriller is placed perfectly into its setting script and actor portrayals  1010
Nov 4 2019,negative,this movie was unbelievably boring there was nothing interesting about it other than the documentaryesque format
Nov 1 2019,negative,was expecting more from this movie hearing that it was the start of the found footage movies wasnt a whole lot going on in the movie
Oct 26 2019,positive,surprisingly good reccomend the raw form of psychothriller
Oct 25 2019,negative,i cant believe any critic bought into this thing what a cheap piecei went to see it when it first came out and people leftthey tried to make it seem that it was real which it wasnt and they spent so little cash on it  it looked so bad
Oct 18 2019,positive,it seems casual at first but watch the whole movie alone at night with no lights on and im positive youll be scared     good movie 
Oct 17 2019,positive,too sacry but i never saw witch
Oct 11 2019,negative,i give it credit for being one of the founders of found footage films that being said nothing really happens in the movie its mostly just walking filler that fluffs its run time dramamine is suggested to watch this if you get nauseous easily i never really felt any sense of dread or real terror its sad because this movie has such a big following
Sep 26 2019,negative,absolute pile of so called horror low garbage budget movie apart from the end this film is a snooze fest
Sep 14 2019,positive,this is my goto horror movie when i talk about the scariest movies i have seen my husband and i saw it in the theater the day it came out and the mass hysteria the movie created was insane i had tears from the fear but the grown man beside me was weeping it was insane    watching at home is not quite the same experience but the movie is still incredibly scary because it was done so simply there is a lot to say for mind games over jump scares    i love this movie
Sep 9 2019,positive,this horror film makes you experience the desperation of the protagonists totally thrilling and awesome
Sep 1 2019,negative,acting was great horrible movie just plain horrible
Aug 19 2019,positive,the best foundfootage film to date the frustration and terror from the cast really makes the film believable and its a perfect of example of what you dont see is much much better
Jul 28 2019,positive,not as scary as i hoped it would be but its a wellpaced film i can tell why it was landmark if they made a few tweaks to the film it wouldve been perfect but alas 
Jul 13 2019,positive,even though i was familiar with the films setting ie walk five miles in any direction and youll hit a road i was genuinely scared when i watched this picture  i love horror films that dont rely on bigbudget effects and this is one of the best ive ever viewed
Jul 13 2019,negative,scariest thing about this excrement is how much  was wasted on it it sucked
Jul 3 2019,negative,i think i want my money back this would have been a short 1015 minutes masterpiece rather was an hour and a half disaster got to give it one star for the last scene
Jun 7 2019,positive,this is what real horror is about sometimes leaving things to the imagination makes it scarier a true clasic
May 29 2019,positive,posted on may 29 2019 by jortegasa78 it was a bold movie that forever changed the way that movies were made thats the line that we are often told about this movie and its mostly correct it was somewhat bold the idea of lost footage was not new but it somehow caught the imagination of the public it came out during a time when the genre of horror was starting to be reborn the late 80s into the early 90s saw horror slip into one unforgettable trash movie after another then came scream and everything changed by the time this movie came around the public was ready for something new and they got it the movie honestly is not that great it has a somewhat weak story that would make for a great book more then a great movie something is out in the forrest and a group of filmmakers go out to do a documentary about it the acting is all around awful at times we dont see much of anything and the ending left so many wanting more and that i think is the key to this movie it gave us just enough that left us hungry for more we wanted it to be real sure it was not the first movie to have the idea but it was a movie that tapped into the publics love for lore of the unknown we knew that it was not real but what if im not sure if horror movies will ever go away people love them and they make a lot of money for those in hollywood scream night have awoken our current love of horror movies but it was in blair witch that it went from a killer with a knife to a force that you couldnt hide from so should you see this yes at least once it took me almost 20 years to watch it was it great no but it was still creepy i happen to love folklore and then ideas in this movie tapped beautifully into that idea that there are things we can not explain watch it and then go camping and tell me that it doesnt make you stay up all night
May 19 2019,neutral,its okay but the acting is just terrible and i mean dreadful it really is  not scary and nothing really happens to be honest
May 6 2019,positive,two decades since we were introduced to the mythos and film that brought back the found footage horror genre in incalculable ways √¢ the blair witch project remains the same monster it was in 1999 a film that spends 90 minutes with 3 people getting lost in the woods all while explaining how their projectfilm will definitively prove the nonexistence of said monster responsible for their being lost in the woodsoh and did i mention theres not a single james wanthe conjuringesque wommm jump scare in the entire thing there are none that somber quiet approach paid off in ways that every found footage imitator since has consistently failed perhaps there are valuable horror lessons to be gleamed from films like tbwp √¢ and maybe there exists an entirely uniqueoriginal niche just waiting to haunt us while we sleep much like this one did in √¢99 and still does to anyone with any sort of imagination       ps blair witch 2 2000 was a disaster because of the studio but there exists among the internets dark corners a digital copy of a rather amazing fanedit i know you see those words and think nope ill pass on anything thats a fanedit but trust me √¢ see this one out it was made from a pretty exact blueprint described by that films director commentary and other statements regarding the many things changed against his strongest pleas the studio screwed that director over big time all so they could get an earlier theatrical release and appease their braindead test audiences who would sooner recommend schlock than ever go near a film that pressed them with genuine psychological horror just saying
Apr 27 2019,positive,9510  an exercise in slowbuilding terror that works on nearly every level
Apr 26 2019,positive,im 25 and till now cant watch this alone simply the scariest movie ever made
Apr 19 2019,positive,one of my alltime favorites
Apr 14 2019,positive,one of the best horror movies to this day with intense emotions and an unforgettable ending
Mar 28 2019,positive,the camera does shake a lot but still its a classic and its amazing     grade b
Mar 17 2019,negative,this has to be the worst motion picture ever made the only reason we didnt walk out is because we were sure something would finally happen but it never did 
Mar 5 2019,positive,i saw this when it was in theaters when it was still being hailed as real i was 14 years old at the time and this was the first horror movie i saw in theaters i think its memorable just for that it was a old movie theaater as well which made the experience even scarier out of my dad  my brothers  and i  i was the only one who liked it years and multiple viewings later its heavilly dated
Mar 3 2019,negative,very bad movie camera kept shaking and you never saw what you wanted to see
Feb 25 2019,positive,you dont need the best 3d effects and the most expensive actors to make a great movie the blair witch project is a proof of that i like the fact that the actors are unknown it helps to give the impression that is real
Feb 10 2019,negative,three young people yelling at each other in the woods with no scares
Jan 17 2019,positive,loved it and have watched it at least 7 times family is from burkittsville
Jan 16 2019,positive,a testament to the power of lowbudget indie films and early online marketing simple clever and frightening use of minimalism
Dec 18 2018,positive,great atmospheric horror movie with good performances kinda dont get the hate
Nov 30 2018,neutral,found footage classic and practical inventor of the genre not my style
Nov 26 2018,positive,a horrifying movie that left me shaking
Nov 16 2018,positive,still really like this film  even though you see nothing scary it makes you think and use your imagination  ground breaking genre the original and best
Nov 12 2018,negative,the only time i have ever left the theater completely angry that i wasted 90 minutes of my live  complete rubbish
Nov 5 2018,positive,highly effective low budget suspense film which depends on audience imagination 50000 budget film grosses 50 million
Nov 3 2018,negative,the acting was phenomenal but the story was flat and lifeless
Nov 3 2018,positive,a feminist interpretation lurks in these shadows wait for it
Nov 3 2018,negative,awful just utterly awful 90 minutes of my life i will never get back
Oct 23 2018,positive,the look didnt age well but it does have scary moments
Oct 21 2018,positive,this was a long time ago the first film i watched of the foundfootage genre that saw me and a friend overindulging in anything that remotely resembled this format slow paced and slowly building i cant say i was scared at any stage during this i feel as though that would have been secondary to seeing a fairly new take on horror which paired with a brilliant advertising campaign puts this high on my list of favourite horrors
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was revolutionary for its time  while we can look at it today with some of its faults i remember being a teenager when it came out and absolutely loving it
Oct 18 2018,positive,its creepy for sure with a very suspenseful formula that leaves you excited for the next thrill scene problem is theres too much left to the imagination and youre left with only a semi satisfying ending
Oct 12 2018,negative,biggest waste of my time dont watch it
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the best foundfootage films ever
Oct 2 2018,negative,biggest waste of time ending was absolute trash
Sep 1 2018,negative,this has got to be the most overrated movie of all time not scary at all dont believe everything and every hype you hear this is a complete waste of time and is not scary  the camera coverage is horrible as well  if i put it on mute i wouldnt even know it was a horror it would just seem like a bunch of dorky young people lost in the woods bickering amongst another this movie hands down is the most and i repeat the most overrated piece of trash ive ever watched and it would take a lot to surpass it in being so overrated
Sep 1 2018,positive,a landmark of horror entertainment the blair witch project is the chilling shocking and creative gateway to the reliably effective foundfootage subgenre
Aug 22 2018,positive,awesome for low budget movie
Aug 17 2018,negative,well this movie certainly had a creative marketing campaign ill admit the movie was groundbreaking and there are a few instances which sent chills down my spine but the blair witch project isnt that scary everyone says its a horror movie except i only saw three college students arguing with each other its fun to guess just who exactly the blair witch is and the performances are a lot better than the golden raspberry the girl was given might imply the blair witch project is a product of its time and while the actors had to do their best with what the shoestring budget allowed i dont understand why its being treated as really scary sigh
Jul 15 2018,positive,spooky creepy eerie fun
Jun 27 2018,positive,it felt like that you were the one who actually in the footage
Jun 13 2018,negative,this pickture reminds me of something my son becket made with my wife in our field before she ran waay with the photography mahcine now the directer madum could have had the which make an apperance but this movie was even poorer than me to be so  boring1 i was completly an utterly disapointed by this act of cinematic mutiny by anitclimax
Jun 12 2018,positive,a chilling and disturbing film that launched the found footage genre with great atmosphere natural performances and a claustrophobic tension that seems to increase throughout the entire duration this is the genre at its apex
Jun 3 2018,negative,do not trust any of the hype on this movie honestly if you enjoy a movie about whiney kids walking around in a whiney forest whining about the map whining to each other than you will like this film at the time of its release pretty much the only two reasons for its insane popularity was for the marketing campaign and it was one of the first movies to present them selfs as a found footage film the marketing campaign of this was very good but now that weve seen a million found footage horror movies and we can see passed the marketing campaign its terrible it is pretentious tedious extremely boring anti climatic unscary and most of all immensely annoying i had the biggest headache when i was done with this mess dont watch it
May 31 2018,negative,though i respect that it started a new genre of film it just flat out isnt good lol 
Apr 14 2018,negative,i dont think i could make a worse movie if i tried if i were to use every ounce in my body to make a movie as terrible as my body would physically allow blair witch would still be worse i would rather watch a documentary on how rice cakes are made before watching this movie again some old movies i can understand why they wouldve been scary back in their time but this movie i am still at a loss of how this was ever scary if i ever have to hear that girls voice again theres a very good chance i end it all if you ever forget that the group lost the map that bitch will let you know asap and she will do so very loudly with obnoxious intent i watched this movie by myself at night and wasnt scared in the least bit in fact the only thing that the movie was good at was casting actors that were exceptional at whining wouldnt watch this movie again if my mothers life depended on it 
Mar 14 2018,negative,the most infuriatingly disappointing movie of all time speaking of time do not waste yours
Mar 9 2018,positive,masterfully shot and truely overwhelming
Feb 19 2018,positive,the blair witch project has a great idea behind it and seems very scary and real when you start the film but near the end of the film i was barely scared at all the scares are very minamal and i expected a lot more coming in but the documentary style of the film helped me feel more emerged into the setting and thats why im giving this film 35
Feb 8 2018,negative,this movie sucked when it came out and it sucks now
Jan 29 2018,positive,i think is one of the few horror movie that really scared me i dont mean the classical aaaaahhhh in the middle of a quite scene kind of scared i mean the is someone following me kind after leaving the cinema i kinda can guess why younger generations wont like it but for me is still one of the best horrors ever made
Jan 19 2018,negative,the blair witch project is a movie that i knew a bit too much about before going in and it took awhile before i could put aside what i knew was happening and just try to get absorbed in the story it would be easier if these kids were better actors the way they deliver lines is so artificial that im a little surprised anyone thought this was a real thing that happened theres a reason that none of these three stars have had a big breakout career after appearing in this movie particularly obnoxious is heather donahue who is bossy and annoying through almost the whole thing the one part that worked was their fear when things really started to fall apart it was convincing that they were terrified the shaky handheld camera work was only obnoxious a few times it almost seemed like most of the truly bad running was in the dark so you couldnt see what was going on there is a fair amount of dark footage during the nights which is frustrating because you want to see more of what is happening but you could kind of get the gist of things based solely on the audio its surprising how much drama they were able to create without anything actually happening through most of the movie i expected to become bored but it never quite got to that point sure the setting is repetitive because it feels like they shot everything in a few small acres of land but it still worked okay my biggest problem with the blair witch project is the same struggle i have with most found footage horrordisaster films i cant turn off my brain from thinking about the logic like the nagging question of why are they still filming when things have fallen apart to this extreme they attempt to justify it in some scenes because the characters were too dumb to bring flashlights so they need the camera lights but still the daytime stuff still doesnt make sense then i see that were clearly not watching something that could be confused as raw footage because shots have been edited and there are clear cuts so if someone edited the footage why didnt they cut out some of the pointless stuff like asking only one person for permission to film him it takes me out of the film completely despite everything i hated about the blair witch project it was fairly effective at what it was trying to do and i can see why it was such a phenomenon among people who like the genre
Jan 3 2018,negative,watching people jump at the sound of twigs breaking for a full length film is not a good horror movie or movie in general
Dec 29 2017,positive,too surreal even for me the horror genre lover
Nov 9 2017,positive,no body likes it but it made a ton of money and they have been copying it for 18 years
Nov 3 2017,positive,the most overrated film in the world of cinema the film has a good plot and it is very interesting the end is very good it creates tension the first 50 minutes are very boring and desperate this is not even a horror movie but well its a psychological thriller its just a clumsy movie and thats it
Nov 2 2017,positive,further proving that what we dont see can be just as terrifying if not even more than what we do see the blair witch project is a mostly terrifying and unique entry into the horror genre the performances are very realistic and solid for the most part channeling pure terror and fear into their roles the actors perfectly get across and convey the horror of whats going on around them this can be a detriment to the film as much as it is a good thing mostly down to the fact that although their acting is rather convincing and appropriate given the subject matter it can also feel a bit over the top and relentlessly obnoxious especially since it can feel as if its just a bunch of panicking and screaming concerning the mythology surrounding the blair witch project the film does an interesting job exploring the legend while establishing a solid foundation to build upon as the film goes on it doesnt delve too much into this fact though however the film benefits from a very strong build up as events get worse and worse steadily before the insane ending its hard to tell whats going to happen at any given time and the film maintains this feeling throughout benefiting from strong direction myrick successfully manages to build a haunting and spooky atmosphere while including some subtle yet intriguing hints at the supernatural events going on the use of found footage is very original and creative lending the film a more authentic and realistic feel that in turn makes the film even more terrifying but i can also work on the lesser side as well it works mainly because since its told through the use of camera we dont actually get to see anything thats going on and yet the film still manages to be as scary as it wants to be thanks to some crackling sound effects and the films claustrophobic tone its not all that scary though even with its plethora of creativity and the cameras tendency to blur and move around so often can give the impressions of fright as much as it can give you the impression that theres nothing really going on the blair witch project is a crative and unique horror film that still proves even with its flaws that there are some things out there that are better left unseen 
Oct 26 2017,negative,one of the few movies i ever wanted a refund for
Oct 22 2017,positive,didnt really so much start the reality horror genre as much as it sensationalized and commercialized it for jaded internet users still made the deep woods scary again
Oct 15 2017,positive,a horror masterpiece
Oct 13 2017,negative,a stupid cliche and boring  horror movie that started  a series of more boring horror movies
Oct 9 2017,positive,i dont know why people dont like this movie i think its pretty original for the most part and i kind of like the fact that they dont ever show any witch or monster the vagueness of this movie is what makes it so special you know theres something out there but youre not sure what it is sometimes in real life you just dont ever get the answer deal with it
Oct 9 2017,positive,spooky af anticlimactic ending
Oct 6 2017,negative,terrible boring horror movie
Oct 4 2017,negative,three student film makers go to the woods and walk and walk and walk and walk and walk and oh my god just die already    seduced by all the hype i went to see the movie when it was first released in theaters you may have heard legends of the movie making people physically ill im here to tell you that legend is true as i am one of the viewers who suffered from motion sickness from all the shaky cam it got to the point where i couldnt look at the screen and had to look off at an exit sign and just listen to the movie then when it was finally over i ended up puking in the parking lot    not that i missed all that much by not looking at the screen as my opening line accurately states most of this thriller is about people walking through the woods and asking where are we
Sep 8 2017,positive,this movie is just a horror classic that i can always go back and rewatch for a good scare i love the home video aspect of it the acting is low key and very realistic perfect for this style of film watching it now is especially nostalgic for me with all of the 90s music clothes and references its just really fun to watch  especially when youre alone in the dark
Sep 2 2017,positive,liked it film makers want you to believe blair witch is real and out there killing children
Aug 23 2017,negative,to cut to the chase this the most boring so called horror movie ive ever watched there is no suspense whatsoever through the entire film and unless you like watching scripted footage of people getting lost while camping which is literally the entire movie or you just take enjoyment out of being bored then i cannot recommend film dont waste 15 hours of your life
Aug 14 2017,negative,what a stupid movie this is it was all by mouth youve gotta see this movie  after 30 minutes my partner and i walked out of the theater  the movie was made on a budget of only 20000 but grossed 300 million i guess i am not as gullible as to give it a 5 star rating
Aug 8 2017,positive,i remember watching this movie back in 1999  and i wanted to rewatch it because i had not seen it since  the acting is very genuine by the 3 friends who go hikinginvestigating  in the woods  yes there are a lot of bad words but some people just talk that way that didnt bother me at all about the movie  the friends get lost in the woods and then little by little strange things start happening to them when they are about to sleep at night  the best part of this movie is in creating a very uncomfortable atmosphere around the main characters         for me this film could have been great but it disappoints at the end  its like expecting a volcano to erupt and it never really happens  what exactly made the friend disappear  with such a creepy atmosphere why didnt they push the point further  how about a shadow figure teasing in the background  or in the house  this is why people who gave this movie a bad rating really disliked the film  i dont really dislike the movie but it fell short during the last 15 minutes  two possible fixes  1 show some sort of entity or entities to make it better  or  2 add a few extra minutes to the ending to somehow tie everything nicely   good overall but it could have been great  i do like its originality though at the time    i rate it 35  or   610
Aug 6 2017,negative,this is the worst movie ive ever seenpure garbage absolutely nothing ever happens
Jul 28 2017,negative,you never get to see the wich crap camera angles and poor acting not to mention it was very boring the new movie you get see her and way better story line
Jul 26 2017,positive,it was ok the 1st part was boring and the ending was abrupt and confusing but i do like the story of how it invented the horror genre of found footage films like paranormal activity
Jul 25 2017,negative,its not scary and its not interesting  it sucked
Jul 24 2017,negative,movie about a group of kids in the woods who get lost while looking for some ghost or witch or demon or something bad the hype for this movie back in 1999 was insane never understood why its terrible dont waste your time
Jul 13 2017,negative,im going to say this right off the bat  this movie did not hold up at all i just watched the blair witch project for the first time in 2017 and after hearing all the hype from people that ive heard talk about this movie i am stunned at how much it let me down however after doing some further research on why this could have been it makes a little more sense why i really hated this movie this movie was released in 1999 so already its almost 20 years old and horror movies age terribly because as the years progress whats scary and whats not changes at a fast race because each horror movie pushes the next if you were to watch a horror movie from the 80s it would almost be more of a comedy than a horror because of how cheesy it looks which is the exact same i felt about this movie i felt like i just watched an hour of nothing followed by about 20 minutes of very light horror and then a chilling end the only thing that i liked in this movie the first 40 minutes were literally just 3 people wandering in the forest arguing about losing a map and trying to get home with every 20 minutes something scary happening to them seriously nothing happened in this movie however back in 1999 the way this movie was advertised people actually thought this was real so i could see why this would disturb and terrify a lot of people because the way its shot it genuinely looks like it was just shot by a few kids with a video camera it was one of the pioneers of video camera horror movies so ill give it some pointers for that however now that i know all of this is fake it was so boring it took every ounce of strength for me to keep watching its extremely hard to make a horror movie that will be endless in terms of its ability to act as a genuinely scary movie in fact i think the exorcist and maybe the shining are the only ones that stand out in my head that could be timeless horror movies but the blair witch project is definitely not one of them i can see why people enjoyed this movie in 1999 but in 2017 the blair witch project is definitely not worth watching
Jul 7 2017,negative,worst horror movie ever i watched it and i honestly have never seen a movie less terrible the part where they found rocks in front of there tent stacked it isnt scary at all the ending was just a guy who was possible their friend standing near a wall and we didnt even see the so called witch there is a hundred million things i would rather do then watch it waste of time
Jul 4 2017,positive,this is one of the most disturbing films ive seen   ive seen the shining halloweenthe exorcist psycho the texas chainsaw massacre those are all horror films that i respect and love but they didnt quite pack the unsettling punch that tbwp did for me why to sort of quote stephen kings thoughts on the film the damn thing feels real the movies amateurish camera work combined with the actors very naturalistic performances and the directors very unhollywood approach to getting scares from both said actors and the audience all come together to create a truly nightmarish experience that feels real  i respect this film so much for giving me a genuinely unique experience when it came to horror it is the perfect example of less being more
Jun 17 2017,positive,a landmark film in the genre lingering dread builds subtly until all of a sudden you realise your heart is in your mouth
Jun 14 2017,negative,initially i was extremely bored by this relatively short horrorthriller from 1999  it features an unknown cast who at times seem to give quite frankly annoying performances  the film follows a group of three students with plenty of time available to investigate a witch story in the town of burkitsville nee blair maryland us a forest town  they film their story using a camcorder to record footage of their entry to the haunted forest  one of the three is called josh joshua leonard who is the first to go missing  the other two protagonists are heather donohue and michael williams the actors actual names  heather has a shrieking voice that drove me off the film it was only the relatively short running time of 80 or so minutes that kept my attention  heather and michael enter a house in the forest thinking they had heard joshs voice   upon entering the property the footage abruptly ends after seeing handprints on the walls  relatively biring storyline however the actors filmed their own footage and adlibbed their lines apparently  josh
May 29 2017,positive,the blair witch project was a game changer in the horror genre and still scares audiences to this day
May 5 2017,positive,probably will go down as the greatest found footage horror film ever and rightfully so
Apr 29 2017,negative,05 star just for the final scene which is creepy otherwise its boring
Apr 27 2017,positive,i want to know where she bought batteries to her camera
Apr 24 2017,positive,the blair witch project is one of the scariest movie ive ever seen it is very creepy and felt so real which added to the fear factor i almost thought it was real but i had to keep reminding myself that it wasnt this film just feels so real it scared me so much this also felt new because it was a found footage film that is something id never seen before now the found footage genre isnt very good anymore because this movie created a formula that almost every found footage movie uses nowadays this was good because it was new and is the original the plot is kinda simple and is pretty easy to follow the ending will make you think though the ending might leave you a little confused but its just so thought provoking it really will make you think overall this is an extremely scary movie with a good plot that is simple and pretty easy to follow a
Apr 9 2017,positive,one of the few movies to still freak me out
Mar 31 2017,negative,the blair witch project makes a good attempt at being creepy by relying on the unseen but ultimately ends up being a boring shaky and anticlimactic experience its probably one of the better foundfootagemockumentary films out there but that really isnt saying much
Mar 31 2017,negative,before i watched this film i heard of people calling it the scariest movie of all time with some even scared to walk in the woods because of it after watching this it is a boring nonscary uncreative and overall stupid movie anyone could make this film in a day but it would just be a waste of time not recommended
Mar 23 2017,negative,this film is just stupid i love psychological and found footage horror films i am one of those people who think that what exists in your imagination can be as scary as any monster or serial killer you see on screen however this movie lacks everything you need for an effective horror film there is no suspense and no story for that matter either the entire story is a college student freaking out about stupid useless things like piles of rocks that werent there the night before outside their tent and then arguing with her friends about it this story is also very slow and deliberate but for that to work effectively there needs to be suspense building throughout the film this movie has no scares suspense nothing to make it a memorable film there are far better horror films out there both psychological and found footage quarantine is better than this by miles which is saying something do not recommend to anyone unless what i described above is your idea of terrifying
Feb 27 2017,positive,910 slow burning and relentlessly tense the blair witch project makes devastatingly scary use of setting and imagination to frighten viewers the naturalist performances of the amateur documentary crew gone missing are perfect so that they were able to convince thousands of theater goers across the nation that the horrors they had witnessed were authentic shot on a budget of less than 60000 the pair of writersdirectorseditors daniel myrick and eduardo s√°nchez use minimalist natural elements  literally sticks and stones  to rile the imagination of viewers as what goes unseen is often as terrifying as anything seen on screen this is a film that will imprint on any person that grew up immersed in americas great woodland expanses and will convince city goers to never ever ever go camping or hiking the final scene is worthy of its iconic status and the film as a whole is deserving of the reverence it receives though the decade and a halflong foundfootage fad it instigated has largely receded its influence is still felt in in countless indie films and big budget pictures that rely on smart lofi tension building to effectively spook their spectators
Feb 12 2017,negative,i find it hard to see how this movie was ever rated as a scary movie its an hour and fifteen minutes of nonsense and two minutes of fear watch this movie if youre into tedious hiking documentaries with a tiny little bit of enjoyment thrown at you right at the very end only to be greeted with the credits i appreciate its supposed to be caught on cam moments but really it had potential to scare the ending had potential to be the actual plot wasted effort
Feb 6 2017,positive,irrational fears that is what this movie is all about  three students are making a documentary on an old legend the blair witch the legend says that witches used to slaughter kids in a forest near a village they decide to go venture deep in the forest but several days past and troubles begin  the blair witch is incredible in a sense that it nearly shows nothing the young people who are shooting their documentary are hearing noises screeching witchcrafts artefacts but they never get anything supernatural on cam the buildup of this movie is amazing the characters are slowly losing their minds and hope they start to panic every second on something they are not even seeing and that is the beauty of this movie it is your childhood fears the ones your parents told you not to worry about because they arent even true but they are real and still you cannot see them but you know they are nearby  honestly stunning even though the movie is pretty slowpaced and there is not much story told it is really a pleasure to watch i recommend you watch it all alone of course
Feb 3 2017,positive,not greatest but ive seen much worse ff movies and this was basically the 1st of the ff style in the horror genre so even after all the hype i heard of this moviei didnt have high hopes but i liked it
Jan 25 2017,negative,one of the most overrated hyped piles of garbage ever they filmed it all with a shaky video camera on a shoestring budget and passed it off as a horror movie 90 minutes of lame closeups of tears and runny noses is not scary
Jan 14 2017,positive,i may just have a more positive view of this film due to the nostalgia of my first viewing i was young child who fully bought into the found footage realism of the movie the simplicity on display still remains effective and scary this one truly started and perfected this style of filmmaking and imitators will never quite be able to replicate its success even though they try desperately to do so
Jan 12 2017,positive,the film is atmosphere taste very whelm over creepy message than 30 minutes character sayin
Jan 10 2017,negative,very boring not in anyway terrorfying and filled with plot holes
Jan 6 2017,positive,still a creepy and unique viewing experience
Jan 3 2017,positive,the year 1999 began and ended with lots of oneofakind or may i say landmark movies which established themselves as a foundation for a genre initially unexplored by the elites of movie makers few of the most notable works of the year includes fight club the matrix american beauty the sixth sense and being john malkovich amongst many others you must already know where i am heading with these movie titles yes thats right the common factor that binds all of these six movies is their brilliant portrayal of human psyche the audacity of these movies lies in their attempt to challenge the rational reasoning of audience and by the time the movie ends the audience questions his intellect regarding his anticipation and understanding of the movie the blair witch project does all of that and a tad bit more but one might say that it still went unheeded from the sight of mainstream audience     nearly a decade before paranormal activity the blair witch project happened and was the first   i have intentionally excluded cannibal holocaust 1980 because of its genre to experiment with the found footage psychological horror genre which later gained such remarkable mainstream success that it spawned seven installments of paranormal activity rec and many others the blair witch project does so less in 105 minutes yet in its own way forces us to cogitate over the definition of horror and to experience horror the film is an exploitation of the most fearsome element of the genre the very thought of being haunted by an obscure supernatural entity whom you can neither see nor confront    the film is about three aspiring documentarians who wander off into the woods with the hopes of finding some reminiscence of the blair witch legend long before the plot unfolds itself we already know of their fate  thanks to the opening introduction of the movie which informs us of their disappearance and implies that they are probably dead with what happened to them out of the line that leaves us with how it happened now a usual horror movie would go about showing us the exploits of the witch gruesome murder of protagonists and eerie sound effects from the thirdperson perspective this is where the film deviates from the aforementioned mainstream tested and approved technique and adopts an unconventional at the time manner of storytelling found footage enables the film to engage us audiences to experience fear and dread of being haunted from firstperson perspective for i felt as if i was the fourth crew member holding the camera and filming the documentary and one of the elements in the film which i found to be remarkable is that the violence or melancholia inflicted by the witch in the past is never actually shown in the movie but rather presented as the legend through use of manufactured newspaper articles newsreels television news reports and staged interviews this creative way of narration successfully manages to form an image of the witch in the mind of the viewer by replacing the need to actually show the witch    the plot is fairly simple and straight forward without any twists and turns it has all the ingredients of different varieties of characters usually found in a typical horror movie  doomed protagonists a crazy legendbeliever who has been personally traumatized by the supernatural entity the naysayers and the forbidding one who would ask to leave the ghost alone and i couldnt to this day forget that the crazy legendbeliever in this film is a special one for she is a selfproclaimed ballerina a historian writing on american history and also a scientist at department of energy and i used to think that i was the ultimate allrounder  it doesnt really take much time for audiences to realize that the movie isnt really about the witch but rather it is a study of characters among the three principal characters the woman heather is the most memorable one and not in a very good way one may find heather as obnoxious and over smartwoman who would not stop arguing over camera business and who at times would not mind some whiskey and toke the manner of shift in characters persona in face of dismay is depicted in a constructive way allowing the film to use it as a effective tool for provoking and upsetting the audience     incorporating the religious scriptures in the script has always been the most reliable method of providing the authenticity or the background to support the occurrence of horror the blair witch project brilliantly uses the biblical story of jacob from genesis 3139 wherein he piles up stones between himself and laban to signify the separation of territories  same pile of stones are frequently  shown in the film which filmmakers must have intended to depict  the territory of the witch and one might have easily noticed that all the havoc started after one of these piles were stepped upon by the cameraman the film has no music score throughout its length which is why i guess heathers persona was designed as talkative and annoying to balance out the awkward silence that otherwise would have prevailed it might amuse you if i said that the movie started with the voice of heather and ended with her scream    i must not tell the famous and much debated ending it tries to reenact the witchlegend    the best thing that can be said about the film i think is that it works myrick and sanchez have taken up a very simple concept and made it believable right up to the end in this sense it even outdoes paranormal activity
Dec 17 2016,positive,a movie that still keeps me up at night to this day while a movie like blair witch gets mixed results it once again all depends on your opinion of horror to me the unknown is terrifying your imagination is terrifying and blair witch delivers just that
Nov 29 2016,positive,subtle realistic and very creepy atmosphere the blair witch project proves that horror movies dont always have to show the monster for it to be scary
Nov 26 2016,negative,boring uneventful and pointless the blair witch project fails completely in every level
Nov 15 2016,negative,this movie was tons of hype and nothing but let down in when you finally saw it i am not sure if its the first found footage movie but it certainly made me hate them couldnt keep my attention
Nov 5 2016,negative,blair witch project a glorified snooze fest of a horror film never have i ever zoned out of a film as much as i have with this one it has an interesting setting and does manage to set up its plot effectively but it ultimately falls flat on its face as soon as our protagonists finish introducing themselves and their purpose the last 80 of the film is either banter arguing about getting lost or very short night sequences that do not invoke fear i wouldve even welcomed a cheap jump scare to get me back into the film but nothing the points of conflict between protagonists were next to pointless and more comedic if anything as a matter of fact this film made me laugh more than it did scare me the ending to this film was arguably the most disappointing and unsatisfying part     my iq level actually might have dropped after this film which is actually a good thing why i was watching it with a female i really liked and it seemed to have also lowered her iq by the end of the film we were so zoned out bored and confused that our primitive instincts took over our bodies and we began to engage in sexual activity it occurred to me that this film actually increases the chances of a sexual encounter    the final verdict of this film as a film is 1 out of 5 stars    the final verdict of this film to get it in is 6 out of 5 stars    use this film responsibly
Nov 5 2016,positive,creepy defiantly worth a gander
Nov 1 2016,negative,interesting plot and story horrible production
Oct 30 2016,positive,very suspenseful and ominous gives an increasingly present feeling of insanity
Oct 29 2016,positive,relying on suspense and psychological tension rather than onscreen action to deliver the chills the blair witch project makes effective use of its sinister setting shaky camerawork and suggestive sound effects for a nervewracking campfire story  and kicked off horrors unprecedented run of foundfootage pictures in the bargain
Oct 25 2016,positive,i was expecting this to be just fine and boy i loved it
Oct 23 2016,negative,wait what happened somebody hold the damn camera still
Oct 22 2016,positive,not many people seem to realize that this was the first found footage film ever and that it was basically as improvised as a feature film could get very original and provides feelings of tense mystery
Oct 14 2016,positive,this is still the only film i have ever seen that frightened me enough to have trouble sleeping the first time i saw it to me the power of ones own imagination far outweighs the usual cinematic translation of horror into buckets of blood and guts
Oct 11 2016,negative,finally saw the movie and was disappointing probably was good at the time because of the new concept of found footage movie
Sep 30 2016,positive,this film terrified me when i was younger i believe it is the ultimate conclusion to what spielberg tried to do with jaws what we imagine will be scarier than what they can show us that being said its not for everyone less scares and more an overwhelming sense of dread
Sep 27 2016,positive,since i didnt see it when it first came out i think that that is the reason that i wasnt all that into the film the beginning starts very promising and when the characters get in the woods it feels like its really going strong but then it just keeps going and going the end of the film is good but its not worth sitting through all of the runtime to get to
Sep 23 2016,neutral,deemed a classic but quite frankly repetitive and boring from time to time awful ending as well
Sep 22 2016,positive,it may take a while but this movie is actually really scary if you have the patience to watch teens argue for an hour
Sep 20 2016,positive,pretty good i have absolutely no idea what it was about but it was good
Sep 20 2016,positive,the blair witch project is the directorial and writing debut of daniel myrick and eduardo s√°nchez and it stars heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard in a foundfootage horror film about three film students that wanted to do a documentary about the blair witch and when they went to the forest where the blair witch takes place at they ended up getting lost and wanting to get back home after seeing blair witch it definitely felt like the right time for me to watch the first film that started the foundfootage genre even if it wasnt the first movie to do so the way that it settles the film up from interviewers you wouldnt even know which of them are actors and those who are not it made sense about why all the stuff are being filmed as the characters are film students and wanted to film everything i find the characters a bit more developed than the characters from blair witch and you would find them more developed if you go to the website for the movie itself as it gives a lot of backstories to the characters that makes them feel more human that makes sense why people at the time thought that they were actually missing since when you find out that it was mostly improvised its really impressive to see the actors just to make some conversations in their mind because it makes it seem more genuine which doesnt feel like the film was scripted i didnt find the movie annoying as it makes sense for their situation of being lost in the woods although i understand if viewers thought the opposite and it had a lot of creepy moments in the movie i do like that it didnt show you what it was and it makes the actors very tired which makes it interesting to know that the directors are messing around with the actors in terms of where they want to go and what limited food they have i understand why people say that this is the scariest film of all time when youre out in the perspective of where the actors are going in the forest where its pitch black and theres someone whos watching them but i didnt find it scary at all just immensely creepy its crazy that with a low budgeted film like this can create something that people still talk about to this day whether they love it or hate it and as for me i really enjoyed it
Sep 19 2016,positive,the blair witch project is a slow building tense film that does a great job at creating a simple plot that some how manages to captivate you and terrify you at the same time
Sep 18 2016,positive,if they had chopped out some of the inane improvisationconstant bickering and just picked one damn character to lose their shit so scenes actually flowed into one another itd been a masterpiece as it stands though its still pretty damn spooky
Sep 18 2016,positive,doesnt stand the test of time but was great in its day saw this in the theater while in college multiple times original unique and scary without much happening
Sep 18 2016,negative,i wont deny this movie was revolutionary for the horror genre but that doesnt stop it from being awful trash
Sep 18 2016,positive,movie night with iris    ok so my savvy daughter wasnt spooked i still bleedin was even though camcorders seem from a bygone age this film is still truly groundbreaking it ramps up the tension and paranoia to unbearable levels
Sep 17 2016,positive,a suspencful creepy movie the most sudden of things is what you fear in this movie not knowing what the blair witch even looks like youll still be very impressed on how they can keep you on the edge of your seat
Sep 17 2016,negative,the only thing i can say about this film is it shouldnt take until the final 10 seconds to have something interesting happen it is otherwise completely boring
Sep 16 2016,positive,one of my top twenty fav horror movies of all time
Sep 16 2016,neutral,really fail to see the hype here found footage films are typically never my cup of tea its all over the place emotionally one moment youre engaged with a few cliche laughs and youre then puzzled sad sort of scared puzzled some more and then confused on what to feel i thought the acting was great though i thought the three actors did a great job convincing me that this was real life found footage but it was just lacking
Sep 15 2016,negative,sucked period not scary at all
Sep 13 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ever made andor released to say it was boring is understating the painfully obvious
Sep 13 2016,negative,this was boring as hell i have no idea how it got such a high rating
Sep 12 2016,positive,the blair witch project is an unique horror film that for better of for worse started one of the biggest trends in horror found footage it builds up tension and has a decent payoff to make up for some notsoscary moments though out the film its still a mustsee for anyone that calls themselves a horror fan because it revolutionized the genre for many years to come
Sep 12 2016,positive,awesome excited for the new one
Sep 7 2016,negative,boring nothing happened
Sep 7 2016,positive,lets face it the blair witch project is not a horror movie it isnt all that scary but the story itself is compelling enough
Sep 6 2016,positive,interesting and very entertaining at the same time hope blair witch 2016 will be very good
Sep 6 2016,positive,455  still chilling and holds up pretty well  very innovative for its time and still superior than the vast majority of found footage films  the blair witch project shows that sometimes less is more
Sep 5 2016,positive,i know this film was groundbreaking for the time and that it opened the door for an entire new subgenre that being said i was amazed at how little actually happened its surprising that people actually found this film scary
Sep 3 2016,positive,the blair witch project is one of my favourite films of all time it is dripping with atmosphere and realism a lot of this is conveyed by the awesome performances given by the three leads full review coming soon
Sep 2 2016,positive,though heather donahues performance was at some points frustrating and seemed forced there is no denying that the blair witch project delivers first class scares without the need of blood gore or a physical fiend
Aug 31 2016,positive,scariest movie ever i couldnt sleep for a week
Aug 29 2016,positive,the movie had a interesting woods who had a extend intectually ran where blair witch was exscuted for real l think it pretty less scary than other non movie
Aug 28 2016,positive,blair witch taps into the irrational fears you had as a kid and then makes you feel like not only were they real but that they are merciless and implacable it leaves you with your nerves shredded and raw and i for one have never been able to make it through a second viewing
Aug 26 2016,positive,i really dont understand why a lot of people dont like this film i thought it was a very solid horror film
Aug 25 2016,positive,the blair witch project started a phenomenon on a level compared to what jaws did for the ocean    a group of teenagers hike into the woods in search of the blair witch with the goal of making a documentary through a few nights of terror the group will slowly start to stumble onto the legend that is the blair witch sadly a year later their equipment was found and the footage was released for the entire world to see     this is the film that started the found footage genre it was only two decades ago that found footage movies were basically non existent and when this film was released it sent major ripples through cinema was it real was this the most terrifying film of the year when i bought this film i wasnt expecting much but going back and watching this so called phenomenon i was actually fairly impressed     one thing this movie does great is the use of the blair witch they use the beginning of the film to build up the lore and myths around the witch and by the time the kids go into the woods your mind is able to wander off into almost anything not once in this film is the witch shown many people were upset about that and not once was anything shown in general all of the scares came from the reaction of the kids sounds and disturbing artifacts left around their tent the witch was used to create conflict and terror among the group while not being overused or shown if the witch was shown it probably wouldve decreased the value of the witch and if anything it helps let your mind think of just how scary and frightening the witch could look like    like i said this is where the found footage genre really started after this was made many creators ran out there to make their own found footage films in an attempt to replicate what this movie did with this movie being filmed in hi8 video and 16mm film it truly felt like found footage and it made the experience just that much more real    one thing i also really like among movies is character conflict i just love how this witch even though shes never seen manages to create this conflict and divide within the group i love how the group gets torn apart from the inside and throughout all the panic they cant help but lose themselves in all the madness its a very well done psychological conflict and it adds a lot of layers to the movie    in the end i do recommend this film to horror enthusiasts especially those in love with the found footage genre this is a well made found footage movie that im happy to have in my collection
Aug 25 2016,positive,one of the most suspenseful and intense horror films of all time and of the few films to do the found footage genre right ive heard a lot of people call this film boring and lacking in substance but those were also the people that found 2001 slow and pretentious and grave encounters a horror masterpiece in my opinion the slow and meticulous story telling allows for atmosphere and suspense to flourish when on the rare occasion something does happen of consequence its all the more impactful because of how it was built up i found the ending traditionally scary and even kind of intelligent when compared to a lot of other low budget independent horror films or even just films in general  it has setup and a payoff something filmmakers even today should learn to incorporate as it works more times than it fails although simple in its execution the result is no less horrifying and worth while it leaves a lot up to the imagination but not as so far as to restrict anything we should be seeing leaving us with a film that sticks with you long after seeing it   a very solid 810
Aug 23 2016,negative,finally got around to seeing this  should have kept waiting almost unwatchable maybe because the found footage thing was a somewhat new concept in 99 critics thought this was innovative and brilliant but it is tedious boring and poorly acted and the three characters must rank among the least likable and dumbest in cinematic history
Aug 19 2016,negative,the unscariest scary movie ever 90 minutes of tension free tedium all hype and no delivery awful
Aug 17 2016,negative,if you want a scary horror movie that is filled with suspense and good scares watch another movie because this one is so boring the characters are unlikeble the story is pretty bad and the shots just showing the actors face are just disgusting with boogers all over them     if you are having trouble sleeping just watch this movie
Aug 7 2016,negative,tons of people loved this movie but i never saw why i mean it was okay but it bored me to death maybe its just not my kind of movie
Jul 27 2016,positive,the film may not be a horror for say but its an incredibly natural convincing and truely unsettling film   grade b
Jul 26 2016,positive,quite possibly one of the best and innovative horror films in history from its incredible marketing campaign spooky feeling and audience reaction if your are a fan of horror this is definitely a must this film has such an intricate backstory that spans numerous documentaries a sequel and 3 video games this film is eerily real it will keep you in suspense the whole way through
Jul 26 2016,positive,scared the hell outta me i got a total wicked vibe from this film
Jul 26 2016,positive,the blair witch project is a wellexecuted unorthodox horror movie though it has the strong potential to bore viewers out due to its slowburn trait treatment even so all that melts away when the film reaches its wings and soar over an eerie unsettling transition of events in which will the dreadfully illfated characters will be facing up with    instead of giving a usually predictable horror movie element it more relies on the realism approach that binds with the audiences imagination  that gives out a conclusion to a certain situation hence would potentially adds up more tension buildups to the story the blair witch project is not for everyone due to its unorthodox found footage aesthetics yet also not for the faint of hearts
Jul 24 2016,positive,7510  had to revisit this movie after the news that the sequel blair witch is coming out in a few weeks and although the movie hasnt aged that well it still is pretty creepy and a cult classic of horror found footage   july 23 2016
Jul 23 2016,positive,one of the greatest horror movies ever created  it brought the found footage subgenre to the mainstream and changed film marketing forever  the lore around it was great  the tension was built up well and the final scene was memorable
Jul 20 2016,positive,sometimes the things you dont see are the most scariest
Jul 20 2016,positive,scary enough but not quite as scary as one would hope
Jul 17 2016,positive,no apologies given for my 5star review this movie scared me
Jul 12 2016,positive,a brilliant atmospheric and nervewracking horror film
Jul 12 2016,positive,the blair witch project is about some college students who go into the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the blair witch but soon realize that maybe the witch is real this film is a prime example of you fear what you cant see it has lost a little bit of its effect over time because of the great number of found footage films made since then
Jul 11 2016,negative,does not get better with age
Jul 7 2016,positive,not scary because i watched it in the day with friends intriguing story better on paper ending sticks with you
Jun 25 2016,negative,this has to be the most overrated horror movie i have ever seen the characters are annoying the whole movie is just them walking around the forest fighting with each other throughout the majority of the movie last but not least the movie is not scary     spoilers  there is no witch in the movie
Jun 22 2016,positive,i wish that whatever evil thing they were running from actually did come up in the movie
Jun 22 2016,neutral,the film that made found footage films popular this is one of the most successful independent films of all time the craziest part you wait around and wait around to see what is going to happen and really nothing does happen it is suspenseful if you a havent seen it before b give it your full attention c watch it alone or with one other person and d watch it in the blind dark if these all are not fulfilled you wont get the full experience and you might as well watch something else film is effective for what it is a found footage film
Jun 20 2016,negative,if you think people  yelling names in the woods is scarywell this is the movie for you
Jun 15 2016,positive,as of this writing this movie is about to celebrate the 17th anniversary of when it first terrified audiences at the sundance film festival on july 30th 1999 when the film was released in theaters to the public at large it arrived with some serious hype generated by the internet in an age before blairwitchproject could trend on facebook twitter even myspace and audiences around the world turned this tightly budgeted lowfi film into a box office smash and for awhile truly believed in the blair witch legend and that the three main actors had disappeared mysteriously and were never heard from again save for the found footage left behind nowadays theres 5 new found footage films coming out every week ranging from great to good to forgettably terrible to terribly forgettable but when this movie made on a 60000 budget by two aspiring filmmakers from florida first came out it was the first of its kind it set the bar high for not just found footage films but horror films in general the plot the actors the filming the im so sorry scene the finaleits all been talked about studied dissected and pondered about for 17 years and will be until the end of time it holds up and is glorious undeniable proof that great horror is timeless and gives you a reason to sleep with the lights on
Jun 11 2016,negative,i wanna really avoid any cheese    sorry no such luck easily the most overrated horror film of all time although one scene in a tent when the female lead is filming herself scared perfectly describes the movie a whole lot of snot
May 18 2016,positive,when i first saw the blair witch project i thought it was going to be just another amalgam of jump scares and cheaper techniques thank goodness it isnt though it allows you to think how the villain looks like and why is she so creepy maybe this isnt the 8th wonder of the world but i give it a big yes
May 14 2016,positive,i found it to be good  horror is far from being my favorite genre but it is up near the top of it anyway  relatively effective creepiness and convincing fear  71 out of 10
Apr 30 2016,positive,the blair witch project was a low budget film strong enough to send chills down your spine relatively better than a horror film up to date
Apr 11 2016,positive,despite its low budget the blair witch project is groundbreaking for 3 reasons  1  it launched the handicam cinematic device  2  it launched the found footage cinematic device and  3  it launched the mockuhistory backstory internet marketing device    the bwp started the handcam revolution adopted by many films to follow including cloverfield 2008  many complaints upon its release were about viewers throwing up at the theatres due to the jagged camera action  in fact a person 2 rows behind me threw up  i though cloverfields jagged camera work was much more pronounced     the bwp also started the found footage device copied by cloverfield and trollhunter 2010 amongst others  this film truly trailblazed a genre of cinema with a low budget and is wholly underrated     the handicam found footage and internet marketing cinematic devices used in cloverfield are a direct ripoff of the bwp  this earlier lowbudget film is vastly underrated especially because it trailblazed a path for highbudget films like cloverfield which are largely unoriginal in comparison  cloverfield also stole the bwps internet mockuhistory backstory marketing device    bwp is a simple low budget film that was expertly shot to invoke terror suspense and horror in the viewer by what happens offscreen rather than on the screen  often this storytelling device is much more effective than the blood and gore that so many modern viewers have become accustomed to    i watched this on the big screen when it was originally released  the film made me think about its events long after i viewed it  it does not nearly have the same effect watching it on tv or video especially with a number of chatty viewers  it is a psychological thriller that needs to be absorbed in isolation by the viewer for full effect    the website and mockuhistory of the witch was also groundbreaking in its day adding to the hype    audiences typically attracted to horror films especially teens have become immune by the saturation of blood and gore in hollywood thrasher flicks that they have largely forgotten how to think and become absorbed into a story  they will need to be tolerant of how the bwp is trying to convey its story  i can see that this same mass crowd would not appreciate this film and attribute a poor rating
Apr 10 2016,negative,horrible movie nothing even remotely scary about it
Mar 30 2016,positive,the birth of found footage films
Mar 30 2016,positive,honestly disgusted by the 55 approval rating from audiences this movie was raw creative and bonechilling one of the greatest examples of imagination is the most potent fear ever
Mar 23 2016,positive,455 the king of found footage films possibly
Mar 11 2016,positive,probably one of the best if not the best of the found footage genre is the one that started it all the blair witch project is an affecting film filled with atmosphere and mystery the cast of unknown actors turn in surprisingly believable performances you can actually feel their fear besides for the weak and intentionally unclear ending the blair witch project is a great film
Feb 26 2016,positive,a wellmade and planned signature film of the found footage subgenre tbwp raises many questions of realism mixing it with concerns of photography and challenging the very essence of cinematic space and how emotions atmosphere and content get delivered to its audiences
Feb 25 2016,neutral,its not scary as in make you jump but its still pretty scary in a different way
Feb 25 2016,positive,73  saw this on 25216  its well acted and the film effectively captures the paranoia and psychological tension that its characters experience but in the last 20 minutes the film loses mostly all of its steam and provides a half hearted attempt the film is also made so poorly that no one sane enough can like the chaotic cinematography that pauses too often
Feb 13 2016,positive,one of the smartest and most frightening horror films the blair witch project takes found footage style camera work and sends chills down our spines  even if nothing is onscreen
Jan 17 2016,negative,if you enjoy movies about whiney teenagers in a whiney forest while doing a whiney documentary about the whiney blair witch then screaming at each other because they lost a whiney map then this is the movie for you    ps the only thing i liked about this film was that some people decided to make one of the lowest budget horror movies and made it a classic impressive not talking to the script writer
Jan 9 2016,positive,beware of the great enemy fear of the unknown or rather fear of nothing but seriously i dont get the backlash on the audience score this is constructed well enough because it got me curious till the end foreshadowing until there was nothing and that was the plot twist for myself it had 2 deep things in it one obvious line that josh mentions and the other thing is that we hype these things for ourselves that we create the illusion of fear i loved it beautiful
Jan 7 2016,neutral,i feel that this movie is very very overrated i understand that it pirated the found footage genre and people thought it was real but i still think the film wasnt as good as ive been told i saw this movie when i was 10 and i thought it wasnt scary at all a 10 year old is usually scared by anything this film is very overrated and average at best has great acting but what the fuck did people find so scary about this movie
Jan 5 2016,negative,a group of people are lost in the woods they wonder around the woods filming themselves being lost one of the women constantly and annoyingly screams and cries into they camera because they are lost as if this will in some way aid their situation at the end of the film they find a derelict building in the woods they have a look around go upstairs and when they come downstairs one of them is stood in the corner having a wee film ends    this is a classic case of one critic describing a film as scary and the rest of them not having the bottle to put him right they didnt get it either but they were so scared of being ridiculed they all decided to follow his lead and describe it as scary it isnt its shit you have to pay full price to see a picture that only takes up half the cinema screen its only lasts just over an hour and its about as scary as a warm teabag this is the only time coming out of a cinema i have ever felt like asking for my money back
Jan 4 2016,negative,while it may have been one of the earliest examples of foundfootage film this horror film failed to thoroughly establish an interesting story and was a bland addition to the genre
Dec 31 2015,positive,overall probably my favourite found footage horror movie at times it can be a little creep but fails to deliver extremely scary sequence and feels to short
Dec 30 2015,positive,not as scary as most people say it is however it is one of the better found footage movies out there obviously cause it was the original
Dec 26 2015,positive,the reason i found this film to be scary was due to the realism behind it   this move is psychologically scary because you have to become the character of the movie and put yourself in that situation not literally to realize how scary it actually is imagine being lost in never ending woods and being tormented by an unknown spirit  creature  being  wanderer terrifying and whats even better this movie clearly influenced half of the self filmed paranormal movies of the later 21st century
Dec 24 2015,positive,the blair witch project might be one of the most unique movies ever the sense of dread is palpable after about the first 40 minutes the movie is sort of dependent on the audience making themselves scared they never show the blair witch but there is enough evidence to suggest that it exists the acting is superb it feels like they are actually convinced that this witch exists too the grainy camera footage really helps make this movie feel like it actually happened and not like these kids were carrying around some really expensive equipment around the ending is really disturbing and gut wrenchingly frightening if you havent seen many horror movies this is a great one to see if you have it might seem a little repetive but can still be appreciated for its creepy atmosphere its a cantmiss movie plain and simple
Dec 17 2015,positive,horror is just one of those genres that gets a pretty bad wrap some days and its not hard to see why cruddy remakes poor acting and sometimes they just feel so unreal they are horrible sometimes though horrors come along that not only satisfy those looking for a fright but also those who watch all kind of films the blair witch project is exactly that of course it was applauded when it first came out for its new take on horror using the handheld camera and also that it felt much more human than most horror movies that came out in the 90s its all about a legend that some kind of thing lives in the woods near burkitsville formerly blair in maryland a trio of students go to search the woods to make a documentary on the legend and well there footage was found a year later and the students have vanished    the film is quite fantastic in the way it sets itself up it doesnt try to jump into the end too fast and even with an 81 minute run time it never goes too quick the plot is well crafted as well and the way in which it jumps between shots is good for the story to move along well and nicely it can have its periods where you might get frustrated at the pace but in general nearly overall it is timed well of course it isnt hard to get handheld movies like this done on such a low budget and you cant expect much from this in terms of spectacular things but my word does it not need much of a budget the creepy feel the people behind this give is spine tingling never revealing anything properly and always the film uses the dark to great effect    the people behind this are daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez who direct and write this and do a fine job sure everyone especially when it came out heralded the handheld camera which is great but also these two get things like sound colour and just generally the whole feel of the movie is spot on myrick and sanchez create a script that has some nice dialogue too its the kind of dialogue that most horror movies need the stuff that actually sounds normal and not cheesy or lines that are way over dramatic the cast are pretty solid too and of course being unknown it has the element of realism in there of course after leaving the town and heading to the woods you only really see these three characters so the people playing them had to be picked just right and they are they are likable and at the same time can be unlikeable and that really shows how the characters change as the plot goes along     the blair witch project isnt something i think all horror fans will like with its handheld feel and not a lot of horror thats right in your face but it works mostly in its way that is leaves you quite literally in the dark at times its spooky and there arent many more words to describe this movie than that even when things going on arent necessarily creepy you still look around those woods as if something will come out at any moment in fact watching this i even got to looking into the woods from the very first second they step foot in them as if expecting some sort of weird thing to come out any second but if you havent seen this you will see what happens
Dec 15 2015,positive,as a movie not great as a filming process super original
Dec 8 2015,neutral,blair witch was absolutely terrifying when it first hit theatres dont act like you did not get caught up in the hype at the time that it came out  it is easy to look back now in a blood soaked corny gore fest that the horror genre has become and say this movie has no substance and relies on gimmicks to scare you  that was the whole point  nothing like this was ever seen before in a movie  filmed like a home movie this movie feels all too real which is what makes it absolutely frightening throw in the fact that the entire story may have been true and audiences were terrified all over the world   sometimes there is nothing on the screen just darkness and whispering that where blair witch project shines the brightest though  the tension in this film is ridiculous  build up through the entire movie  it does not rely on making you jump out of your seat and scream but you certainly will feel uneasy in your seat watching it peering out the window making sure nothing is out there looking at you  this is a movie that makes you a little nervous to get up in the dark and walk down the hallway to the bathroom in the middle of the night  i would never spoil the ending to any movie but just know it is all worth it at the end
Nov 22 2015,negative,boring and uneventful
Nov 9 2015,negative,about as scary as my left toenail total waste of time
Nov 7 2015,negative,this movie isnt scary in the least bit and its shaky camerawork unoriginality and lazy writing are just some of the things that make it one of my least favorite movies of all time
Nov 1 2015,negative,how it was made is neat in and of itself though not very effective  im theorizing the reason why people find it so scary is that the girls breathing and screaming being audible and so close to the camera almost the entire time is making them feel that they should be scared  well i found it obnoxious  the shakiness and bad quality of the movie may only slightly enhance the edginess of the woods these children are wandering in but even then it doesnt feel scary at all  nothing is inherently threatening other than the kids incredible stupidity that eventually got them lost  the ending fell so flat and hard that it went through the floor  leaving things up to ambiguity is a clever thing to do in horror movies because i do believe less is more but there needs to be something more instead of little more than nothing
Nov 1 2015,positive,a low grade camera some trees and some noises all it takes to scare the shit out of you it seems the blair witch project is stripped down to pure raw immediate terror no special effects no music and not a single glimpse of any monsters spooks or ghouls at all the fact that you dont see anything fantastical is what gives this movie its outright realness it feels like its happening it looks plausible the only question is do you have the imagination to let its power take hold
Oct 27 2015,positive,not super scary but definitely creepy as someone who is scared of getting left behind this film definitely creepped me out
Oct 26 2015,negative,the only time i have ever left a movie pissed off that i wasted  on that garbage
Oct 22 2015,negative,crap awful boring just avoid
Oct 17 2015,positive,to me this film defines a modern day horror classic sadly the found footage genre has been beat to death since 1999 and the terrible sequel to this film has tainted the legacy this is really bias as i love the film dearly so its eight missing filmmakers out of ten
Oct 16 2015,positive,while the legacy of this film has created a swarm of mediocre found footage movies this is undoubtedly one of the most original horror movies of the 1990s focusing more on the anxiety arising from being lost rather than jump scares leaving ambiguity for the audience to work with and utilizing a completely original brand of anticinematic conventions
Oct 16 2015,positive,the most intense ending of any horror film
Oct 16 2015,positive,disturbing ass found footage film man  the blair witch project is at the same time good and bad its an entire found footage movie and there is almost no gore but a lot of scares if psychological scares were proven to be more effective than buckets of gore this would really be the one the acting is excellent for a low budget movie but one thing is for sure its pretty long and can sometimes even get boring
Oct 14 2015,positive,filled with atmosphere and incredibly strong performances the blair witch project still remains a chilling and strong entry in the horror genre
Oct 11 2015,negative,this movie is horrendous i was soooooooooooo bored the majority of the movie is them complaining about being lost and arguing with each other about whos fault it is there are extensively long scenes of complete darkness i get the idea of trying to create tension but im watching a motion picture without a picture for long portions of the movie the only thing good about this is how they made it with almost no budget and the actors having limited knowledge of the script but even with that i cant give it a one star there was almost nothing scary about this other than it barely being creepy       spoilers      there were literally only two scenes of something scary actually happening the first takes place about an hour into the movie and the second with 5 minutes left i cant believe i wasted an hour and twenty minutes for those two useless scenes and they never actually show anything no joke nothing 2 viewings
Oct 8 2015,negative,2015 and its still dumb
Oct 6 2015,negative,the atmosphere is great and utterly chilling but other wise all i can here is the characters argueing for the entire film and the shaking gives me motion sickiness youd have to pay me to watch this again
Oct 1 2015,negative,nothing happens nothing
Sep 26 2015,positive,a practical film in the foundfootage and horror genre though with minor plot holes this film does keep you interested and engaged the whole way through
Sep 26 2015,positive,loved it it had me freaked out
Sep 21 2015,positive,occasionally creepy and unsettling but also unfulfilling towards the end
Sep 19 2015,positive,not as scary as i thought it would be but three stars for revolutionizing foundfootage films and leaving all the scares to your imagination
Sep 18 2015,positive,the only film that ever scared me and still does people who complain about the unlikable characters dont get it the premise that youre watching found footage is only reinforced by having characters that you just might find annoying if you found someone elses footage what are the chances that youd find the people endearing they were real genuine characters  how would you react in a forest in that situation youd probably be annoying to most people youd probably dribble snot in front of a camera when you are terrified to your core  your friend has been murdered and his tongue was a gift wrapped present and you are sure youll be killed before sunrise do people not realise that losing the map and getting lost they were doing circles was due to the witch do people know that it wasnt josh calling them from the forest that night  it was the witch imitating joshs screams when she tortured and murdered him the night before thats scary she was floating through the forest calling to them with joshs voice very scary film
Sep 14 2015,negative,i forgot to do this back in 1999
Sep 1 2015,positive,a cooltrippy mysteryhorror film thats cleverly constructed and makes you curious after every scene
Aug 19 2015,negative,the worst most boring movie ive ever seen the worst my farts are scarier and more engaging than this movie im foaming at the mouth just for having put myself through such a crock of elmers glue shit
Aug 18 2015,positive,i really dont like horror films so it isnt saying very much when i type that this movie terrified me however it was so eeriely filmed with expert suspense perhaps the most disturbing parts were not where the teenagers were screaming and running around in the dark it was they daytime where they were slowly going insane from fear the movie itself is creepier than it is outright horror and that was just as effective to scare me long after the credits rolled i found myself mulling over the events of the film creating theories to explain the unknown evil
Aug 11 2015,positive,the 1999 hit that put the found footage genre on the map  beyond the hype and controversy this is really backtobasics horror  imagination and sound  a chilling unnerving experience
Aug 2 2015,positive,despite getting a lot of bad press i always liked this film it still freaks me out 16 years later a psychological horror which leads you form empathy toward the characters questionable acting on occasions
Jul 26 2015,negative,not scary at all just a big waste of time
Jul 22 2015,positive,scared the shit out of me in the theater loved it
Jul 15 2015,positive,scary horror better than the devil inside
Jul 10 2015,negative,this movie bored me to death
Jul 1 2015,negative,not a good choice to watch if youre expecting to tremble in fear or any jump scares the only good thing about this film is the feeling of abandonment that the characters deal with
Jun 29 2015,negative,i only watched because of all the hype  and that its one of the scariest movies of all time really it was bit creepy but i was never scared it gave my friend a headache with how it was filmed ive definitely have seen better films
Jun 29 2015,positive,unsettling but gets the job done for delivering good scares
Jun 29 2015,positive,it wont satisfy your average gore hound  but if you put yourself in the shoes of the characters and you are able to truly able to respect the revolutionary technique and style of this horror classic it may just scare you out of your wit
Jun 12 2015,negative,possibly the most overrated movie of all time
Jun 9 2015,positive,if you pay attention to the details the blair witch project is without question a masterpiece of the horror genre sure the hype killed it for many viewers and its definitely a product of its time but terror is timeless theres something oddly beautiful about the raw footage and the trio of performances is never lacking in realism the creators give you just enough creepy stick men piles of rocks the snapping of twigs in the distance and lets your subconscious and imagination do all of the rest the result is unshakably disturbing unsettling and cathartic in its elemental power to scare the imitators are many but nothing beats the original
Jun 3 2015,neutral,you people thought this was scary
May 25 2015,positive,the great in this movie is in its simplicity  though it doesnt win it too much  besides being a groundbreaking movie for mock docs to come its an average movie
May 22 2015,positive,the grandfather of ff films uses atmosphere and dread more than out and out scaresbut theyre there toto create a memorable horror movie
May 20 2015,positive,its laughable but gamechanging
May 16 2015,negative,this is absolutely one of the worst movies of all time and it gained a cult following smh horrible overacting nothing ever significant happens in the movie the success of this movie was based on middle schoolers werent even supposed to see it due to its rating who imagined the movie to be true  even though it clearly said it wasnt in the credits at the end for all to see it capitalized on our modern culture full of people whove never ventured deep into the woods  much less at night people popularized this movie because of a lot of hype built by very small thinking none of the characters in the movie were unique because each of them had the same passiveaggressive personalities and each exploded into anxiety attacks at different times during this horrible flick its a suspense with out the thriller part it puts viewers into suspense and never delivers anything at all its a waste of time  one of the most worthless movies ever if i could give it a negative rating i would steer clear you cant get back the hour and twentyfour minutes youll lose watching it
Apr 13 2015,negative,my friend and i saw two of the more anticipated movies of 1999 on the same night eyes wide shut and blair witch project and i dont think i could have found two better examples of the opposite extremes of filmmaking blair witch for all its hype is disappointing and even insulting at times granted the core performances are convincing however much of what they do doesnt make any sense at all the films key distinction is essentially that it looks bad with lots of handjerky motions which only serve to make one dizzy there is little real story to the movie and suffice to say the movie feels improvised and off the cuff and subsequently amateurish the only fascinating aspect to this movie is how in the world it could have generated so much hype the theater i went to was a packed house while the ews was only half full both were goodsized theaters i honestly dont know how such a badlyfilmed inconsequential film could steal thunder from the genius of kubrick blair witch commits the worst crime for a horror film it doesnt scare it doesnt even tease us with a scare its just boring for all those critics who compared it with the exorcist i can only imagine they meant exorcist ii
Apr 11 2015,positive,very good and unique i was one of those who was fooled into believing it actually happened which says something
Apr 6 2015,positive,the blair witch project borrows from horror classics like fw murnaus nosferatu and michael powells peeping tom in rendering us helpless victims to an almost faceless entity and combines this sensation with the viscerality of roman polanskis repulsion  but this time we have left the apartment and ventured into the woods with nothing but a map a compass and a few bad words undoubtedly inspiring to all but sincerely not for everyone the film is more than a horror film as it is barren of all gimmick and a real trailblazer of the foundfootage genre the characters are so raw and believable that the audience almost feels unified with them in fleeing from something so frightening that it cant be felt or conquered just simply acknowledged i will always love this film
Mar 31 2015,positive,great as a first of a genre and very creepy and effective
Mar 26 2015,negative,the girl was sooooo annoying
Mar 24 2015,positive,dont go into blair witch thinking to see some giant cgi monster like in mama blair witch is about what you dont see and the movies tone atmosphere and pacing are perfect now yes it is a little slow but the performances from all the actors completely make up for it with the strong acting this movie would really be passable when the movie is about the people you need to buy the fact theyre really losing it its one of those movies you consider a mixed bag when its over but as you take a few days to think about it you like it more and more though i can only imagine watch this must have been like to watch in 1999 at that time found footage was all new and people had never seen a horror movie that felt this real its not for everyone but what it does well it really does well
Mar 14 2015,positive,a lot of people hate this film and a lot of people love it im one of the people who loves it personally i am a fan of the found footage genre and not very many are great however this is one of the great ones despite this films low budget it does deliver very affective scars and will leave you feeling uneasy after viewing it this film also may make a lot of people scared to camp in the woods so dont watch it if you live next to the woods but if you dont please watch and enjoy this horror classic
Mar 11 2015,negative,absolutely terrible
Mar 1 2015,neutral,still not sure whats scarier the blair witch or being stuck in the woods with these characters its a tough call
Feb 28 2015,positive,the king of found footage films was so iconic and started the found footage craze as much as the ending blew with how it just ended once you fully realize what the ending was it makes it rather rad
Feb 28 2015,positive,an inspired innovated milestone of its respective genres thats genuinely eerie and thrilling while blended in being compelling but it wasnt scary enough to scare me more than a little and when being rough and depressed with moments of overdoing it however its an overall good film it would sure frighten most viewers to the point of being more scared and more frightened than me b    full review coming soon
Jan 30 2015,negative,although i appreciate its influence on the genre i personally found it one of the most boring movies ive ever watched i fell asleep watching it the first time  so i watched it another timeand although i did not fall asleep it was actually more disappointing  the only part that was actually halfway decent was the last minute with the guy standing in the corner
Jan 8 2015,positive,while not the best horror movie ever made the blair witch project is still well worth the historical acclaim given to it its found footage done right and there isnt a dull moment to be found in the whole of it
Jan 7 2015,positive,vary scary√£√¢√£√¢    possibly one of he best horror films ever made the blair witch project actually gets into your head instead of using cheap jump scares which define most horror movies nowadays
Jan 6 2015,positive,one of the scariest films i have ever watched dont believe the negative reviews
Jan 3 2015,positive,surprisingly good and creepy i went in thinking this movie would be a joke but it is actually considerably creepy and it was cool to see them make a decent movie with such a low budget good ending too
Jan 3 2015,negative,most over rated piece of shite i have ever seen
Dec 31 2014,positive,stunning its a mature little horror flick that relies not on creepy visuals or jump scares but on the viewers imagination a film that relies on the fear of the unknown and its amazingly effective
Dec 24 2014,negative,dreadful    i was bored out of my mind for the first 30 minutes and one of the 3 people i went to see it with fell asleep beyond the first 30 minutes it just plodded along with little in the way of interest i was glad when it was over and i could leave the movie theater
Dec 23 2014,positive,original and imaginative the blair witch project proves that you scary movies can be made on very little budget  it also proves that imagination can be just as scary as actually seeing something  a wonderful mockumentary
Dec 19 2014,negative,went into this with great anticipation left with equally great disappointment  ive watched many a horror movie in my day and this was one of the worst i know some people appreciated the shaky camera and the alleged creeping suspense i wasnt one of those people im sorry if i dont find a bundle of sticks on the ground scary totally overrated
Dec 12 2014,negative,unbelievably boring
Dec 10 2014,positive,this movie is only good the first time you see it the mystery in what lies ahead each time the characters hear or see something truly gives you goosebumps unlike any movie
Dec 6 2014,positive,if you like situational horror this is a movie for you if you like jumpscares or visual gore horror i would skip this one otherwise i believe you will enjoy the movie
Dec 2 2014,positive,it may not be the scariest movie in the bunch but no other engulfed me with such strong feel of dread paranoia and hopelessness top notch idea flawless execution
Nov 30 2014,positive,perfection of the found footage genre
Nov 25 2014,negative,boring waste of time nothing we havent seen before lots of running and screaming at trees
Nov 13 2014,negative,the only reason this movie merits half a star is because i couldnt rate it any lower most overrated film of all time the found footage film that paved the way for so many more that were far better than this piece of trash
Nov 2 2014,positive,oddly what makes so many people hate the blair witch project the lack of any reveal and the constant frayedraw emotions from the cast are what i find to be its strongest assets a nightmarish odyssey that only disturbs me more as i think about it
Nov 1 2014,negative,very well done spooky creepy and suspenseful all the way through preparing you for an all out scare climax and then not providing it extremely disappointing and defeating the purpose of watching a horror film
Nov 1 2014,positive,though it shows age and has some wretched characters the blair witch project is a class example of a naturally scary movie with no cheap jumpscares or orchestra stings that lets the fear of the unknown do the work for it
Oct 31 2014,positive,although the gradually growing intensity and consistent found footage effect in this film is incredibly engaging its inability to provide the viewer with anything of substance leaves a bitter taste in the mouth as the tale abruptly comes to an end
Oct 31 2014,positive,the blair witch project is one of the most effective horror movies ever made and it is definitely not only one of my favorite horror movies but my number one favorite found footage movie i thought it works very effective to not include music throughout the majority of the movie which it does put you the right mood as you are watching it the three main actors work so well together to play an alternate version of themselves as if they were filmmakers the story itself is also very well told i know everyone hated this movie when they first saw it and were extremely disappointed that this movie is not real i know its not real but it didnt need to be real if it was then it would be ended up as snuff film and that is not good with that said i really enjoy this movie for what is and maybe for the haters of this movie might give it another chance so they can understand the movie better i highly recommend the blair witch project
Oct 31 2014,neutral,the blair witch project has intriguing premise that could have been used to a great effect but it unfortunately fails both to scare and entertain mainly because nothing really happens and endless swearing by the immensely irritating characters ruined the film for sure it may be groundbreaking but it essentially is just a gimmick that influenced countless bad movies
Oct 26 2014,positive,although that heatherbitch is so annoying you cant deny it was one ground breaking piece back then
Oct 24 2014,positive,the film requires no special effects no computer generated imagery just your imagination the blair witch project hinges on the idea that the human imagination can often conjure up the most intensely horrifying imagery possible and so what unravels is a film which identifies your primary concerns and fears and targets them relentlessly its a relatively short watch made everthemore potent by strong performances from heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard all of whom are entirely engrossed in the film they are shooting    its immensely simplistic the plot but that may be what makes it all the more effective it doesnt require subplots nor anything completely irrelevant from the current situation it is entirely centred around the characters their immediate plights and their conflictions all of which relate to the present circumstances they are within underappreciated by modern audiences perhaps due to the oversaturation of blatant copies attempted after its initial release the blair witch project is harrowing to young and old and it doesnt require anything too fancy or expensive to do it its simply brilliant writing brilliant direction brilliant performances and brilliant scares
Oct 24 2014,positive,at first i thought this would be a movie about arguing over the fucking map and being lost but became pretty decent at the end however i expected more
Oct 23 2014,positive,hard to review this one seeing that i watched it years after the found footage genre has hit mainstream the appeal of the movie is the supposed realism and freshness which is hard to appreciate seeing it so many years later still for what it is it is well made horror actors are believable the documentary process is meta enough and the story progresses naturally given the material its a shame the camera quality is so badi know its supposed to seem real and that the ending felt forced
Oct 19 2014,positive,watched this w a group of friends at 430am decades ago  hair raising experience at the time
Oct 19 2014,positive,spooky original as thrilling and chilling as the omen this hand shot foundfootage documentary style movie is a wonderful watch  with each of the previous methods of shooting doing its bit to increase the creepiness of the movie and the woods add to the whole thing  must watch
Oct 17 2014,positive,a frightening realistic and genuinely creepy found footage style horror movie that generates most of its scares with sound effects subtle implications of things and the actors who display terrified people
Oct 7 2014,positive,im afraid to close my eyes im afraid to open them
Oct 6 2014,positive,excellent pacing and an incredible exposition make this one of my favorite horror films the self awareness of this films tone and run time add to its enjoyment and creepiness the dialogue particularly in the beginning and the many screams also helps create a grounded feeling in a supernatural film i know isnt real
Oct 4 2014,positive,ive seen too many horror movies to be scared by this one i guess not seeing the witchghostmonster in a movie like this makes the movie scarier but at the very least show what the audience is supposed to be scared of for a brief moment otherwise if i dont see anything thats remotely scary and i keep guessing what it is then theres nothing to be scared of and it doesnt work
Oct 3 2014,negative,dear god i hate this movie i overall hate the genre it created in its wake save for two movies and i hate the acting the last 5 minutes of the film are intense i guess but where the importance of the blair witch project really comes into play is what it did for viral marketing admittedly the lead up to this when it first came out gave me nightmares its unfortunate that the movie had to come out and ruin all of that i guess you should watch it but only if you watch it with lowered expectations
Sep 30 2014,positive,innovative film that started the found footage movie craze  while having aged a bit and not being as effective if you know ahead of time this is a fake film this is one movie that truly benefits from the media surrounding particularly the excellent curse of the blair witch feature its still solid movie that shows how found footage should work  the actors give believable performances  the lowtech camera work gives a realistic feel  plus the lack of visual effects allows more to the imagination  overall while not as good a remembered still one of the best films of its genre
Sep 27 2014,positive,the blair witch project is a movie that scares viewers by not throwing things at the camera but instead creates a creepy atmosphere that only gets more intense the longer you watch its well acted well shot and well ahead of its time
Sep 25 2014,positive,take your paranormal activity movies and shove them up your arse
Sep 13 2014,positive,a really creepy and really good movie
Sep 7 2014,neutral,its admirably made but the blair witch project suffers from one too many anticlimactic moments
Sep 7 2014,negative,a better concept than film  the marketing campaign was genius and it invented the found footage genre  but the film by itself has not aged well
Sep 6 2014,negative,i had been wanting to see this movie since i was a child i finally watched it and now i wish i hadnt the beginning was okay but it just got worse and worse  however i liked the simplicity of the movie how it didnt have inane and constant jump scares like horror movies today have overall the characters were god awful and the acting was terrible and cringeworthy i would rather come face to face with the blair witch herself than listen to that chick scream and cry for another 80 minutes
Sep 4 2014,positive,at the time it was revolutionary but it isnt movie i could watch again
Sep 3 2014,negative,name of film blair witch project   director eduardo sanchez and daniel myrick   genre horror   rating 2   this movie was supposed to be like it was real they used handheld camcorders and like shaky blurry shots and what not it wasnt that scary     so there is this group of 3 two boys and one girls and they decide to go into the woods in maryland they were going out to see if the blair witch myth is legit they were on the first day and found piles of rocks which locals warned the witch was known for the first night was fine then on the second night they heard loud crashes in the woods but it was all around them which was impossible to be done by one person the next day while they were searching for another spot to camp the found sticks hanging from trees the sticks were shaped like humans that night they heard babies laughing and in the morning there were piles of rocks outside the tent they wanted to get out but kept going in circles     the third night there was someone outside the tent banging on it and screaming then one of the boys was gone no sight of him anywhere they hear screaming in the night and find bloody parts on meat wrapped in his shirt they go looking and something happens horrible     there is no message this movie was specifically made so people would be frightened by the witch they made it seem to be real with no credits at the end the director communicated the them by making it seem real     the films appearance was like a homemade movie and very shaky i like how it was very realistic and the blood was very real looking the light depended on   where they were and the time of day the sound was quet and there was no music     i did like the movie until the ending it was a very boring ending that made no sense i wish they would have described the wiches apperance and more about her but it was creepy throughout the movie overall it was   ok i would recommend it for grown ups for the gore and the language    lb 8th grade student
Sep 2 2014,negative,possibly the worst film i have ever seen and thats including batman  robin nothing happens in this film at all just people walking around a forest it says horror but should in fact say snoozefest as all i wanted to do was sleep
Aug 31 2014,negative,well talk about a film thats about as scary as leprechaun not only is the ending a let down but its just boring
Aug 26 2014,positive,itd be easy to mock the cheesy premise with the camera and the lost in the woods plot butbut every horror buff ive met and every review on this site claims to want everything thats in this movie in there horror movies its all here and its suspenseful thrilling and tense    and i loved every second of it    its the inevitability of it that i love most no matter where they go theyre drawn to the conclusion no map or compass can save them
Aug 25 2014,positive,the blair witch project has been and remains to be my favorite horror movie of all time it is an atmospheric web of suspense and creeping fear and though its rewatch value decreases steadily with each subsequent viewing i will never forget my reaction after completing the film for the first time   the three actors featured in the film are outstanding as they each appear genuinely frightened of their fate to come and the building terror is a fascinating experience all the way until the final shriek and drop of the camera
Aug 23 2014,positive,this film is terrifying due to the sheer insanity depicted by its three main characters as they find themselves lost in the woods with a quickly depleting sense of survival add to the mix the haunting idea of an ancient witch bloodlessly on their pursuit and you have one of the most riveting and aggressive portraits of modern horror yet conceived it is the mother of the found footage style of horror filmmaking yet so many of its predecessors struggle to find the crucial element that made this so successful the fact that less is more and it is our own fears and expectations that scare us more than anything else
Aug 19 2014,negative,couldnt even scare a 2 year old
Aug 16 2014,negative,creepy in the end but just crap
Aug 13 2014,positive,like cat people one of the most critically acclaimed horror movies the blair witch project knows that what is scariest is not what you see but what you dont like cloverfield a film following in blairs footsteps it understand that realism in character equates to relatability thus you have performances that make you second guess how scripted the film is and like another excellent horror film texas chainsaw massacre blair witch leaves you in constant painful anticipation leaving your mind to gradually swim into and accept more and more fantastical ideas in a bleak pool of insanity which culminates in a climax which exhibits a visualization of insanity and isolation
Aug 12 2014,negative,can be entertainingbut super fucking annoying and boring at times it was this movie that started the super annoying and fucking shit film making technique
Aug 9 2014,positive,this movie does not get enough praise nowadays the movie was brilliantly thought through when it first came out it was portrayed as if it were real footage having missing posters a website even news broadcasts to have the world believe it was real footage the two camera effect was very creepy and when it first came out many movies were not filmed that way the actors do great at portraying people who get stuck in the woods one of the most terrifying movies i have ever seen the simplicity of it is so beautiful even though theres no blood and guts the terror is real because its so realistic in my top 3 for sure and im a horror movie fanatic
Aug 9 2014,positive,this movie isnt about the blair witch or even really about horror its about how we unwind when put in increasingly stressful situations this couldnt have been done without a crew of amateurs eliciting downright raw emotional anxiety from both themselves and the viewers  the this is a true story bits might been a bit unnecessary but as a film its still incredibly stressful and quite horrifying
Aug 9 2014,positive,this movie isnt about the blair witch or even really about horror its about how we unwind when put in increasingly stressful situations this couldnt have been done without a crew of amateurs eliciting downright raw emotional anxiety from both themselves and the viewers  the this is a true story bits might been a bit unnecessary but as a film its still incredibly stressful and quite horrifying
Aug 9 2014,negative,as much as i disprove of giving this movie 1 star i feel it at least should get something for trying i walked into this movie after years of friends and family suggesting it as more frightening than anything youve seen and walked out believing they were all comic genuises blair witch is basically the equivalent of an hour and a half documentary of what the woods look like at night filmed by a group of emotionally fragile tour guides it wasnt until the last several minutes that i felt the mood start shifting from desperate to keep me watching to something actually frightening is coming but even then the film manages to disappoint with an ending that completely serves no purpose other than to make you feel the absolute tiniest of shivers up your spine overall if theres absolutely no other option available than to watch this movie lets hope you can withstand it but if there are other options out there please avoid watching this film for your own good acr avoidable disapproved
Aug 8 2014,positive,hated it the first time loved it the second manages to be genuinely effective without really revealing anything about whats happening the found footage thing is a good idea and they did it really well but i cant help but blame them for introducing it because now thats the only way horror ever seems to be shot eugh
Aug 8 2014,negative,what some call the best found footage movie ever made i call an overrated boring pointless movie with no good payoff also it spawned the paranormal activity movies and a bunch of other bad found footage movies
Aug 3 2014,positive,with all the expensive looking foundfootage films around today including cloverfield the paranormal activity franchise and rec perhaps this fairly quiet uneventful little film about three student filmmakers wandering through the woods will seem quite tame but while the others use visuals jumpscare tactics and inyourface villains blair witch has perhaps the most masterful crafting of tension in any horror film ever made owing to its realistic performances and structure and the subtlety of its supernatural moments
Aug 1 2014,negative,if i could it zero i would
Jul 30 2014,negative,this movie is so stupid theres a logical reason for every thing that happens to them omfg this movie is retarded if i could give it zero stars then i would
Jul 30 2014,positive,its folklore urban legend a tried and true method of scaring the sleep out of people
Jul 29 2014,negative,i can appreciate it as a moneymaking venture which it excelled at but everything about it was cloying and didnt come anywhere near being scary
Jul 29 2014,negative,the consensus says it all you have to use your imagination on what the hell is terrorizing a group of film makers whos making a documentary on this thing called the blair witch it supposedly haunts the hills of a small massachusetts townand trust me when i say this its fucking stupid im usually scared when it comes to this stuff because of extremely afraid of the paranormal deathly afraid almost and this had a demotic feel to it ive pushing this off because frankly i hear it sucksand damn were those people right i cant i wasnt scared at parts because that would be a lie its actually freaky in the middle part because of the unknown its like paranormal activity we are given little tidbits of scary things and eventually they get worse this is nothing new except its the first of its kind unlike pa this ends in the most idiotic way its like the directors were too cheap to show what was terrifying them we are only given auto and the auto is freighting but not when theres nothing to back up the voice the ending also ends with the witch screaming and then all of a student we see one of the characters staring at a wallthe camera falls and nothing stupid as shot and the ending of a movie really shows the strength of a filmand this falls flat on its ass overall this movie is laughable at parts very emotional with some sense of greatness but falls too flat at the end to care  24
Jul 28 2014,positive,the movie that kicked off the found footage genre is suspenseful and the best of the series
Jul 18 2014,positive,not quite sure how to feel about this film the characters are annoying and very unlikable for the majority of the film the movie itself is not as frightening as it may have once been when people were unsure of whether or not this film was real or not real based on the extraordinary performances given by these actors and the found footage however this movie can be quite unnerving especially in this films third act but most of the films scares come mostly from sounds such as laughing children or other odd and peculiar sounds overall this film benefits from its great performances and unsettling vibe but the film can also be quite slow at times and given that you never see the witch herself you cant help but feel a little disappointed
Jul 18 2014,positive,still the creepiest movie ive seen best horror films ive seen
Jul 15 2014,negative,while the movie starts off good and has a worthy build up the conclusion ends up falling flat and leaving audience members unsatisfied
Jul 13 2014,positive,brilliant flawless guerillastyle filmmaking proof that tension and suspense are much more important directorial tools than plastering the screen with gore and nudity which most contemporary horror movies think necessary a strong sense of atmosphere is the greatest tool in a horror filmmakers arsenal and this psychological masterpiece definitely has it down what an incredible film
Jul 12 2014,neutral,way better than willow creek thats for sure
Jul 3 2014,positive,i saw this movie for the first time a decade ago i decided to watch it again after many years and my expectations were only increased since unfortunately didnt the movie live up to the expectations the story wasnt as frightening as i hoped and the ending felt very anticlimatic but its still creepy as fk and its still much better than recent horror movies    watch it if you like  paranormal activity the fog 1980 the grudge
Jul 2 2014,neutral,a very boring horror film with very predictable scares
Jun 30 2014,positive,good horror films are difficult to come by yet some manage to stand the test of time while also acting as sort of a revolutionary step for the genre that is the blair witch project though its filming can be a little nauseating at times and the ending could be a hit or miss to most audiences the blair witch projects remains one of the most powerful found footage horror films thanks to its reliance on improvisation from the actors as well as relying on the audiences imagination to create the horrors rather than using cheap jump scares if youre looking to be genuinely scared the blair witch project still manages to be a film that can haunt you today
Jun 29 2014,positive,there is a fair amount of people who bash this film based on the fact that nothing really happens onscreen to which i can only imagine is due to them lacking imagination or just being stupid i for one found this film intensely creepy and at times even terrifying thanks to the way it builds on the fear of the unknown the dark and being lost all portrayed very vividly here 
Jun 26 2014,positive,great hand held horror film lets us use our imagination to create what happens off screen which makes it even scarier the last scene is one of the most bone chilling scenes ive seen
Jun 25 2014,negative,i am a lover of found footage films and i understand that this set the scene for that genre but my issue is the fact that nothing happens with the addition of a few absolutely annoying shots i enjoyed the overall build up of the suspense but with a very anticlimactic ending that buildup meant nothing a lot i wouldve done differently
Jun 25 2014,positive,very realistic and frightening its a slight disappointment that you never get to find out what really killed the filmmakers yet the fear of the unknown and using your own imagination as to who or what the culprit is makes the film ten times more terrifying
Jun 7 2014,positive,i saw this movie once im too scared to watch it again
Jun 1 2014,positive,horror movies nowadays cant compare to this one why because most of them more or less left nothing to your imagination that reason made this one really effectivewhat you dont see with your eyes and make with your mind is terrifyingly enough to drive you crazy
May 29 2014,negative,its got a great concept but i was not impressed when i watched it it hardly made sense and it wasnt really scary at all but hey its been a long time since i watched it so i might have to give it another watch 510
May 25 2014,negative,effectively develops tension  fear of the unknown using found footage however the characters are unlikable  by the end we want more
May 24 2014,negative,i simply cannot find a reason as to why this has a high rating from critics while i do think the idea is cool the raw video i just find this movie awful the girls constant whining made it hard enough to sit through but its just overall boring and dull
May 20 2014,negative,honestlythis is just ok i was bored watching this its just people freaking out in the woods over noises sure there was one part that was creepy but scary no
May 20 2014,negative,honestlythis is just ok i was bored watching this its just people freaking out in the woods over noises sure there was one part that was creepy but scary no
May 18 2014,positive,a movie that contain the horror in a very unique way and does it succesfully its actually rather scary most of the time because of the way it was filmed the acting and the raw way it were portrayed as if it was a true story
May 18 2014,positive,oh wow the confession with the camera aimed at herself  in the penultimate scene is one of the most terrifying images the sheer terror in her eyes  o    also it was pretty much all michaels fault they got lost  what is he on
May 17 2014,positive,i loved this original creepy movie it was real all real no edits so you know what happened i never saw anything like it before at first it was a little slow but the ending i actually understood not like others where ur like wtf just happened great movie 5 stars
May 17 2014,positive,this was so effective with its scares and tension and real characters they got me i got into it i related to the main character and the whole premise was creepy and as the film went along the tension of not only whatever is haunting them rises but also the tension between the friends rises as well which is what scares me when you cant rely on your friends to explain things excellent original film that proves that being as real as possible which sometimes means having to use your imagination is most effective and creative
May 16 2014,neutral,credit to the innovative creators for giving birth to a subgenre and smartly manipulating our fears of the dark the unknown and strange sounds while keeping the titular villain a mystery but to me the scares were largely ineffective until the closing minutes of the film
May 15 2014,positive,a compelling nosedive into psychology insanity and just what makes the human mind tick
May 15 2014,positive,utilizing the realistic foundfootage shtick better than all of its imitators the blair witch project is a genuinely creepy compelling film that earns its place as a classic in the horror genre
May 12 2014,negative,not nearly as creepy as i was led to believe  not the best handheld film ive ever seen and certainly not the best horror film ive seen
May 12 2014,positive,one of if not the most iconic foundfootage movies of alltime due to its realistic performances creepy and dreadful atmosphere and suspense building till the terrifying ending
May 1 2014,negative,perhaps this movie was very scary in 1999 but nowadays it is a laughable and absurd project come on are we gonna get scared by some wood sticks that made me laugh a lot thats stupid and the ending what a dissapointment it looked like some preschool child grounded on the corner because they behaved bad yes thats the situation and they made it to look like that
Apr 27 2014,negative,kept waiting for something to happen  never did
Apr 25 2014,positive,on a psychological level the blair witch project is easily one of the most terrifying films i have ever seen the filmmakers have done something truly special here they have created this inexplicable fear that lingers for well over an hour while seemingly nothing is actually happening within the frame of the scene the flick gives us the very foundation and then leaves things open for interpretation sometimes leaving too much room for your imagination to wander can lead to the darkest and scariest places that you didnt think existed
Apr 23 2014,negative,maybe if i had watched this back in 1999 i would have been scared its a very overrated film and the concept isnt even that original i mean it did popularize the found footage genre which i love for sure but its not the best example of it super shaky camera even my mother warned me about this not very good acting except for the scene where the girl speaks to the camera terrible story and atmosphere like the whole movie is about looking at the floor and dry leaves definitely not listing this one as an example of good found footage films
Apr 21 2014,negative,it may have been scary in 1999 when people thought it was real as it stands now it sets up ones expectations the entire movie only to never be paid off in the end when its over the only question left on your mind is why did i just waste an hour and a half of my life on this pointless meandering in the woods
Apr 16 2014,negative,probably one of the worst movies ive seen no scares and a lot of standing around and yelling at each other found footage was a great idea but not when you were looking at the ground for 75 of the movie
Apr 14 2014,positive,the movie that skyrocketed a genre is almost more interesting as a portrait of how people might behave in a confusing and desperate situation as opposed to just a horror film
Apr 13 2014,positive,this movie is not for every hipster kid around the corner who expects to see a masked killer wandering and killing with a knife  this masterpiece introduced the modern found footage genre which grew to be the most promising horror subgenrethe most frightening experience for the viewer
Apr 11 2014,positive,a misunderstood masterpiece
Apr 11 2014,positive,pretty inventive  i enjoy it and appreciate it more now 15 years later then when i first saw it
Apr 9 2014,negative,it was absolutely horrible thats it
Apr 9 2014,positive,extremely scary very good
Apr 8 2014,positive,just goes to show that you dont need blood gore and scary monsters to make a great horror film
Apr 6 2014,positive,my fav found footage movie
Apr 1 2014,positive,the blair witch project is one chillingly suspenseful movie it uses what isnt there instead of what is to create thrills and the foundfootage aspect makes it seems more realistic which makes it more scary if you can get past the shaky cam and low quality of the film this is a great mockumentary to watch on a friday night
Apr 1 2014,positive,rewatched it in 2022 without remembering much about the plot and i have to say it has aged quite well creepy and scary and of course it has to get extra points because its one of the pioneer and probably most memorable films in the foundfootage genre all that said if you take out its impact and significance on the horror scene and just look at the film for what it is i still consider it to be fairly overrated
Mar 30 2014,positive,a brave movie for its time
Mar 30 2014,positive,extremely disappointed with the ending other than that the film is quite tense and decently acted its really hard to believe that this was the film that launched hollywoods long string of shitty foundfootage films with the exception for the first paranormal activity film and chronicle
Mar 29 2014,positive,it may drag on at parts but its creepy enough and intriguing enough to keep audiences watching to see if the villain will ever show its face
Mar 29 2014,negative,i could rant on about days about how boring the boring witch project is but instead i have dedicated this review to the people who like this shitpile    the boring witch project as you may know is about a group of stupid filmmakers who shoot a doc about a mythical ghost named the blair witch      i am appalled some people found this to be scary sure it has terrifying moments which are still overthe top but the first 70 minutes are tedious in fact the first 70 minutes is some poorly acted junk about talking blah blah blah how terrifying     i know what the people who liked this thing will say the final act is scary  well gee in my opinion it is not that scaryjust over the top and speaking of whichhave i got to the acting the actors received razzies and rightfully so the acting is so over the top the boring witch project works better as a comedy than a horror movie the first 70 minutes is just three idiots bitching on about their location arguing like 12year olds plenty of shaky cam and saying the fword if you think that is scary become a man      oh speaking of shakycam the camera shakes so much it ruins all the possibility of being scared even the ending is plagued by a shitton of shaky cam      final score for the boring witch project 110 stars   even if the ending is scary and overthe top this thing has very few red deeming features the acting sucks and the first 70 minutes are more entertaining than scary this movie is a stupid unintentionally funny overrated scarefest that is in truth not scary at all
Mar 28 2014,neutral,though blair makes effective use of the unseen to create atmosphere its let down by the idiocy of the characters and their actions
Mar 27 2014,positive,a creepy atmosphere and a scary premise leaves the imagination depict whats hiding offscreen very realistic and skillfully done
Mar 25 2014,negative,saw this in theaters in 1999 if youve never seen this youre not missing anything
Mar 25 2014,positive,okay so it seems like a lot of people hate this movie and i can see why but i thought it was a fantastic horror film what the directors were able to do here was create an atmosphere of increasing dread with each thing that goes wrong the characters start to break little by little until theyre all mad with fear and were in the dark just as much as they are  we dont know whats out there so our minds are left to wonder what is happening outside their tent every night there arent any jump scares any unnecessary gore any axemurdering killers just hints of what is really going on and what is going to happen which makes the ending all the more satisfying and terrifying its the best found footage film to grace the big screen in my opinion and is a great horror flick for anybody like myself not big on jump scares or excessive gore
Mar 23 2014,positive,really tuff to decide a score on this one it is absolutely a frightening picture and perhaps the best mocumentary of all time the acting is flawless and believable to the point where it could be scariest thing about the film the plot progresses slowly but perhaps a plot doesnt even exist and the decision to kill off the most compelling character early in the film annoyed me i suppose to sum this up the blair witch project has some sensationally terrifying moments and all to life like running screams and tears it is not without its flaws but going through tho short 80 minute journey is a hell of an interesting ride this is probably riddled with typos and doesnt make sense but it is 3 am so cut me some slack
Mar 23 2014,positive,three people go into the woods to investigate a local legend this is by far one of the most terrifying movies ive ever seen this movie still scares me  i love it
Mar 21 2014,negative,this movie is an exercise in wasted potential if theyd started with normalish characters and had them devolve and done less overactive screaming this would have been scary but it was more like a spanish class video than anything else
Mar 21 2014,positive,effectively scary phenomenal acting
Mar 16 2014,positive,a game changer  this is about three amateur filmmakers shooting a documentary about the mysterious blair witch that is rumored to haunt a forest in burkittsville maryland  things take a turn for the worse when they lose their bearings in the woods and somebody or something starts toying with them whenever they set up camp for the night  now the found footage horror genre has spawned a number of my favorite movies cloverfield rec but i managed to miss the one that really brought the subgenre to the scene back in 1999 so i decided that it was time to remedy that  when this was released it was a phenomenon and there was extensive debate on if this footage was real or staged  obviously rumors have since been debunked on that topic but i purposely suspended my disbelief that these were actors and found it quite easy to do so  everything about this reads authentic from the lowgrade handheld cameras to the improvised naturalistic dialogue and you are able to buy that these people are a real film crew wanting to make a documentary  now i do understand why there are people out there that outright hate this movie as this is a horror film that does ask its audience to be patient  while i do subscribe to the less is more theory of horror when properly handled it can be especially frustrating when theres not a whole lot of payoff at the end which is something that admittedly left me a bit cold when the credits started to roll  i know that pretty much every found footage horror movie ends with the camera abruptly cutting off so i was expecting something along the lines of the ending that is featured but regardless i wanted to at least see a 3  5 second glimpse of the actual antagonist that they built up to for 70 minutes  the fact that the payoff is as noticeably absent as it is must have given additional credibility that this was real so more power to this  it doesnt matter how you feel about this you have to give credit to the blair witch project for paving the way for as many movies as it ultimately did
Mar 15 2014,negative,8  first drawn to mass attention when stories started to spread of cinema goers passing out at early cinema screenings through nothing more than sheer terror and when certain critics spoke of its new unique style i was even more intrigued well as a matter of fact the style wasnt new to anyone familiar with a particularly nasty 70s movie called cannibal holocaust only here thankfully no animals were hacked to tiny pieces by the immoral crew and the movie itself is as scary as well its just not scary it is infact very very dull i zoned out every five or so mins through total boredom toward the end it got a little interesting then the end credits rolled and that was that ill never understand this movies appeal and ill never forgive it for popularising the foundfootage fad that spawned from it
Mar 14 2014,positive,for most of the movie i wasnt impressed but the ending made up for the rest of the movie
Mar 14 2014,positive,one of the scariest movies i have ever seen not because of what dwells in the shadows but of what could possibly be found there keeps you in the dark and therefore letting your imagination take over painting the most horrific picture you could ever imagine leagues above anything that could possibly be shown with special effects
Mar 14 2014,neutral,i can understand why its popular and why the critics like it because it doesnt sell out with the horror and plays with your mind however i have given it a low score because i think the students could have found a little more evidence in the woods and build a bigger picture around the blair witch i found the first hour of the film is them camping and then them getting lost which is nothing but boring the evidence found didnt have to be scary or shocking i only wish that there was a little more story to the film
Mar 13 2014,positive,one of the few horror movies thats actually scared me absolutely brilliant up there with paranormal activity
Mar 12 2014,positive,this is honestly the most suspensful and intense movie i have ever seen as far as characters go we only know what is shown on the tape and their descent into hysteria is both believeable and unnerving it takes away the idea that viewers have to see some gory horrifying creature and instead relies on the root of true fear what our minds create if you want deep plot interesting characters etc look elsewhere but if  you want a deepseated sense of fear watch this horror masterpiece
Mar 11 2014,positive,kind of lame not scary at all
Mar 10 2014,neutral,it had some creepy moments for sure but if you ask me this film is extremely overrated
Mar 9 2014,positive,the power of shaky cam
Mar 8 2014,positive,the blair witch project is a rather interesting film it seems to be one of those films that people either really love or really hate i sort of can see both sides of the argument however i lean towards actually really liking the film i mean its notihng to really love but theres not much to really hate about it either lets get started shall we     the film revolves around three college students who are studying the myth of the blair witch that lives in the forests of maryland they begin filming and documenting their journey for the truth about this witch  tragic and mysterious things begin to happen as a looming evil follows them wherever they go i might as well get to the weak points about this movie firstly the acting ranges form great to really weak lets just say i understand why heather donahue won the worst actress razzie its plainly obvious shes acting in a found footage film or a mockumentary your character needs to come off very real in fact acting in a fake documentary might be even harder than acting in a total fiction film altogether then there are times when she goes very over the top to the point where she sounds like a banshee screaming at the top of her lungs     there are also times when the film just really drags its almost as if the filmmakers struggled to make this a feature length movie and boy does it show  there are times when we look at branches or rocks longer than its needed also i wouldve liked to know a little bit more about our characters here i mean theyre not cardboard cut outs or anything like that but i wish they couldve been fleshed out a little more maybe then these people wouldnt be just victims they could be someone we could relate to and feel a little bit as if we really care about them     now what is it that makes this film really good well firstly i think the realest thing about this movie is atmosphere that it sets up the first 15 or 20 minutes of the film the college kids are interviewing regular town folk about the blair witch these are the best acotrs in the movie and theyre barely in it for five minutes at a time these people dont seem like theyre acting they feel like real people and thats what i wanted from our three mian characters however the characters were given arent necessarily bad you do end up not only feeling sorry for them but feeling theyre fear  we didnt need an old crone or monstrous witch to jump scare us we feel her presence by the way our characters desperation and wanting to get out of the forest and really thats the best thing about the blair witch project its the myth that scares us and not the actual witch that is really hard to pull off in a horror film in fact we dont even know if there really is a blair witch for all we know these kids have totoally lost their mind and end up killing themselves somehow     is the blair witch project perfect of course not there are a lot of pointless scnes and really offbeat acting we have to sit through however i do really like this movie because how different it is which is why i think a lot of people didnt like it its a different type of horror film slasher films were back on the rise at the time because scream had just came out and people didnt like this new style when you think about it the blair witch project would fit in perfectly in this decade found footage films have become their own genre with paranormal activity chronicle etc i do highly recommend this movie because its very different its actually scary and the atmosphere is just as creepy as the legend of the blair witch herself
Mar 4 2014,positive,so this is what started the whole found footage craze
Mar 2 2014,positive,i never thought this iconic horror could make me so afraid of a witch we never actually see number 1 tip dont ever go camping in the woods  always carry two maps overall this film successfully makes you afraid of the unknown which is a rarity in this genre
Mar 2 2014,positive,it made me afraid to go out into the woods
Feb 25 2014,negative,this is not a horror movie without all the cursing it would be gits not that it has no effective scares its that it has no scares at all highly overrated and one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Feb 24 2014,positive,made me very dizzy there was no climax and the end was very horrible
Feb 21 2014,positive,very wellmade with convincing realism and thanks to some good writing and surprisingly great acting it avoids being just schlock and actually being pretty smart in its execution
Feb 14 2014,positive,i really wanted to let myself get taken away by bwp the beginning was really promising but as the walk through the woods went on the constant fighting and yelling became grating and kind of jarred me out of the scare zone i still loved it conceptuallythe andy goldsworthy nature art was really great and i was impressed by the way the actors responded to the unique directing something didnt quite click unfortunately and i got only a bit of a scare at the end and as neat as the concept is its much more of a vehicle for scares than the shyamalan movies ive been watching lately which are all about the story
Feb 9 2014,negative,this film is so overrated blair witch project gets 2 stars from me
Feb 7 2014,positive,this is definitely a movie to watch before you go camping
Feb 3 2014,positive,the creepiest things are the ones not seen intense and suspenseful this mockumentary is scary
Feb 3 2014,positive,15 years ago if you had told me this was going to be one of the next decades defining horror movies lets just say you wouldnt be met to a favorable reaction however for anyone it was hard to believe that not only did this film create a style that would be used countless times but would also be timeless and scare the shit out of you all by doing 3 things right 1 taking a simple and effective way of filming something and allow your audience to paint the picture 2 drag your actors through hell to get results and 3 create a hype machine that would be used still to this day and deliver for those of you that havent seen it blair witch is a found footage film one of the first successful ones of its kind based around 3 student film makers who go hiking into the woods for a weekend with some film kit sound kit and a tent needless to say things dont go at all the way they planned and before time they find themselves cold hungry and hunted its a risky thing to have 3 actors walk about a predetermined mine field of scares and chills with very little directorial power or control over the camera positions or even scripting but here it just works you feel like a 4th member of the party you feel like you know these people inside and out you sympathise with them you fear with them and you worry for their well being tell me how many films in the last 15 years in this genre have done this completely successfully the other 2 master strokes of this film are choosing not to have a monster witch killer or any ghoul on screen at any time this allows us as the viewer to make up in our heads what is out there making up in our heads what it looks like and not confining us with any barricades add into the fact that near the end it also gives you the heightened tension that you are inevitably about to see something jump out instead all you get is a back to the wall an image i still shiver over the final master stroke is the hype this film created the viral campaign making us believe as much as possible that these actors were real people websites were produced to add intrigue and allure the film makers even made many featurettes some documentaries on their fictional witch in all her incarnations this only triples the fear factor this film gives your mind what it needs to scare the hell out yourself and lets you do the rest granted that people who wish to be spoon fed their scares will no doubt despise this outing and people who are not fond of films like rec and vhs will have very little interest in this movie what so ever and thats fine for me however this film has been and for the forseeable future will still be in my top 10 horror films of all time
Feb 2 2014,negative,how this piece of crap movie rates an 87 ill never know it was so totally stupid that these dumb kids go into the woods and cant even read a map these kids are so unintelligent that they couldnt pass the sats to get into college such a ludicrous movie not even scary
Jan 26 2014,negative,starts out ok then goes downhill once they get to the house watch the last broadcast for a real good lost in the woods movie
Jan 24 2014,negative,popular only cause of the camera angles but this is honestly a very boring movie overall a mysterious pile of rocks and wrapped up branches is not quite spooky the worst part is this girl read a book on how to survive in the forest and does everything that is quite counter intuitive and does she always have to record everythingi can understand to a certain extent but when your life is on the line its kind of ridiculous
Jan 22 2014,negative,this was soooo boring the whole time you wait for something to happen and nothing happens in addition its crap quality barely any plotits like a bunch of kids trying to make a horror film
Jan 21 2014,positive,the foundfootage theme of this movie is what makes it creepy you have to feel for heather a well directed movie
Jan 20 2014,positive,the much loved and much hated inspiration of the found footage films is in my opinion a landmark of modern horror that has yet to be equaled no matter how many times it is repeated or referenced  it stands as the source of countless new and inferior installments in the genre and one of the most terrifying films i have ever seen
Jan 19 2014,positive,proving once again that all you need to make a movie is one thing its not fancy cameras or flashy special effects no all you need to make a movie is wit the blair witch project will definitely creep people especially campers
Jan 14 2014,negative,for all the fuss this kind of film generated on the web i though it was a lame cheap horror flick with no real story  not real good fright just a magnificent marketing project
Jan 11 2014,positive,i absolutely love this film it scared me when i first saw it and it scared me again 10 years later and i hope to one day create something like this
Jan 10 2014,negative,i cant tell if this is inventive or a complete waist if crap i lean toward a waist of crap
Jan 8 2014,positive,although it takes a while to get going blair witch provides solely on the imagination of the viewer the movie lets you imagine what happens its a great technique that isnt appreciated by modern filmmakers this is certainly the best foundfootage horror film out there and more movies in the genre should learn from this one
Jan 8 2014,positive,making the best out of the found footage genre this film is very atmospheric with a realistic feeling to it the dialogue is fluid and the decision of what to show and what not is clever to build suspense also the absence of music works great not much is explained at the end but that keeps the intrigue the first of its kind and definetely from the best of the genre  high 710
Jan 4 2014,positive,my favorite horror film
Jan 4 2014,positive, pretty good escapist fare   its gravitas never lives up
Jan 2 2014,negative,oh dearanother film that is massively over hyped not scary at all boring and with a rubbish ending not for me im afraid i know it was made on a very small budget but i cant believe it cost so much
Dec 29 2013,positive,the first of its kind this cult classic should be appreciated for its unique perspective
Dec 29 2013,negative,when this movie came out tons of people loved it  critics especially how different it was how wonderfully artistic and fresh it was  and how much credit does it need to be given for kicking off the found footage genre for real as a horror this film does not work in the slightest  as any horror aficionado would tell you theres very few scares nothing creepy and the final few minutes are the only thing where theres even a bit of real tension other than that its three idiots getting lost in the woods and moaning about it i praise the idea but the execution is horribly flawed
Dec 28 2013,negative,one of the worst films ever
Dec 25 2013,positive,this movie is all atmosphere but it absolutely nails it its a kind of slow burning that makes you feel very unnerved when it reaches finale
Dec 25 2013,neutral,the blair witch project called a great movie as well as golden raspberry award material is an odd film    the blair witch project isnt much of a stimulating film its all built on incorporating in the theme of realism into its plot as the key source of the horror but if that doesnt reach the viewer then its all for nothing the blair witch project relies more on what the viewers will assume is going on based on what is occurring and how the characters are reacting whilst the viewers essentially just wait it out through the running time  in the age of youtube where there are hundreds of amateur films of this calibre available the blair witch project does hold the appeal of being one of the original films to be entirely done on hand held camera and to all be built on the prospect of firstperson fear but the appeal of this only goes so far and so really most of the blair witch project is just waiting for a climax which isnt impressive the characters develop a sense of fear but people who arent light hearted do not   the story is focused on using many small elements to develop it but this proves to reveal to audiences the way that the film itself is a shallow one attempting to make due on improvised ground for its continuous movement but not always being successful or convincing i mean certain horror elements to it do succeed because of the first person camera style which make them come as a surprise but without it they just seem generic and basic   really its hard to say but the blair witch project uses certain elements to the benefit of its film style while others seem like theyre just there to fill the running time of 81 minutes  but really the issue with the blair witch project is how it ends after so much waiting and some weird stuff happening we finally end up in abandoned house from there we get a look in the house and then suddenly theres screams for peoples names a guy dead in the corner and worst of all the silent drop of a camera without even a scream to go with it this climax is all just lot of shaking the camera until suddenly one drops and ends there whats wrong with this is that there were signs of intensity in this scene and by this point any audiences right for the movie will have felt the intense atmosphere build up the only problem is that its over in a second and in that second is the silent sight of a guy hanging in the corner facing away and then the drop of a camera since visual aids were clearly not the main focus here if there were any screams then this scene could have been better and more freaky but alas with the silent drop of a camera it is all over and im sitting there thinking so like what the payoff is unimpressive and if the atmosphere of the ending to the blair witch project was better then perhaps it could have been a stronger film alas that is not the case  i would respect the blair witch project more as a piece of filmmaking than as a film because its an ambitious movie with a low budget that relies on the horror themes to seep in through the fears and anxieties of the viewers instead of through violent visuals and back in the day it managed to do that since now the blair witch project is a dated film it isnt likely to have the same effect but back in the day it would have hit viewers due to the idea of realism in these story and i can respect eduardo sanchez and  daniel myrick for employing that in as directors   honestly much of the issues in the blair witch project come from it being a dated film and how its style is no longer fresh in the age of the internet and the excessive hype behind it makes it a disappointment  but i will say that the actors do a good job  clearly a performance eons away from deserving anything like a golden raspberry award heather donahue manages to make things in the blair witch project seem a little bit more convincing because her emotions just feel that little bit more real and her frailty as a human being is easy to pick up on when the camera pans up on the face of her she gave a strong lead performance and it surely proves beneficial to the blair witch project  michael c williams and joshua leonard also prove to give strong supporting performances adding the same positive elements to the story that heather donahue did  so really the blair witch project may scare you depending on what you define as scary in a film although it didnt scare me or have much of an impact it was an ambitious move and its easy to see where it strikes fear into its viewers even if its a dated film
Dec 18 2013,positive,if you arent scared by this movie you either watched it in a very safe welllit and incorrect setting or you simply lack the imagination to see how truly scary it is some plot points seemed rough but the ruggedness of everything else only makes the film that much more intense
Dec 18 2013,positive,unbelievily creepy
Dec 16 2013,positive,i shall write a review about this film when i feel that i have the sufficient amount of time to write it
Dec 12 2013,negative,i have seen this a few times now x it is scary but not sufficient in the that department for me x yes i would be scared lost in the woods but as a viewer i failed to reach the edge of my seat x
Dec 3 2013,positive,this remains to this day the scariest movie i have seen in my life
Nov 30 2013,positive,movie is absolutely perfect through and through easily the scariest movie ever made simply because of imagination this movie makes you feel as if youre in it its absolutely perfect and close to if not my favorite horror movie ever made a campfire story gone terribly wrong
Nov 29 2013,positive,blow your nose lady and stop being a bitch
Nov 29 2013,negative,style over substance and not very scary
Nov 27 2013,negative,it was lame back in 99 and its still lame today
Nov 25 2013,positive,this is one of the most innovative and ingenious horror films to emerge from the 90s this kind of film cannot be duplicated it is a true stroke of brilliant originality and cannot be capitalized upon by knockoffs or sequelsit is simply a unique work of art i loved the authentic feel to the film and the ambiguity that looms throughout the film really develops a very effective atmosphere that makes you feel as though youre trapped with the characters when an effect like this is achieved in cinema it is something that should be fully appreciated by lovers of cinema and especially lovers of eerie creepy suspense films the end sequence is something i rewatched multiple times just to try to figure it out and as soon as i concluded on one explanation i immediately turned around and entertained a different thought if a film makes me actually think its a winner in my book
Nov 25 2013,positive,something evils out there isnt it you come so close to seeing it but you still dont see it you feel lost curious exhilarated but also threatened you feel threatened and terrified at what this means you shouldnt have come you shouldve just stayed home and watched tv with your dog you should go home but you cant can you because youre lost your map is gone soon your food will be gone maybe even your sanity as well and most likely your life it used to just be a campfire story your friends told you that made you tinkle but now youve grown up and here comes a new generation their stories are grimmer bloodier scarier than yours and the worst part is youre in it my friend   i swear to you this is how youre going to feel when watching this its not very fun at all in fact its the scariest feeling ever probably because this is the scariest movie of all time 8510
Nov 24 2013,positive,classic found footage horror 
Nov 23 2013,positive,without a doubt one of the scariest movies ever created i sht bricks everytine i watch this movie it is so good and its so powerful and sht its scary
Nov 23 2013,positive,when i originally saw it in theaters i was one of the duped who really thought the tapes were legit  its the beginning of the found footage horrors which i really like  i dont care if the camera shakes  they are scary for me
Nov 12 2013,positive,i dont  care what anyone says this movie scared the pants off of me
Nov 11 2013,neutral,the first successful film for its genre this movie sets the stage for successful found footage by making it just believable enough to make it a very good movie
Nov 5 2013,negative,if running around in the woods for an hour and a half is scary to you youre scared pretty easily the blair witch project the movie that started the foundfootage horror genre may be inventive but theres something thats inherently not frightening about a pile of rocks sitting in the woods while movies like paranormal activity were able to bend the audiences perception of reality enough to be truly frightening its very difficult to watch the blair witch project and shake the feeling that its just a movie about three idiots with a 400 camera who went camping and yes its as bad as it sounds    starring three nameless actors the blair witch project is the film that supposedly revolutionized the horror genre with lowbudget effects and a documentary format i have a lot of respect for movies that start trends but the thing is the trend that this movie started sucks foundfootage has been done to the death and nowadays films of its ilk have enormous budgets and insane special effects making it impossible for this generic original to compete i admire it for not resorting to jump scares and attempting to keep up the suspense consistently for 90 minutes but the result isnt scary its terribly boring    not much can be said about a movie like this because there isnt much to it its just an overload of shaky cam bad dialogue and classic horror movie decisionmaking hey i have a map lets throw it in the river what a hilarious prank people dont act like this in real life so why should they in movies i dont ask that all movies directly parallel reality but people should still act like people and they should still make decisions based on logic and rationale and sorry if i cant imagine a situation where this happens but i dont see someone charging out into the woods dragging along a couple of unqualified morons to film a documentary on something as nonsensical as the blair witch    i watched this movie at 1000 at night in the quiet of my room and i wasnt remotely frightened by a moment of it if youre willing to allow yourself to be immersed in the ludicrous world the movie creates then im sure youll be scared but for the viewers who actually have taste and dont find closeup shots of someones runny nose to be scary this is not a good movie by any standard the most frightening moment comes when the characters stumble across a grouping of humanshaped effigies hanging from the trees but even here i couldnt shake this lingering thought in the back of my mind wow the budget on this movie must have been ten bucks not to say that good movies require big budgets far from it but to have a certain level of quality a certain amount of money must be invested in the final product and here it felt like they grabbed three people off the street and said do you want to be in a movie then they got some interns to set up rocks in little piles and whammo a horror classic    no effort was put into this movie so im not going to put any more into my review final score for the blair bitch project 210 stars official anusofcinema seal of approval the acting is bad the characters are dumb and theres not one moment where you are emotionally invested in the movie whatsoever the iconic line in this movie im so scared is monumentally misguided sure youre scared show us instead of tell us anyway this movie isnt watchable even as a timewaster if you want to get the same effect take a cheap camera from best buy then flush it down the toilet after a week go down to the sewers recover its memory chip and watch the video it took itll probably be better than this piece of shit
Nov 2 2013,positive,built an atmosphere of dread and isolation so successfully that it kickstarted an entire genre few if any foundfootage movies released since have been half as effective and none have been anywhere near as influential a lot of that power derives from the ingenious production  the actors really were scared witless in the woods
Oct 30 2013,positive,the only movie ever to scare the fuck out of me for weeks months admittedly young and impressionable at the time nonetheless the blair witch project still remains a horrifying experience ideal watching time  2am
Oct 29 2013,negative,not as terrifying as expected and rather humorous at times did set a precedent for found footage films however
Oct 28 2013,negative,couldnt find anything scary about this and its really really boring
Oct 24 2013,positive,blair witch is a great example of how you dont need excessive gore wellknown actors and a hollywood budget in order to make a truly terrifying film
Oct 18 2013,negative,some cheap scares shaky camera and unsatisfying ending
Oct 16 2013,positive,this movie is atmospheric creepy and well paced
Oct 8 2013,negative,critics are weird  i have no idea why they loved it so much  i fianlly got around to seeing for my first time the other night and i was so disappointed  nothing happened  you didnt see anything creepy you didnt hear anything creepy just the kids running from apparent nothingness and a constant stream of sht were so lost  sob sob cry cry sht  omg we are sooo lost  omg what are we going to do  thats it  very very boring and very disappointing
Oct 6 2013,positive,i found it rather cleverly creepy and effective i found the bickering went too far though and the story was pretty weak a fairly brilliant simple low budget film that was prototype for found footage films
Oct 5 2013,negative,one of the pioneers of the found footage genre this was probably great when it came out i didnt have the fortune of seeing it but remember the hype around it finally seeing it in a post paranormal activity world this movie is incredibly boring the pa movies get flak for nothing happening but this one was even worse in that regard kept waiting for something to happen but it never did what a disappointment maybe i should have watched this a long time ago
Oct 5 2013,negative,apart from being not scary at all it is also dull and irritating a totally overrated movie
Oct 4 2013,negative,stupid and not even remotely scary
Oct 4 2013,negative,the story is just stupid really somebody was that stupid to get rid of the map in a forest because fuck you the characters are just annoying and the im filming an amateur video never really works because in some scenes is just an awkward distraction like are you seriously filming during an argue where everyone is losing their minds really and when it finally could have started getting creepy it ends
Oct 3 2013,positive,when i watched this movie as a child i thought it was real my mother had to convince me and show me all of the details online to calm my nerves now i watch it with respect but i still feel uneasy once they enter the witchs house good mockumentary yet can still be watched with some humor
Sep 28 2013,negative,i just do not understand the hype behind this film perhaps because it was a pov horror which is already difficult to produce and to produce well either way the only way i found this film entertaining was as a comedy firstly heather never stops talking for more than 2 secs throughout the entire film secondly the witch or whatever thats after them is more suggested rather than actively visible was that white dot supposed to be it and thirdly those of you who have scene the horrorcomedy scary movie will not be able to watch the famed snot scene without bursting into uncontrollable fits of giggles trust me on that i do think this film would be a good film for a beginner which is why i gave it 2 stars
Sep 25 2013,positive,even though it was nominated for worst film of 1999 at the golden raspberry awards  i think that there is a lot to like about this movie  for starts anyone who has ever gone camping will know the suspense and jumpiness one will feel while speaking of a scary story at an open fire  and those feelings are brought to life in this movie as the frightening moments of this movie become greater and greater as the movie rolls long thats the second great thing about this movie  the third is the ending  i was paralyzed in fear when i first saw it and i couldnt sleep right that night afterwards  whether you will love or hate this movie anyone who hasnt seen it should do so just so that they can say that they did
Sep 23 2013,positive,scary and packed with amazing performances blair witch is moody keeps it real and delivers a flawless ending
Sep 21 2013,negative,too bad i cant get that hour and 27 mins back
Sep 19 2013,positive,hmmm saw this one in the cinema so gave it three stars because the atmosphere in the audience probably added to the creep factor  saw it a few years later on dvd  it was ok but wouldnt go out of my way to watch it again
Sep 17 2013,positive,the blair witch project is the first foundfootage film to get a considerable amount of hype behind it and is also the film that kickstarted the foundfootage genre we have today  did the film live up to all the hype behind it  to many people it didnt live up to it  this film is one of the more polarizing films ive ever seen  in my opinion the film did not live up to the hype but i still thought it was a decent film  i thought it was great that they could do so much with a little budget and no special effects  i liked the characters save one and i felt their plight  the story is as follows  three college students heather michael and josh are making a documentary on the blair witch legend  they interview a few people who know the legend and some even claim to have seen the witch  then they go into the woods to look for more evidence but end up getting lost  they soon learn that there is someone following them  is it the blair witch or is it just a crazy person  whoever it is it starts hunting them down one at a time     this film does do a lot right  it has a very interesting legend behind it  the start of the film is the main characters interviewing people about the blair witch phenomenon and the legend surrounding her is quite interesting  the film also has great atmosphere  there is a sense of mystery with throughout the film  are the stories really real  who is hunting the main characters in the woods  was it the blair witch or just a crazy person  i like that they did not actually show who is behind this  whether they had shown a crazy person or a witch it would have been disappointing and would have ruined the sense of mystery    the lack of special effects really adds to the realism the film is going for  too many foundfootage films use cgi or some sort of effects and it really does not work  foundfootage films are meant to give a sense of realism and give the idea that this really happened  in my opinion this film is the only one to really pull that notion off    i did like most of the characters  to be more exact i like two out of the three characters that are in the film  michael and josh i thought were liable and funny and i felt for them when things went wrong    the girl heather i do not like at all  she was too pushy she complains a lot and she treats mick and josh like crap a lot  everything always has to go her way or she freaks out  she brought the movie down quite a bit for me  also the shakycam bothered me  i know its foundfootage but i thought there was too much shakycam  plus there were many scenes shot too dark  the scenes at night were so dark i couldnt understand a thing that was happening     overall i thought the blair witch project is a decent experiment  it was not an amazing film as it was hyped up to be but i think it is still good  whether you love it or hate it the film did have a huge impact on the movie industry  it did kickstart the foundfootage genre for better or worse  i would say it is definitely worth at least one viewing
Sep 15 2013,positive,very scary and with convincing characters
Sep 15 2013,positive,if we talk about the real art of terror you probably would like to talk about this movie
Sep 14 2013,positive,wellacted influential and sutibly terrifying blairwitch is a prime example of what you can do with a low budget and no gore the effective one dollar thrills are much better than the repetitive scares avaliable in the foundfootage market today
Sep 14 2013,negative,three film students go missing after traveling into the woods of maryland to make a documentary about the local blair witch legend leaving only their footage behind     stars  heather donahue michael williams joshua leonard bob griffith jim king sandra s√°nchez ed swanson patricia decou kim richards bob griffin and  michael c williams    directed by daniel myrick and eduardo s√°nchez
Sep 7 2013,negative,this film survived purely by carefully crafted media hype  the movie is however regrettably unwatchable  i vividly remember expecting the film to get going now through out the first half and sitting in despair for the second  im afraid this movie is in my top 10 worst movies of all time
Sep 6 2013,negative,the scariest thing about the blair witch project is how horrible it is filmed
Sep 5 2013,positive,watch it at night and it will creep you to the bones
Aug 30 2013,positive,while it was well done on budget and told quite well it didnt live up to the hype and i think that was the problem
Aug 17 2013,positive,this film sparked such a pivotal movement in the horror genre the acting may have been mediocre but the direction was innovative i recommend it as a watch but i dont think i would ever buy it
Aug 13 2013,neutral,a shitty mysterious way to waste your 85 minutes
Aug 5 2013,positive,not that bad watch it until the end this is when shit gets real
Aug 4 2013,positive,a terrifying example of psychological horror done right its final scene leaves a particularly disturbing impression
Aug 3 2013,positive,even freakier when youre 11 years old and think its real
Aug 2 2013,positive,a triumph of the foundfootage horror genre
Jul 31 2013,positive,one of the scariest films of all time because of how much it leaves up to your imagination
Jul 31 2013,negative,stop screaming put the camera down and leave the forest its not that hard to do
Jul 31 2013,positive,as i sit down here and write this review for the blair witch project the hairs on the back of my neck are sticking straight up this film has been regarded as one of the best and scariest horror movies ever made and i completely agree there is no denying that this film will inevitably scare the majority of its audience members thanks to the way it was cleverly crafted the premise of the film is simple three students journey into the woods to film a documentary regarding the famous blair witch legend but end up entering a terrifying world of voodoo and witchcraft the main reason why this movie succeeds in the scare department is thanks to its foundfootage style of filming with two cameras its very atmospheric and helps to further engross the audience into the three students terrifying situation the best part about this whole film in my opinion is the fact that you never see the films titular villain  thus meaning that the audience need to make use of their imagination and paint a frightening picture in their head of this villain that poses a threat to these three unfortunate students this is genius because it proves that imagination can be as scary as anything onscreen and in this movie it works like a charm this movie would have made alfred hitchcock proud
Jul 28 2013,positive,an absolutely pitchperfect scarefest that remains one of my alltime favorite movies
Jul 28 2013,positive,way underrated by the show me the monster and the gore and explain everything to me horror movie crowd this is one of the few horror films that actually scared me  there is little gore but the dread of the unknown the despair of being hopelessly lost in unfamiliar territory and the sheer horrific anticipation of knowing one is the prey to a stronger force make the witchs torture the motives of which are completely unfathomable so much more terrifying than some oaf with a machete in a hockey mask
Jul 24 2013,positive,the blair witch project proves that your imagination is scarier than what you see
Jul 24 2013,positive,the pace at which the wheels come off is key in this horror gem
Jul 21 2013,negative,this ones a snoozer
Jul 18 2013,positive,fresh and original horror movie ever made but whats happen with the ending
Jul 18 2013,neutral,an ambitious independent horror movie however with its shaky camera work which is intentional and its ambiguities the blair witch project leaves some uncertainty that is often lead to the viewers imagination    blair witch paved the way for the found footage style films specifically paranormal activity the concept is actually genius and great for a horror film however it is very slow paced and other than the psychological aspect of it nothing scary actually happens until the films end an ending which is actually quite frightening and leaves you asking questions the progression is quite interesting from the various things occurring in the forrest and the discovery of the erie stick figures deep in the forrest this is when the creepy events begin to take over    the film is greatly conceived and is no doubt a film you must watch more than once its concept is great and no doubt one groundbreaking horror film but to really get the full effect pay attention be patient and let your mind think for you performances were good and the film itself did what its purpose was to seem real however i think the hype that surrounds the film and its legacy may make the movie seem more than what it really is i give this a mixed review because it felt slow paced shaky camera work to the point where it was dizzy and a buildup to give us an uncertain ending that seemed to try so hard to be scary an innovator yes no doubt this film was but also in my opinion overrated
Jul 15 2013,negative,i know its trying to look authentic and realistic but even realism has its limits before it just looks like something done in a few days with a vhs cam
Jul 14 2013,positive,one of the most innovative horror films ever made the blair witch project reminds us what we dont see is scarier than what we do and what we dont know is scarier than what we do
Jul 12 2013,positive,filming horror documentary that changed the generation fear struck to my bones a classic
Jul 7 2013,positive,review coming soon
Jul 6 2013,positive,the blair witch is the finest example of a what a horror movie should be like staying away from the hollywood gore cliches splitting up tripping when running and terrible acting the acting is some of the best i have ever seen and knowing there was no script or true outline for the film makes it double impressive the true fear is seeing it from their eyes being skeptical then never fully understanding what it is thats chasing them  and never seeing it its become cool to hate the film but those who do lack imagination and dont appreciate the true art of this film
Jul 5 2013,positive,one of the most scariest atmospheric horror films ever made
Jul 2 2013,positive,clever and very creepy
Jul 1 2013,positive,more emotional terror than visual
Jul 1 2013,negative,this movie is claimed as terrifying the way i see it is like this 3 dumb people want to go into the woods and look for a witch in this film you dont see anything i get that could be entertaining but not in this movie this is only my opinion but this movie is 2 out of 5 stars for me
Jun 29 2013,negative,is this supposed to scare someone is the script any good is this movie any good 2 stars of 5 the acting is the only good thing this movie hasthe story development was going great until they entered the forest and started looking as an awful film yes the idea was to see this 3 students doing a project that ended been an amateur moviea horrendous movieawful is the word for a 1999 film filmed on 1997 to 98 was not bad on that timethanks to this movie we can see awful movies today as paranormal activity rec is the only one who is not awful since is amazingminus rec 3 anyway 2 stars is enough since there was also no score or special effectscrickets dont count or kids laughing or screaming so yesthis is my reviewand yes after this came a sequel which was also boringand if you were as i when watching that last sceneit was the last same ritual same ending after that the police finds the camera with the amateur footagethe endi expected more when people said this was an amazing filmdont like amateur filmsi try really but dont like them i enjoy independent movies but this kind of movies are not my taste but thats just my opinion chao  june 29 2013
Jun 28 2013,negative,seriously this is what all the critics praise what a joke just cheap scares
Jun 27 2013,positive,while blair witch isnt for everyone and the naturalistic acting can get annoying at times it raises the scare factor up to eleven through its unique style that none of its predecessors or successors are able to match its absolutely worth seeing
Jun 22 2013,negative,did not like this movie one bit was super cheesy
Jun 17 2013,positive,a very effective terrorhorror film the format of the movie helps the atmosphere a lot and builds itself every time more and more terrifying its not for everyone though as the movies one dimensional storytelling might bore or bother some people more than horror them    i have this theory that suggest the really terrifying films are disliked by most of the audiences mostly becausewell they do scare there are films like alien from ridley scott where we see the monster although barely and in the dark theres also spielbergs jaws where the giant shark is kept out of the camera halfthe movie and the other half hes shown without any preparation and its size was the cherry on the cake blair witch applies a new form whatever its the monster or creature is never ever shown but cryptic remains or clues of it are there we dont see the witch at all but we do see her actions and that gives another terrifying power the imagination how is she what is she how she does all this why its a huge dilemma its purely the unknown and as humans we fear the unknown especially when all we know about it is that it can hurt us kill us or even worse its an ingenious formula but thats not the only aspect of it    we also have the perfect location the woods in the nowhere were no one is there to help you when everything you need is far away where the darkness is all around once its the nighttime and for the worse its cursed you can never get out of there the more you walk the more nowhere youre getting the only places you can found in that loop are creepy areas both in the day and in the night holly shit that is unbelievable and surely its one of the worst places ever and there the imagination is at hand yet again you hear screams and laments at night what is happening youll never know but you know its something painful and that gives anybody the creeps    also lets look at other things in which this movie succeeds and other foundfootage horror films have failed first the characters theyre unknowns so they act like real people not like dumb horny teenagers and we identify with their despair at the worst times i know how hard it is to stay up in the woods but surely i never got stuck on the middle of the woods and ran for days and days to get to nowhere it was hard just being there so imagine how abysmal would it be if all these shit also happen sure it cant but then again thats what makes this movie work the imagination infinite possibilities all of them terrifying all i have to say is i think its effective i cant say that i loved it because its supposed to be a terrifying experience and a real one isnt pleasant at all this one has a combination of both i love its horror factor at the same time that made it scary and unpleasant it was very traumatic for me at first but in the end its just a movie an experience not something that should make me shit my pants for the rest of my life    but no movie is without its flaws the pacing of this one both helps and hardens the simple thing of sitting through it it takes patience to enjoy it and to be honest at first i wasnt patient at all but if i can go through peter jacksons three hour epics and such awful movies like manos i can handle this hour and a half horror film the ending i thought was terrifying and horrorish but not everyone will take it the same way as many would see it as sporadic and rushed it is hard to gravitate towards it but personally this is one of the scariest films ive ever watched give it a chance if you havent see it
Jun 12 2013,negative,seems a lot like cheesy scares throughout without any actual horror shown anywhere throughout basically just a movie that plays with your mindbut makes us wait for the creatures till the end which is a big dissapointment  the high rt rating for this just goes about to show how easily the critics get scared p
Jun 10 2013,negative,i dont know why this movie received universal acclaim from critics at the time of its release maybe it was because it was unique and started the trend of found footage films i found most of it quite dull and boring the only interesting part was the last 15 minutes of the film
Jun 5 2013,positive,it is really scary even with the mediocre acting this found footage style horror creeps me out couldnt let my guard down thumbs up
May 28 2013,negative,when this movie came out it was a hit i dont know why it was a waiste of time they build up suspense for no reason
May 28 2013,negative,hey lets go into the woods shake the camera and scream like idiots for an hour and 24 minutes and call it a horror movie
May 27 2013,positive,to gimmicks no cheats no budget just pure raw horror
May 26 2013,positive,where theres advertisements theres normally hype and where theres hype there money to be made  sometimes that hype doesnt add up to what it was made out to be  this movie was said by some to be scary as hell and terrifying  was it  well i wouldnt call the film scary  the first hour of the film is more of a setup for what is to come  i am a huge fan of the found footage genre  most found footage films get scary fifteen minutes after it starts  this one did not  so if you arent a fan of the genre i advise you not to watch the film  with that said i cant say that i wasnt affected by the film  the phycological viewpoint of the film is so authentic and realistic that its hard not to get goosebumps  for anyone who wants to watch a landmark in horrors history and still get a surprising amount of chills they might want to look into this flick which in my opinion was the creep show of its day
May 21 2013,positive,that s scary film in indie film
May 20 2013,positive,i cant complain too much about it the blair witch project is an excellent spinetingling mockumentary didnt like the script at all times but its still creepy nor does it deserve some of the criticism it got it takes time to sink in and its a little slow but thats okay
May 19 2013,negative,i kept waiting for the big scare of this film one eternity later i could of died and came back to life  and what a surprise it never came here is the plot in a nutshell random teens get lost in the woods ahhh the end okay i will give it credit for the creepy witch ladys face in the end or did i dream that when i fell aseep during it oh well by the way this movie is a work of fiction never happened
May 18 2013,negative,awful trash  not scareyjust pathetic
May 13 2013,negative,buying and predictable definately no exorcist
May 10 2013,positive,alright movie but the ending was way creepy 
May 8 2013,positive,everything is there to make it scary but not all of it did for certain reasons the blair witch project required a little bit more suspense and less screaming and running around
May 7 2013,positive,scary shit when i first watched
May 7 2013,negative,went vomit coz of the shaking cam
May 6 2013,positive,it made an impact on movies today and it made me sick to my stomach
May 1 2013,negative,3 kids in the woods with a flash light
May 1 2013,positive,good considering the low budget raw
Apr 29 2013,negative,this has to be my all time worst movie i have ever seen its so bad it made me sick if you like shitheads walking around with an camera shooting in the dark and yelling out and shaking the crap out of the camera then your a shithead with no taste its such an bad movie dont know how people like this shit
Apr 26 2013,positive,scary no original yes
Apr 25 2013,negative,over hyped film not in the least bit scary i was bored through most of it
Apr 24 2013,negative,it may scare some but did not scare me this was a poorly directed written and acted film some of the most unlikable characters i have ever seen all this movie is is a group of college kids who dont know how to carry a camera and also dont know how to curse 055 stars for this discrase to horror films i hate everything about it
Apr 24 2013,neutral,i guess im one of the only ones who didnt really enjoy it very few scares and no climax good idea bad results
Apr 24 2013,positive,horror films never get me scared and rarely even manage to creep me out but this film succeeded i had strong beliefs that horror just couldnt work on me but this proved me wrong this movie was beyond intense for me i was just far too involved with everything i honestly grabbed my childhood teddy and had a tear of fear in my eyes just before the credits ran     this is the greatest horror i have ever seen
Apr 23 2013,positive,couldnt have cared less about its three annoying characters but the movie is still scary as fuuu
Apr 19 2013,positive,creepy with a haunting atmosphere the blair witch project provides the audience with an eerie feel as we observe the frightening tale of three missing students for their own point of view
Apr 19 2013,negative,as a horror enthusiast this movie was a definite mustsee on my bucket list what with critics and viewers pronouncing it a classic of the horror genre i felt nearly obliged to give the blair witch project a try    to say that i was disappointed would be a severe understatement expecting a suspenseful genuinely good horror film i couldnt help but feel a little cheated as a viewer the blair witch project is nothing but an utter and complete bore the suspense a key factor in a good horror is virtually nonexistent the plot poorly developed and the effect of the shaky camera most likely an attempt at creating a sense of suspense  simply annoying i sat through the entire film giving it chance after chance waiting for something to happen that would make the hour and a half of my life i devoted to this movie worthwhile needless to say i was once again disappointed blair witch ended without one scene that would make me as much as flinch or want to look away the final scene was no exception  it struck me as unoriginal and entirely too vague when the credits started rolling i sat with my eyes still on the screen and wondered whether i had indeed seen the right movie since then i have made a point of never watching a film based solely on its reputation
Apr 19 2013,negative,ive heard so much about this film that i was really disappointed when i finally saw it a good horror movie should provide suspence and a bit of fear lasting at last for some time this was simply boring the plot seemed more scary while reading about it than while watching it the development of action was too slow and i couldnt help yawning unfortunately a good idea for a movie wasnt enough
Apr 18 2013,positive,never seen this before isnt that weird if you can buy into it this becomes one of the most effective horror movies ever aint no cheap scares here only a perfectly simple crescendo of anxiety and dread im still not sure that i buy into found footage as a style but this is definitely the best case made for it that i can think of one of the best descents into madness ive seen in a bit blair witch reveals paranormal activities for the bottom of the barrel pukes they are
Apr 18 2013,positive,an artistic touch to the horror genre makes this found footage film not just creepy but interesting as well although it couldve been scarier
Apr 16 2013,negative,flat out boring and not scary  the blair witch project is just so damn boring and void of horror  the actors were annoying as hell and moronic as all hell  the premises is nice but falls apart on top of itself  honestly when each night came i was constantly disappointed and constantly thinking if these characters had any mental capacity to be in this situation in the first place  simply the film shows how stupid ass kids die legend or not  found footage films for me usually dont work simply because i know its bs and makes it hard for me to push away reality blair witch project doesnt help me at all and fails miserably
Apr 15 2013,positive,the best found footage film
Apr 14 2013,negative,i hated it its not scary or suspenseful its completely and utterly boring the ending was simply terrible and the whole movie i could barely stay awake the best part was the credits wait no the best part was when the woman getting interviewed was talking and her son was crying he knew how bad the movie was     dont watch this trash its completely overrated and there is no horror to it boring
Apr 12 2013,positive,ahhh the beginnings of found footage films  at least my first  so well done that the media actually thought it was real  good times
Apr 11 2013,positive,maybe i have low standards for horror films but i was terrified
Apr 11 2013,negative,boring and stupid youd have to be as dumb as hollywood thinks you are to think this was anything but a pt barnumism
Apr 10 2013,positive,i remembered in high school this film freaked me out for a couple weeks
Apr 10 2013,negative,you know for all the blair with project is praised as one of the scariest and best movies of all time im highly inclined to disagree it took me a long time to get around to watching this and its certainly a over hyped film i never really felt the prospect of fear in the film at any point however occasionally it felt isolated but too be frankly nothing actually happens in the film and well you never actually see anything
Apr 4 2013,negative,i figured i should at least see this movie once in my life maybe it was good 14 years ago but compared to whats out there now this movie is nothing and when i say nothing i mean literally nothing things happen while the kids are in the woods but you never actually see anything its just the kids reactions to previously mentioned things not scary not worth it
Apr 3 2013,negative,one of the worst horror films ever  there is absolutely nothing scary about this movie so i dont understand why its so critically acclaimed  just a 90 minute snooze fest with no payoff
Apr 3 2013,positive,a chilling and believable film that sparked a genre many have tried to capitalize on
Apr 3 2013,positive,found footage films today leave nothing to the imagination thats what makes the blair witch project different from the rest the imagination is the scariest part of the movie mostly everything is off screen but the topnotch acting and beautifully eerie sound design keep this cult classic moving
Apr 2 2013,negative,tarded and so fake
Mar 28 2013,positive,i want to see it now
Mar 26 2013,positive,possible the most realistic found footage film we will ever see scary and intense
Mar 26 2013,neutral,good movie just not scarykinda bland
Mar 26 2013,positive,thought it was so scary till i found out it was fake
Mar 25 2013,negative,what a letdown this movie is so over hyped its unbelievable
Mar 24 2013,negative,awful wretched terrible wasteful and many worse adjectives do not begin to describe this movie homogeneously unbearable film unqualified to entertain all but the simplest of single celled organism really bad
Mar 23 2013,positive,a truly scary and memorable experience
Mar 21 2013,negative,this movie sucked big time
Mar 20 2013,negative,not as great as it seems
Mar 17 2013,positive,its good but i wait much more
Mar 16 2013,positive,hasnt aged well but the blair witch project is still intense unsettling and altogether one of the best socalled found footage films
Mar 16 2013,positive,this film is very interesting to review its like marmite you even love it or hate its the same with this film it concept of this film is fantastic very smartly written and well made for a very low budget its is well directed but the only problem is its not as good as it should of been it seems to lack something but at the same time it has a new fresh idea of horror film just dont expect too much from this film id say watch once then you judge what you think
Mar 9 2013,positive,i really appreciate the nontraditional style of this horror movie
Feb 28 2013,negative,nothing but a movie full of darkness as the viewer doesnt see anything but their faces
Feb 27 2013,negative,good marketing campaignmovie not so much
Feb 24 2013,negative,i was only really scared because my sister and i went to a movie theatre that we didnt know in a neighbourhood that we didnt know
Feb 21 2013,positive,blair witch proves that what you cant see can hurt you well at least scare you quite a bit
Feb 19 2013,positive,a return to insanity following the runaway success of wes cravens selfaware slasher scream 1997 its proliferated sequel scream 2 1998 and the subsequent resurgence of finally thought to be dead shaggy dog horror franchises a la childs play halloween et al that were unfortunately resurrected in its wake though hardly a wholly original setup weve seen the found footage mockumentary gag employed 25 years earlier in italys notorious cannibal holocaust here youre only afforded what goes bump in the night but what is truly unnerving is watching the three young protagonists slowly come unraveled after getting lost while shooting a documentary about a local urban legend in massachusetts wilderness that seemingly stretches on for infinity
Feb 19 2013,negative,oh this was more funny than scary
Feb 8 2013,positive,i fucking love this movie
Feb 7 2013,positive,scary as hell still the best foundfootage style horror movie because by the end were sympathetic with all the characters it leaves almost everything to the imagination and its actually scary the final 4 or 5 minutes take terrordreadsuspense to a whole new level that i still dont think has been beat by another horror movie yet
Feb 6 2013,negative,i was scared when i first saw it but i will never watch it again was just the hype around it at the time of release
Feb 5 2013,positive,for straight up thrills this is on top of the game the total lack of knowledge control or even clear sight and sound has the imagination running at full pace this mockdoc will leave most shaking with adrenaline for a while to come
Feb 5 2013,negative,horrible i could make a better movie with my camcorder
Feb 2 2013,negative,that was one of the most terribly scripted and acted movies ive ever seen and was not even remotely frightening
Jan 29 2013,positive,the chick needs a hankie
Jan 27 2013,negative,more hype than movie
Jan 27 2013,positive,fucking original and freakin scary made you think it was a real camcorder tape plus all the internet bullshit saying it was realgreat hype
Jan 26 2013,positive,the blair witch has been endlessly parodied imitated and even copied yet after these years it is still intensely startling and uniquely original
Jan 25 2013,negative,pure crap not scary f
Jan 23 2013,negative,though a staple for found footage films it is utterly boring and has almost no even partially scary moments the acting though is not as bad as i expected and you can feel how afraid the characters are i did not enjoy it but it wasnt terrible
Jan 22 2013,positive,a film anyone could make but i love it because of the tv movie curse of the blair witch which is better than the movie a great created mythology highly recommend the da stern dossier as well
Jan 22 2013,positive,without a doubt  since its release theres something called before and after the bwp
Jan 21 2013,negative,absolute arse gravy of the worst kind appalling film that spawned a genre that lacks appeal leave documentary making to the bbc and such like
Jan 20 2013,neutral,some creepy parts overrated in general
Jan 20 2013,positive,this is a great movie if this movie came out today it might not have had the same impact as it has on horrorfound footage movies i first saw this when i was nine years old and was extremely terrified fourteen years later i still am this movie proves that what cant be seen is scary i am happy i had my first taste of this genre with the one that really started it all because there was nothing else like it at the time todays audience will most likely laugh at it because of the other films using this same technique that is unfortunate but nothing can send chills down your spine more than not being able to see what you are chasing after or being chased by this is truly a brilliant film when considering how it reinvented the horror genre the acting is as real as you can get that is what makes the movie so terrifying definitely worth it to watch
Jan 19 2013,negative,can i give this zero stars  this movie unfortunately kicked off a whole generation of film hacks making terrible movies in shakycam
Jan 18 2013,positive,i waited 13 years to see this movieit was worth it
Jan 16 2013,positive,those noises in the woods still scare the shit outta me
Jan 16 2013,positive,i thought the film did an excellent job demonstrating how terrifying and how you can lose your mind being lost in the woods  a ghostly tale being acknowledged before the search is scary enough as it is and having strange things happen while camping out would frighten any of us  i thought the film lacked more scare factor and was only terrifying on the big screen
Jan 15 2013,positive,not usually a fan of scary movies but this one kept me interested throughout its hour and 20 minute runtime
Jan 13 2013,positive,was good when it first came out due to the whole is it real or not publicity
Jan 12 2013,positive,this film is constructed upon found footage of three young film students who with the purpose of making a documentary about a local witch who has been linked to murders and mysterious occurrences for over 200 years and get lost in the endless woods hunted the simple storyline and perhaps overtly shaky camerawork does not stop this from being a shocking and disorienting experience that ended up revolutionising the world of low budget cinema
Jan 10 2013,negative,i found it quite boring
Jan 8 2013,negative,ill save u the time its just shaky camera that doesnt throw shit to make you even gasp in fear or any emotion whats so ever
Jan 7 2013,positive,if you would ask me what film have you watched that just terrified you more than any other  id say the blair witch project i was 13 years old the first time i saw this movie watched it in complete darkness and at the time i believed it was all real footage i couldnt sleep all night truly a work of art
Jan 5 2013,positive,img     possibly one of the most innovative horror films ever made the blair witch project is not only consistently scary but also a recreation of modern horror in the sense that it explores how not knowing the source of what is frightening you is a far worse experience than actually staring the threat in the eyes its a film that benefits from its micro budget restraints and is much better than what it could have been as a result namely a generic stalk horror movie the acting is also much better than i first expected i sincerely hope the cast get a chance to take part in some great things any time soon i have to say that despite its lack of developed characters you believe in them and care for the horrible situation that theyre in a situation that you also dont fully understand it is wonderfully directed and probably the only found footage horror ive ever seen where i genuinely believed the events that took place were part of reality the only mistake made was a slight repetition of plot points nevertheless this is really worth watching it isolates you makes you ponder stays with you and distresses your psychology almost effortlessly some people might give the blair witch project a bad time but those same viewers probably require serial killers and monsters handed to them on a silver platter to feel alarmed rather than allowing the power of atmosphere and imagination to slip underneath their skin
Jan 4 2013,positive,its difficult to be fair judging this film in nowadays parameters because almost all its success was due to its innovative approach surely it was not the first documentarystyle horror film but it was the first one to reach a great amount of people and it started a new style of horror whose offspring is every year showing up on theaters   seeing it again i felt like nothing happened nothing is actually shown and i knew nothing would be shown and how the story was going to end but by the time i watched it for the first time as i was trying to discover along with the characters what was going on there the film was really compelling and showed that creativity can be more important than budget when the aim is to scare an audience  the blair witch project is certainly a modern genre classic
Jan 3 2013,negative,it was marketed well
Jan 3 2013,positive,the film that started all the camera film movies a truly terrifying ending with excellent alternative endings a real must see
Jan 3 2013,positive,one of the best horror films ive ever seen      just brilliant  it scared the shit out of me for a few weeks watch it now 
Jan 2 2013,negative,i could do better with less equiptment oh wait all they had was a camera but i could stilldo better bunch of fags
Dec 31 2012,positive,a solid ghost story and the characters are at least more interesting than most horror movies ive seen
Dec 31 2012,positive,the greatest hype ever pulled on moviegoers can you believe that morons thought this was actually real there is something to appreciate with the blair witch project and its not in the movie but rather in the marketing a cool concept doesnt seem remotely scary in the way that other ghost or lore stories succeed in using your imagination crap camera work and huffing and puffing doesnt help to create fear the only time the movie has any momentum is towards the end and thats it i like the beginning documentary part of it and cant say that i hated the whole movie too much repetitiousness in conflict scenes of getting lost or dealing with heather still the blair witch project is one of those movies that i cannot dislike entirely it does capture the outdoors in the season of fall with a cool back story involving the legend of the blair witch i just wish that there was more to it
Dec 30 2012,positive,the scariest film of all time
Dec 29 2012,positive,sometimes the things we cannot see are what frighten us the most  this movie proves this
Dec 29 2012,positive,scary back in the day  man they made a huge profit off of this
Dec 27 2012,negative,overrated  big time
Dec 26 2012,positive,definitely potential nightmare fuel the blair witch project will change your future camping experiences
Dec 26 2012,positive,admit it this was good at the time
Dec 25 2012,negative,theres two hours i will never get back
Dec 23 2012,positive,it was creepy the first time i watched but became even creepier after i kept thinking about it and doing research on the legend of the blair witch this film had  me thinking about it for days and doing research on it which really freaked me out
Dec 22 2012,positive,creepy will shock and scare you
Dec 22 2012,positive,one of the best comedies ever just dont watch it in surround sound
Dec 22 2012,positive,this movie was scary as hell well i have been reading the myths of the blair witch and its really interesting i liked it a lot it had a creepy atmosphere showed amazing acting its about a group of college students that go in the woods and start disappearing this was a really creepy movie she first scares you then snatches you in the middle of the night thats all im going to say    grade   a
Dec 22 2012,positive,they just dont make horror movies like this anymore
Dec 20 2012,negative,nothing but a bunch of idiots recording themselves running and screaming in the middle of the woods i dont care if it started a new genre in film making it still doesnt excuse the fact its just retards screaming in the woods
Dec 19 2012,negative,ick  waste of time and moneyless than 12 a starmore like 2 stars
Dec 19 2012,negative,bad editing awful writing and terrible directing are no excuse for a film found in the woods
Dec 18 2012,negative,ill never understand the fuss over this movie
Dec 18 2012,positive,original bon suspense
Dec 18 2012,negative,this is so boring and unscary that it doesnt even deserve half a star
Dec 16 2012,negative,i live not to far from here and even i didnt like this movie  give me a break
Dec 15 2012,positive,cant watch this one from beginning to end for it creeps me out
Dec 14 2012,positive,the classic psychological horror film that spawned a movement of fauxdocumentary offshoots few of which have come close to touching the ingenuity and genuine creepiness of the original
Dec 13 2012,positive,completely original and a truly underappreciated film  this was without a doubt one of the best and most successful early experiments with viral marketing  i remember leaving the theater saying that was so dumb out loud to my siblings  but secretly freaking out about the idea of ever going camping again  i have tried unsuccessfully to reproduce the original excitement and fear from the first time i watched it as an 8th grader but part of the greatness lies within its prerelease teasers and ad spots  this should have gone down as one of the greatest horror advances to date but it fell just short of greatness  it will still have a place among pop culture and has certainly influenced the likes of paranormal activity
Dec 13 2012,negative,suck so bad youll want to shot yourself
Dec 11 2012,negative,while it did have some suspense the majority of the film was just a lame attempt at horror
Dec 11 2012,positive,i love this movie i think it was very well done obviously the only thing that can compare to it is the youtube series marble hornets slenderman series which i love as well 
Dec 9 2012,positive,heather i hear it  joshua i dont hear shit  heather did you hear that  45    the blair witch project is so terrifying and spinechilling its hard to imagine that you could make this film yourself with just a video camera a forest and a few friends this is easily the scariest film ive ever seen every sound i heard made me jump this is found footage at its best the script is also believable along with the acting giving it that extra bit of scariness you never see the blair witch in the film and your just left with a few eerie sounds and it is really effective      the blair witch project is a gem in the horror genre and easily one of the scariest films ever made and the horrific final act is something you wont forget very soon if you are a horror buff and you never seen this film what are you waiting for
Dec 9 2012,positive,brilliant and pioneering marketing campaign for a truly scary movie scares you with your own imagination instead of gratuitous cheap scares
Dec 8 2012,positive,i know a lot of people didnt like this movie but i do i thought the filmmaker accomplished a lot with very little most horror movies show too much of the monster diminishing how scary it is this movie is very suspenseful because the director knows how to make a good scary movie
Dec 8 2012,positive,when it came out it was one of the most original ideas in films of the decade
Dec 5 2012,positive,had to watch it a few times before i got the endingfollowed by me asking someone what the fuck the ending was about
Dec 5 2012,positive,has some very creepy moments that relies on atmosphere and a genuinely terrifying finale that works a lot better when watching it with the rest of the movie rather than just on youtube despite all the spoofing however there are some long periods of not much interesting or anything happening and the characters can sometimes get agitating even with that it at least works compared to some other found footage movies and i found myself thinking a lot about it after i watched it
Dec 4 2012,positive,genuine low budget genius the scary thing is you never even see the witch the blair witch lurks as she eyes up her freshest victims three aspiring college filmmakers focused on capturing some sort of video evidence of the blair witchs existence well they got it
Dec 4 2012,positive,i guess i just need to see to believe
Dec 4 2012,positive,simple idea put three people in the woods with a camera and turn it into a horror  it shouldnt work but it does and gets to the route of any good horror movie that it is not what you see its what you dont
Dec 2 2012,negative,so stupid but entertaining
Dec 1 2012,positive,a brilliant and truly horrifying exercise in film making you will either love or loath this film it is so clever it creeps up on you without you realising it staying with you for some time to come a true lesson in how to make a proper horror film
Nov 30 2012,positive,in all honesty this is one of my all time favorite horror moviesif not my favorite i have no idea why the stupid audience gave it a 47 i think what we cant see scares us the mostwell with me anyways i have just always adored this film and i have owned it for years nowi really dont think itll ever get old for me about to watch it now actually
Nov 30 2012,positive,genuinely scary but i wish they would have included more
Nov 30 2012,negative,this film is too overrated it starts off with very intriguingly however it painfully drags towards the end making it very hard to sit through i was expecting myself squirming in fear due to the positive responses towards it as the consensus says full of creepy campfire scares bleh i almost fell asleep at the second half of the movie the last scene was creepy though
Nov 25 2012,positive,the blair witch project was interesting horror movie like the omen and the shining
Nov 25 2012,positive,i dont give a damn for its time this one scared me
Nov 24 2012,positive,i saw this many years after its release so i am trying to judge it fairly based on what i think it might have been like to see it before it became completely cliche and obviously fake
Nov 24 2012,positive,super scary weak ending
Nov 22 2012,positive,its an iconic piece of film that stays with you long after its over
Nov 21 2012,positive,one of the first found footage movies made great atmosphere and audio the ending will go down in history
Nov 21 2012,negative,am i the only one that thought this film was shit watched it with two of my mates one was a complete wuss and even she wasnt scared watched it the whole way through and even though my other friend said it scared him and nothing scares him i found it boring and to be quite honest a waste of the time i spent watching it my friend who got scared said we obviously werent listening but i was and the suspense as people know it was not enough to scare me sorry but this was a poor excuse for a horror movie only reason i gave it one star was for the camera work and the actors the storyline lacked what it taked to make the audience fear and dread the ending
Nov 21 2012,negative,categorically unscary and nonsensical basically watching 3 idiots wander around some woods getting lost acting is poor to ok so unrealistic and unbelievable i really dont know why it became such a phenomenon and genre breaking
Nov 20 2012,positive,psychologically very creepy s
Nov 19 2012,negative,a friend and i tried for some nights to get in and see this but couldnt cause it was packed we did eventually and wished wed not bothered
Nov 18 2012,positive,good ass movieneed to see it
Nov 15 2012,positive,whacked out have you ever watched it while you were high
Nov 14 2012,positive,the film that spawned the popular found footage subgenre the blair witch project is undoubtedly one of the most important films in cinematic history this is not a film that belittles us with terrible effects it does not intend to make us jump and it is not interested in a cheap scare it is however a harrowing and innovative piece of cinema the horror comes from your own mind and it is what you make of it  my one piece of advice for watching this film is this watch it alone in the dark at night these are the conditions all horror is best suited to as it removes you from the constraints of a social situation and allows you to fully immerse yourself in the film and its world
Nov 14 2012,neutral,it was great until the ending
Nov 12 2012,positive,one of the best campy yes ultra cheap yet made so successful by a genius marketing campaign and use of the atthetime somewhat forgotten found footage genre one of in my mind the scarier films out there even if it didnt make me jump my first time seeing this was great love the unseen tormentor idea always have it works so well especially here
Nov 12 2012,positive,brilliant the scariest movie to ever show so little the blair witch project is innovative and genius at creating suspense and legitimate scares with no money
Nov 10 2012,positive,terror doesnt lie just in gore thats exactly what the blair witch project proves the performances are nearperfect the three teens lost in the woods act exactly like youd think they would the movie has plenty of scaremoments in it the only real letdown is that the movie ends very suddenly its never quite explained exactly what caused the supernatural events but thats all part of they mistery
Nov 10 2012,positive,it wasnt as scary as i thought it would be
Nov 9 2012,positive,how how they did it how could they scared the hell out of us almost giving us a heart attack with an ordinary scene where a man just stands on a dark corner applauses for daniel myrick and bob griffin
Nov 8 2012,positive,i remember when i saw this in theatre 13 years ago and it still has it moments especially in the final scene
Nov 7 2012,positive,i honestly dont know how to rate this movie i was so into it up until the ending which was so anticlimactic  lame that it pretty much ruined it for me up until that point though i was pretty entertained so i give this one a 35 such a shame
Nov 6 2012,negative,without any scares thrills or chills the blair witch project offers a promising second act but eventually leads to an abominable climax where youre left there having just wasted 1 hour 27 minutes of your life
Nov 5 2012,positive,definitely frightening unfortunately it started a found footage trend that has far exhausted itself many times over by now
Nov 5 2012,negative,maybe the hype wrecked it for me ill never get that time back
Nov 4 2012,positive,not necessarily a bad film of its time though paranormal activity has oversaturated the horror genre with this style too much now for me to review this film without thinking about this style negatively it revolutionized the horror genre and gave birth to the idea of using vague visual elements and realistic emotional tensions in comparison to the typical slasher overlyinnocent nature of most horror films still found today all of which copy off the other the one thing that really killed this film for me was the choice to make it a one hour and thirty minute film i understand that visual elements played a role throughout the film and gave it reason to be lengthen out but i truly feel that it could have been a 40min film theres only so much a person can take of a home video styled shaky camera before it becomes annoyingdry in emotion had it been a 40 minute short film i feel it could have gotten past being more of an anger management course video and been more successful at getting to the scary horror elements to me 34 of the film dragged on and on with little to keep it interesting except for some added visual symbols and repetitive arguments as the experience for the three characters turns for the worst the last 14 of it actually got to the good stuff but only for like 1015 minutes had the entire middle section of the film been shortened up it would have fit a whole lot better at least in my opinion that is
Nov 3 2012,positive,this is real terror
Nov 1 2012,negative,this is the movie version of the emperor with no clothes people love it because other people love it  but in reality its not scary  twigs hanging from trees arent scary someone plodding around a camp site isnt scary nothing in the movie is scary  its hard to watch because the viewer sees little  the story is flat
Nov 1 2012,positive,even this movie is fake its still a good movie  better then the 2nd one and just a good movie all around  some parts are still scary even thought ive seen this movie 100 times
Oct 31 2012,neutral,despite the awful acting this movie was very original and creepy
Oct 30 2012,positive,best moc doc scary films ever
Oct 29 2012,positive,psychological horror it is 
Oct 29 2012,negative,what a piece of 
Oct 28 2012,positive,way better than i ever thought it would be has inspired me to make my own film
Oct 28 2012,positive,pretty creepy almost positive the witch got them in the end
Oct 28 2012,positive,scared me shirtlessand shitless
Oct 27 2012,neutral,its an ambitious film for when it came out and i can admire it for that and its approach of trying to get scares out of what you dont see rather than what you do see but the filming style got on my nerves the buildup felt like it largely went nowhere the characters felt like they were just there to die and while the implications of the mythos were fascinating they never really seemed to take true advantage of them
Oct 27 2012,positive,three film students hike in the maryland woods to do a documentary on the local legend of the blair witch  rare horror that does provide some legitimate scares  proof a film can deliver on a razor thin budget
Oct 26 2012,positive,hate horror movies but this movie very good
Oct 26 2012,negative,highly overrated boring and not scary at all 15
Oct 26 2012,negative,its creepy at times but the blair witch project fails to delivery us with scares
Oct 26 2012,positive,initially terrifying but loses its impact after repeated viewings
Oct 25 2012,positive,one of my top 5 alltime favorite scary movies
Oct 24 2012,positive,good movie you keep on wondering throughout the movie if it was real
Oct 23 2012,positive,the blair witch project is a very chilling and very realistic foundfootage film that makes us imagine that the spooky moments in the film is the characters terror of encountering the endless woods and the blair witch
Oct 22 2012,positive,it was a pretty fun movie the acting wasnt terrible and the premise was fresh and different at the time
Oct 22 2012,positive,an ominous and chilling look into the fear of being lost and hunted by a darkness in the woods
Oct 22 2012,positive,pretty special when it was released
Oct 21 2012,negative,theyre in the woods  the camera keeps moving around  i guess theyre looking for some witch i dont know i wasnt listening  nothings happeningnothings happeningsomething about a map  nothings happeningits over  a lot of people in the audience look pissed    maybe the success of the blair witch project and the reinvention of the horror movie genre is a more interesting story than the actual movie its self
Oct 21 2012,positive,the blair witch project is a groundbreaking horror film that delivers truly terrifying scares  through recovered footage the film follows a group of three college students who disappeared while filming a documentary on the local legend of the blair witch  the footage is incredibly authentic and caused many to question whether it was actually real  the suspense and intensity is built up incredibly well and captures the terror and desperation of the characters  remarkably realistic and haunting the blair witch project is a daring visionary film that pioneered the found footage genre
Oct 20 2012,positive,honestly i would have liked this movie much better if it was titled under documentary instead of horror the unnerving tension and urgency of the film is remarkably felt the tangibility of this film is amazing and the feeling of remoteness is utterly vexing unfortunately this film just doesnt give horror justice
Oct 20 2012,positive,this review was initially going to be a 3 and a half stars one because i didnt quite liked the ending i felt a bit anticlimatic and it definetly didnt lived up to the great amout of tension and atmosphere the movie had built but after a lot of consideration i undestood that i felt that way beacuse i saw it just now on 2015 and that audiences were different on 1999 on that time this movie was truly innovative and the psicological terror it provoked was something not seen very often before thats why i think it deserves four stars
Oct 20 2012,positive,the beggining of a genre that lasted until now
Oct 20 2012,positive,a horror film for movie lovers it doesnt just scare you in the traditional sense it makes you think then freaks you out
Oct 19 2012,neutral,great idea and extremely innovative with that amateur style of film making but it failed to truly creep me out the acting was quite silly in my opinion and just dragged along they just tried to create an eerie atmosphere and seemed to build up to a great payoff but failed to do so
Oct 19 2012,positive,the trailblazer of found footage  viral marketing and shoestring budget horror blair witch deserves a place in the horror house of fame that doesnt make it a great movie while there are some very spooky scenes it meanders a lot both literally nausea inducing shaky cameras and figuratively
Oct 18 2012,positive,the blair witch project is a highly effective foundtape horror
Oct 18 2012,negative,half star from snot out of chicks nose this movie sucked realy bed
Oct 18 2012,negative,what a load of crap this movie is sooo stupid waste of time
Oct 17 2012,positive,sure this isnt the first foundfootage but its the one that popularized the genre to unbelievable levels with the tiniest budget and one very simple idea    whats scarier here is the power of suggestion you dont know if theres a real witch if theyre slowly going coocoo if theres people taunting them and everything works spectaculary thanks to some spontaneous devious moments that happen throughout from the little interviews in the beginning to small pieces of suggestion that happen during the movie    it can also be incredibly tense on the night scenes where the lofi quality of the cameras used make you question every shadow and every little log with a weird enough shape in the forest    i remembered i was a small kid when i watched this on the theatre and by then everyone believed this all really happened which is a testament to the masterminds behind it and to the talent of those unknow actors that carry the movie with believable enough actions
Oct 17 2012,positive,blair witch came into a stale movie genre and made it fresh exciting and of course scary less is more that is what made this movie so iconic
Oct 17 2012,negative,one of the worse movies ever
Oct 15 2012,positive,before the internet hit fullstride film marketing was a completely different concept film trailers were around to preview movies to the masses but the likes of viral marketing campaigns online speculation and teasers for teaser trailers were rare if existant at all instead films were marketed for what they were no tricks involved thats why the release of the blair witch project in 1999 had such an impact on film marketing using a website that documented mythology of the titular blair witch trailers that hinted at the films footage being completely real and reports that the actors in the film were missing and presumed dead audiences were instantly attracted to the tiny indie films mysterious nature and uncertainty regarding the reality of its story this all goes without noting how utterly terrifying the blair witch project truly is using tactics that distance itself from most other horror movies old and new    the blair witch project follows the story hinted at throughout the films massive marketing campaign planning on shooting a documentary about burkittsville marylands fabled blair witch three film students heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams set out to prove the existence of the blair witch in october of 1994 interviews with locals before the actual search fare mixed opinions on the subject ranging from citizens who completely deny the fable to locals who explain in detail how a hermit named rustin parr kidnapped tortured and murdered children    after wrapping up enough footage to use for the documentarys opening scene and introductory statements the three students head into the woods of north burkittsville to hopefully catch proof of the blair witch for their film however it doesnt take long for the three inexperienced hikers to find themselves lost and traveling in circles of course it also doesnt help that an unseen entity continually harasses heather josh and mike during the night leaving only mysterious rock formations and stick figures as evidence its safe to say that the production of the harmless documentary soon turns into the worst experience of the three filmmakers lives    while rumors of the film showing real footage were shot down the movie creates an atmosphere that certainly accounts for the rumors this mostly comes from the fact that the film had no script in most cases that would result in an instant failure but in the case of the blair witch project it plays heavily in its favor using only a 68 page outline and a custom made mythology devised from old history such as a 16th century mystic the films dialogue was completely improvised by the actors this makes an already relatable concept of being lost in the woods with no sense of direction all the more realistic    of course a script that relies on improvisation requires strong improvisation skills from its actors and in that regard the blair witch project succeeds masterfully the actors who all used their real names all seem to have genuine reactions to the events around them as the horrors continuously escalate when they finish filming their introduction they seem genuinely happy when they find themselves going in circles they seem genuinely angry when they stumble across the famous stick figures they seem genuinely terrified easily the most wellacted scene comes in the instantly recognizable scene where heather gives her famous monologue the fear is easily seen in her tearfilled eyes and stuttering voice as she struggles to apologize for her actions    some of the credit for such genuine reactions has to go to the directors eduardo sanchez and daniel myrick using various means sanchez and myrick pushed their actors to their limits in order to get the best reactions possible for example when the actors slept the two directors would purposely sabotage the actors food and create some strife among them which played out in the next scene the real directorial success however is how the titular blair witch is never actually seen on screen the result is a much more horrifying film forcing the viewer to use only the sounds around the characters and their own imaginations to realize just what is tormenting these three students this tactic separates itself from most other horror movies quite successfully especially in the heartstopping finale    filmed on a budget of less than 1 million the blair witch project went on to gross over 248 million worldwide earning it a world record for top budget to box office ratio such a huge success is a bright spot in the films life as it stands as one of the most inventive as well as one of the most terrifying movies of all time with interesting lore extremely welldone improvised acting by the trio of actors and smart directing choices the blair witch project is sure to change your mind about the woods behind your house and what may be lurking within
Oct 13 2012,negative,complete tripe can i have those to hours back
Oct 11 2012,positive,the film that redefined cinema who knew showing so little could scare you so much
Oct 11 2012,negative,its scary if you are afraid of a constant barrage of expletives
Oct 9 2012,negative,one of the most infamous horror film that started the whole mockumentary genre and also inspired the popular but really crappy paranormal activity its confusing and not frightening at all i cant believe this junk actually made people believe that these stupid actors were actually killed by the so called blair witch
Oct 9 2012,negative,overhyped and not scary though this is an essential film that sparked the found footage genre i suggest you view it in that sense and overlook the dry boring story of lost maps and invisible witches
Oct 9 2012,positive,extremely innovative and intense
Oct 6 2012,positive,has some very creepy moments that relies on atmosphere and a genuinely terrifying finale that works a lot better when watching it with the rest of the movie rather than just on youtube despite all the spoofing however there are some long periods of not much interesting or anything happening and the characters can sometimes get agitating even with that it at least works compared to some other found footage movies and i found myself thinking a lot about it after i watched it
Oct 5 2012,positive,great piece of indie cinema i personally didnt find it scary but it maintains a tense creepy atmosphere whcih it favours over jump scares
Oct 5 2012,positive,come to think of it it is a really neat idea to have this all filmed in firstperson like a documentary or something i hope they dont overuse it oh those poor suckers in 1999 had no idea what was about to happen admittedly ten years later after paranormal activity came along but was still on its way yes people we now come to the film that started it all and i can think of plenty of people who wish they had put it down when they had a chance not necessarily because plenty of people wish that the found footage craze never came along because come on we had to get cloverfield somehow but because this films hype died on its feet after a while hey i dont know about yall but yeah i pretty much agree that this film isnt as good as many people said it was a couple of years ago but hey i felt myself slipping into the heat of the tension though that might just be some kind of natural connection with this michael c williams dude seeing as how we have the same birthday or do we this film is so enwrapped with so much mystery suspense and intrigue that i dont know what to believe anymore but enough about a better psychological horror film no but seriously though about the only reason why im having trouble discerning reality from fiction is because this film doesnt make for the most convincing faux documentary nor all that especially watchable of a film to begin with which isnt to say that this film is ever bad not just because its too mediocre to be bad but because its not like its not without a few undeniable strengths or if nothing else commendable ambitions    the overall story  such as it is  premise of three people falling apart as evil forces ensue upon them during their entrapment in an isolated environment isnt particularly unique yet the concept does have a certain level of intrigue to it that immediately carries over into this film maybe not enough to save it enough from mediocrity but enough to keep it from getting tedious and it helps that the defining theme behind this not so unique premise is anything but not unique regardless of how some make it seem this film was not at all the first big found footage film yet it was certainly something of a pioneer of the genre as we now know it and you can say what you want about the genre because lord knows i have a thing or two to say about it but at the end of the day its still a pretty neat idea and is just that here because although this story is lacking in the way of originality its found footage firstperson perspective style breathes into a bit more uniqueness and with that uniqueness more intrigue now as ill touch more upon later all of this intrigue goes undercut quite tremendously by the natural flaws within the found footage format among many other things yet there is still enough in there to keep the film from getting too disengaging with a bit of help coming from those in front of and quite literally directly behind the camera now dont get me wrong while i dont find the performances as underwhelming as many say our leads performances are no better than decent partially because not much material is provided with what material that is provided going undercut by obnoxiousness good screams and anxious heavy breathing but seriously do these people seriously have to be doing it this often yet the fact of the matter is that our performers do keep things going to one degree or another whether it be with charisma or emotional range and even a few layers again the performances arent especially upstanding yet at least theres something of a consistent bite to them and that all but alone produces a kind of atmosphere that leaves you to bond with this environment and stick with the characters this film would be in every sense of the word nothing without yes people with all of this films faults  of which there are oh so many  that im about to touch upon it has its share of strengths that keep it from descending too low yet neither do they carry it too far ive my share of compliments to throw at the film yet when its all said and done those strengths go undercut by what this film gets wrong to where the only thing that i can think of that truly saves this film and makes it not too difficult of a watch is simply its being just too mediocre and bland for its own good even when it comes to the unique theme    see you found footage kids nowadays  who are only ten years younger than this films generation of found footage kids  dont realize how relatively good youve got it what with all of your special effects and hd cameras that your regular joe schmo of a wanna be documentariant isnt likely to pick up so easily and whatnot because with this film they really do go all out with presenting this film like an amateurishly shot casual production to where it both adds and detracts from the films intrigue for although this format graces this film with some uniqueness it also knocks you out of the film sure theres more atmosphere to this film then there are in other films on this level of overrealistic yet not enough to dissipate considerable blandness that dilutes your ability to fully buy into this film as its own world and it doesnt help that heather donahues well heather donahue characters keeping the camera going is nothing short of farfetched donahue can go on and on with all of her its all i have left bull but really its hard to not agree with donahues castmates when they tell her time and again to turn the stupid camera off as the only excuse for this films excessive filming that i can think of is the fact that there wouldnt be much of a story if donahue were to just turn off the camera and even then its not like theres too much of a story to begin with because ladies and gentlemen when you get down to it the real problem with the film is that it is all but devoid of narrative structure simply drifting along with no rise or fall just reasonably wellplayed yet obnoxious people doing whatever for 80 minutes and believe me that gets old quite fast in this paceless film the film is exceedingly repetitious with no real momentum and never really seems to go anywhere which would be easier to forgive were it not for the fact that this film isnt even all that effective of a horror film for although there is a certain aura of uneasiness within the atmosphere nothing scary happens for there is so very little in the way of true consequential conflict and what few conflictory events that are present within the film fall flat i kid not when i say that it wasnt very long at all into this films body before  even with all of the ineffective creepy happenings  i completely forgot about this films titular antagonist and even true conflict altogether or at least not until the end where things pick up for a moment so brief its borderline amusing because when things finally go down it cant be but like not even ten minutes before things really do go down to a crowbarred copout of nonending that is if you even want to call it that seeing as how a copout ending insuinates that there was both or at least either compellingness or plot within this film there is no real plot to the film and certainly not enough compensation for that only a lack of conflict and structure as well as an abundance of repetition to where the film is rendered so bland that about the only reason why this film isnt bad is because it never has the guts to be bland yet doesnt fall short in providing a certain charm to its mediocrity still make no mistake this is a very mediocre film at the end of the day with literally nothing to turn you or at least me off yet still also nothing rewarding at the same time thus making for a forgettably superfluous final product that does indeed let you know what were in for with the found footage horror genre    in the copout of an end the films story premise  however limited and uninventive it may be  has a certain intrigue to it intensified by a unique style and a trio of albeit obnoxiously written yet reasonably charming and at times pretty decent performances thus securing the film from a descent beneath contempt established by a certain charm to the films mediocrity which at the same time is why this film falls so flat for although the film isnt tedious its themes are distancingly bland though not as much as the narrative  such as it is  which is so structureless and by extension pacelessly repetitious and so devoid of scares as well as even short on conflict for that matter that it creates an intensely bland plotlessness that never abates and ultimately leaves the blair witch project to fall flat as a forgettably undrewarding misfire with nothing to hate but nothing to embrace just ceasless pure mediocrity    25  medicore
Oct 4 2012,positive,i have watched this film half a dozen times and i take pride in this considering i didnt much liked it the first time around i had no problem with the abrupt ending but i was enormously disappointed with the total lack of scares   still i found myself returning again and again and it slowly dawned on me  whisper it softlyits not about the scares boo   of course some people found it scary but it takes all kinds right what now satisfies me so much is first and foremost the cast heather donahue is a treat and joshua leonard and michael williams arent bad either all very believable more impressive is the subtle yet peculiar cast of townspeople some of them actors some notthe scene with the baby bursting in tears and trying to cover mamas mouth while she tells our doomed protagonists about the blair witch will stay with me for a long time and i dont mind  partly improvised the overall feeling is hateitorloveit and i dont think theres a movie more fitting to that term  my opinion this is a barrierbreaking hugely influential milestone in indie filmaking with a deep sense of character
Oct 3 2012,negative,i did what i normally do when i watch a horror and that is sit alone in the dark with headphones on its the perfect way to watch a scary movie as you feel isolated and cut off from everything around you but this garbage didnt make me flicker or quiver one bit this is the biggest pile of rubbish in cinematic history imagination my ass this villain that hides in the darkness that we never get to see is laughable i laugh at people that find this nonsense scary nothing happens fact the blair witch project starts off with a decent build up and well constructed characters but eventually descends into a totally scarefree found footage horror with camerawork so shaky its annoying because you cant see whats going on but you dont miss anything cause nothing goes on in these woods the characters begin to get increasingly irritating with all the bad language and shouting and the ending is one of the worst movie endings in my recent memory no atmosphere no jumpy moments the mythlegend of the blair witch is absent its just a bunch of sticks and rocks appearing every once in a while the ending is terrible the camera shows a man standing in the corner the girl screams she falls over the end this must be some kind of joke movie a big fat waste of time how this movie made over 250000000 at the box office is beyond me the audience mustve been desperate to watch anything
Oct 3 2012,negative,shitty movie i would never watch it again
Sep 29 2012,positive,so reallooking and raw that it scares the shit out of the most hardcore horror fan
Sep 28 2012,positive,only con is its not worth watching more than once
Sep 27 2012,positive,i should start by saying that my opinion of this film is clouded by a great holiday in the us during which i first watched it  anyway as most people will know by now the film was shot on a low budget and its intention is to scare so avoid it if youre prone to vivid nightmares    the film starts by explaining that three students went to the woods to investigate the blair witch incidents  the students disappeared but the film you are about to watch is what was recovered from their equipment  as is often the case with such films there isnt a lot of action but the tension is pumped up by spooky shots of the surrounding woods and unexplained noises  im not a believer in vodoo and witchcraft so in theory there was nothing to scare me but i have to admit to being frightened occasionally by the film  thankfully not enough to disrupt my sleep though
Sep 26 2012,positive,makes you not want to go walking around in the woods for very long
Sep 26 2012,positive,i dont care what anyone says about this movie i would never watch it alone in the dark
Sep 26 2012,positive,never bought the hype back in the day but it was a pretty scary movie
Sep 26 2012,positive,im so scared right nowlol best ever
Sep 24 2012,negative,hate this movieterriblestay away
Sep 24 2012,negative,only thing scary about this film is the camera work
Sep 23 2012,negative,i saw this while baby sitting a 1 year old i was freaked out
Sep 23 2012,positive,this is pure horror
Sep 22 2012,neutral,the amount of crap i slung at the blair witch project in my review may have been misleading  i dont think this is a bad movie i just dont think its aged well  when it came out i remember loving it  but since then ive seen too many better made found footage movies and even some that actually have things happening on camera in them  looking at it now theres next to no story its grainy and ugly to look at and the performances get on my nerves  all that being said i still think this movie deserves a little bit of respect for making the found footage genre that is a guilty pleasure for me a mainstream genre  but you can still probably skip it  full review at 
Sep 22 2012,negative,starts out creepy enough but quickly descends into a boringly trite and suspensefree ripoff of cannibal holocaust it also does not help that the three students are ultrawhiney and complete idiots i have trouble sympathizing with characters that get lost in a forest despite possessing a compass and a map     similar to paranormal activity where most of the scare tactics comprise of repetitive teasing that has little to underwhelming payoffs it also contains one of the lamest endings to a film ever     in the end this horror schlock is more famous for its gimmicky truestory marketing and foundfootage style which was cuttingedge for the time before it was overused thanks to the popularity of this film and paranormal activity than as a quality piece of cinema
Sep 22 2012,positive,an amazingly unique and incredibly realistic horror film which packs in such powerful scares with little techniques such as shadows and screams warning not for those who get motion sickness
Sep 20 2012,positive,if you dont think this film is scary youve got no imagination
Sep 20 2012,positive,as a child i wasnt very impressed or scared but as an adult i was absolutely positively creeped out to the fullest extent its interesting that it worked out that way movies that scared the shit out of me as a kid were films like the ring because it had very disturbing images that stuck in my head for months and infiltrated my nightmares nothing you see in the blair witch project is really that disturbing ultimately the movie leaves it to your imagination to scare the living hell out of you and succeeds it does in my opinion and that is truly why the blair witch project is a brilliant film
Sep 19 2012,negative,i thought this was the stupidest movie ever
Sep 19 2012,positive,scary really   
Sep 18 2012,positive,i was constantly on the edge of my seat thoughout
Sep 18 2012,negative,1999 was my favorite year in film
Sep 16 2012,positive,scaryreal scary
Sep 15 2012,positive,i thought this was a true story the first time that i saw itbefore they came out with it being a hoax so it really scared me
Sep 15 2012,positive,this is a very well known movie in the horror genre that i think we have to thank for the shaky camera technique  i recall hearing of people getting sick from the camerawork or lack of it  i wish i had seen this back when it was in its original run in theaters  it probably would have been more effective  nothing really happens other than the characters get lost and one of them disappears  the surprising thing is that it actually has effective moments  when the characters are in the dark and their flashlights dimmed the scares were there  but true to form nothing happens  all of the scares are generated by a fear of the unknown  unfortunately blair witch carries it a little too far  i am not advocating the need for gore in this movie there is none other than the main character finding some recently extracted teeth presumably from the character that had disappeared  it just needed a little something  someone moving in the woods a brief glance at a shadowy figure  something more than little piles of rocks and stickmen hanging in trees  much is left open for interpretation especially the ending  its frustrating  spoiler i think the fact that mike is standing in the corner of the basement in the old house is a callback to an earlier moment in the movie which tells of victims being made to stand in a corner while someone is murdered in the same room  that implies the main character who sees mike standing in the corner is going to be killedi think  end spoiler
Sep 15 2012,positive,the greatest horror movie of all time
Sep 13 2012,negative,worst moive i ever saw wait of time
Sep 10 2012,positive,while the camera work might get you motion sick the plot and originality are top notch
Sep 10 2012,positive,with only spending around 7000 dollars this is a great made movie
Sep 10 2012,positive,inventive and exciting without special effects or cheap gags  this is a masterpiece and a landmark
Sep 9 2012,positive,extremely good acting and well designed but ultimately it built up to an unsatisfying finale
Sep 7 2012,negative,i got motion sick eww
Sep 4 2012,positive,this has to be my favorite horror movie not because the ending scared me or because there were great special effects but because it is an example of great filmmaking it is incredibly believable it is subtle there is no bombastic music while the shaky cam might make some dizzy i did not find it overpowering this movie was lovingly made and it shows it stands on its own as a film and has far more class than what i have seen of its self created subgenre
Sep 3 2012,positive,the original found footage film
Sep 3 2012,positive,only the unknown frightens men but once a man has faced the unknown that terror becomes the known  antoine de saintexupery
Sep 2 2012,negative,left the theatre pissed that day
Sep 2 2012,negative,this is the most ridiculous movies i ever wasted money and time on i wish it would have been better instead of just getting good at the end when the chick dies going down the stairs
Sep 1 2012,negative,very good yet you dont see the blair witch 
Aug 29 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this because of the acting i also thought the scares were pretty decent
Aug 28 2012,positive,probably one of the scariest thing that ever happened in the big screen but definitely the scariest the 90s ever gave
Aug 28 2012,negative,one of the most overrated films ever
Aug 28 2012,positive,so scary because its true
Aug 27 2012,positive,it scared me so bad
Aug 26 2012,positive,you may get motion sickness watching this movie but its totally creepy
Aug 25 2012,positive,its an interesting concept butin all honesty watching this film feels more like a guy who is on a roller coaster though who is filming it i really felt sick in this film because of the camera work when it first went a little shaky i didnt think any thing of itin all honesty i looked at it as away to get the viewer in groused in the film but after they started to happen over and over it felt almost like the cameraman had parkinson or something and couldnt help but shake the camerait wasntbad but it def distracted you from the film and in all honesty im glad this film wasnt released in 3d if it was i wouldve def gotten motion sickness     that aside the rest of the film is pretty goodespecially considering that it was shot in just over a week in total and it does an interesting job in giving you fear watching the film and not actually seeing the enemyantagonist in the film it really reminded me of halloween and how it was a low budget film and in the end did really really wellespecially since some of the film was shot in black in white all in ll i think this film is okay butthe camera work really makes it hard to enjoy the film
Aug 25 2012,positive,this is the most realistic scary movie ever
Aug 25 2012,positive,a it isnt scary or suspensful but what i admire of this film is the bravura  of creatng a new genre of horror that can be truly creepy
Aug 24 2012,positive,say what you will i like this movie
Aug 23 2012,positive,great movie so much done with so little
Aug 23 2012,negative,i dont care about continuity errors either way its boring old crap
Aug 21 2012,positive,the blair witch project is a movie to commend but at the same time its a movie to condemn why do i say this well let me explain how have horror movies changed in the last 10 years most horror movies we see in todays age specifically being distributed out of the united states contain a foundfootage style production it seems like every movie we see nowadays is shot in this specific style there is an obvious reason as to why this is if you shoot a movie in this style you save a considerable amount of money and for some reason audiences buy into this style of production so they go and see it the cost of production reduces considerably and the revenue at the box office skyrockets to me this is simple marketing and it has completely ruined the horror industry in america the blair witch project was really one of the first movies to take on this specific style it is a pioneer of this subgenre of horror and thats commendable but its also something to resent because its created a whole list of films that are absolutely horrible in this specifc subgenre the first movie of this kind was the only one that was truly able to master its technique thats because this film didnt have an economic agenda to it its whole goal was to freak you out its too bad that horror films have been reduced to simple moneymakers now you cant blame it all on daneil myrick and bob griffins film though its not as if they knew this was going to happen if you pretend that all of the unholy ripoffs that this single film spawned youll notice that this movie alone is a pretty decent horror film     a bunch of teenagers go into the wilderness because they are interested on researching the blair witch basically a bunch of stuff goes down and its all caught on camera now to you and me this sounds extremely boring why well like i said earlier its now been done maybe 100 times but in 1999 this was a new thing to see so ill commend the films idea and the way that its executed for its time it certainly was original     the one thing that really did bring this film down in its quality was the acting basically what the people in charge of the production were trying to do was make this movie seem as real as possible so they obviously hired a bunch of unknown actors and this is fine but i dont understand why some people think that a nonconventional way to go about acting makes things more realistic it doesnt bad acting and improvisation dont make a movie seem like not a movie great acting makes audiences feel as if they arent really watching a movie poor acting makes them remember that on all levels this film had extremely poor acting everyone was bad and i mean everyone that was disappointing to see but thank god the performances werent what dominated this movie so it didnt bring down the quality that much     the blair witch projectis shot extremely simply just as i said earlier what makes this movie different from all of its ripoffs is that its actually shot on cheap equipment what production companies try to do now is simulate a raw style of production when in fact the cameras that are being used are extremely sophisticated this film doesnt try to trick you in that department its crude its raw and thats what makes it scary     i cant really explain anything else without giving the film away let me just say that this film was pretty well done its hard to look on this film the same way that i would have in 1999 but when viewing it i tried to be as fair as possible the producers of this film must be shaking their heads at what horror films have become in the last 1012 years i certainly have you cant really rely on the united states to give you a good horror movie anymore theres no one out there who truely has a passion to freak people out i have to look to foreign films to get my scares but even though this subject really makes me mad you have to tip your cap to this movie for better or for worse the blair witch project is a pioneer in the history of horror and though it might be a pionner of garbage its a pioneer nontheless and thats something to respect
Aug 18 2012,positive,directed by daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez the blair witch project is a lowbudget foundfootage horror film that follows the story of three students when they go missing in the woods of maryland a place haunted by the local legend  the blair witch      with the horror subgenre of foundfootage being shoved into the limelight an inevitable surge of halfhearted horror flicks have been dumped onto our cinema screens their lack of funding care and attention have slowly turned this subgenre into a joke worthy of countless numbers of spoofs when this is the case one would ask then why do companies produce these films for which my answer would be 1 the cost of production is so low its worth the risk a profit will almost definitely be made and 2 they are essentially attempting to recreate the success of the highly acclaimed blair witch project from where foundfootage became a phenomenon capitalising on the common yet usually effective convention of bringing an urban myth to life the blair witch project is a fine example of foundfootage done right     the blair witch a daunting yet seemingly invisible enemy that claims  the lives and sanity of anyone that dares to enter her wooded domain a totally original highly terrifying and utterly convincing concept created by the hands of two independent filmmakers so convincing in fact that at the time of release audiences and critics alike were unsure of its legitimacy this prominent thirst for originality is where the film truly excels initially presented as a mockumentory in the form of a studentproject this linear storyline is essential to this films success knowing that this films strength lies in the clever terror of the deceiving forest the characters intelligently procrastinate in the safety of the village gathering reported sightings from the all too realistic villagers substantially increasing the tension as they enter the desolate forest with our knowledge limited to the confines of the characters discoveries we as the audience find ourselves in an all too relate able situation to the one on screen we know just as much as they do about this paranormal witch the terrain is just as disorientating to them as it is to us and we want to escape this haunting nightmare too     subsequently these characters become all too realistic the concept of being faced with such a situation deeply disturbs even the most psychologically secured audience members and therefore creates the mindset in order to heavily support these characters as they desperately search for escape this total devotion to the characters involved is mainly due to the fact that all three actors are completely unknown heather donahue  joshua leonard and michael williams each provide fantastic performances that allow the audience to become fully enthralled within their character this feat of realism wouldnt be the same without these three actors     despite the lack of funding the total amount of effort that has been inserted into producing this film is undeniably outstanding from the most obvious of directorial feats to the tiny titbits of filming these two directors did as much as they could in order to produce an impeccable final product to inject even more realism into the film actors were given a simple script from which they were told to improvise efforts go from actions as important as that to almost triviatype clever facts like the use of the actual names of the actors for the characters within the film     perhaps the only major problem i have with this film materialises at its climax the characters had been following a seemingly never ending trail haunted by the witch at night causing paranoia to seep in just as we become completely engulfed within the film and were on the edge of our seats frantically scrambling our brain for a possible outcome the credits roll ah concluded among some as one of the best endings of all time i couldnt help but feel left wanting more it was disappointing to see the tension in the film increasing to an unbearable stage for it to just vanish in an anticlimactic lazy ending the ending just about suffices  making sense and providing a fairly clever outcome that revisits knowledge gained previously in the film however it is very abrupt and sudden unable to provide a visible outcome to the characters usually such an ending would be brilliant piecing together the story for yourself however to allow for such an ending an adequate amount of information must be given beforehand this lack of information coincidentally leaves you underwhelmed     the blair witch project has totally transformed the way foundfootage films are perceived  its clever terrifying original and relateable its just unfortunate that no subsequent foundfootage films has been able to replicate such an achievement     80 ripping up the conventions of horror and painting on a fresh canvas with the colours of originality very intelligent and very scary    calum russell
Aug 16 2012,positive,wonderfully horrifying
Aug 15 2012,positive,pretty cool idea  the realism made it scary
Aug 14 2012,positive,this movie is an origonal masterpeice that will change cinema forever this movie is creative and inventive they way the actors play off of eachothers emotions well there in the miskis of beging terrorised by something is perfect you really beging to get into the movie as you hear stories about the witch from the town people you feel like a kid around a camp fire getting told a scary story about a witch that kills little kids then as you beging to hear the noises and see the things and hear the little kids laughing you beging to feel like its not just a story anymore the ending of the movie is perfect it leaves you with the shot beging unknown but you yourself know what is about to happen its like the old horror movies its what you dont see what scares you you to as an audiance begin to lose your mind as the characters do as well because you are just as confused as they are as they walk for hours and never get any closer neither do you until the end when as there greatest fear comes true yours does as well as the movie is shot threw there eyes you become them almost so you feel what they feel this movie is perfect
Aug 14 2012,positive,this movie promised something initially at first i was skeptical to watch another first person horror and im still skeptical this movie built suspense higher than many other movies ive seen but ends in absolute failure i never felt scared either
Aug 14 2012,positive,watched this on my own in the dark and it spooked me a lot
Aug 13 2012,neutral,only saw a bit of this but what i saw was pretty freaky
Aug 11 2012,positive,for the first foundfootage genre film this is one unforgettable film
Aug 11 2012,positive,surprised that so many peoples attention spans cant handle thisoh wait sorry i forgot that i was living in america go back to your the last exorcism horsecrap you sheep you
Aug 10 2012,positive,for some people this movie is underated some think that its overrated i think it is underated the blair witch project is very creepy this movie makes some people want to stay inside i wished it would be scarier though b
Aug 10 2012,positive,a curiosity piece that turned into an unimaginable phenomenon upon its initial release this horror pic is a bittersweet affair the constant shaking of the camera boarders on nauseating but at least the performances from the three natural leads heather donahue joshua leonard and michael c williams using their real names here are quite powerful and effectively convey their frightening experiences throughout the climax which sees heather and michael in an abandoned house is genuinely terrifying stuff although overrated the blair witch project is wellworth watching     followed by book of shadows blair witch 2 2000
Aug 10 2012,positive,i didnt know anything about this film when i went to the cinema but i got it into my head that the footage was real so because i thought it was real i got stuck into it the film scared me more than any horror has ever done and ive seen alot of horror films it did its job then but now i know better it doesnt do anything for me im glad i seen it for the first time believing it real
Aug 10 2012,positive,i know many people who despise this movie and i always explain to them why i find it so intelligent when are we gonna see the witch i truly believe that hand held camera movies create a more intense and realistic atmosphere and give the impression of true story elements i think that your imagination can brew up something far more terrifying than what special effects couldve given you ghostly noises sounds and the characters personal account feed the imagination such knowledge as to impose their unseen villain for the audiences own interpretation when are you gonna see the witch i saw her at least 4 times throughout the movie but not by using my eyes
Aug 9 2012,positive,this is where all horrible found footage movies spawned from
Aug 9 2012,positive,the blaire witch project is one of the first armature camera movies i saw sure its unique and its one of those horror films that get more frightening as you watch to the end
Aug 8 2012,positive,  a brilliant horror film the scares were on its simplest but amplified by our imaginations that run wild because of its enigmatic appearance
Aug 8 2012,positive,its ok but its not as good as people say it is
Aug 6 2012,negative,this movie stunk in spite of its good suspense the scare just wasnt there i was very disappointed anyone who thinks this is a god horror flick needs to rethink their tastes
Aug 6 2012,positive,when this came out my mom thought it was really stupid and i guess her opinion really influenced me in my young years because i went into the blair witch at age 12 or 13 with that attitude and came out with the same opinion i just got done watching it for the second time at age 20 now and this may be one of the most brilliant horror films ive ever seen i couldnt appreciate it when i was younger for whatever reason the blair witch project is an extremely important movie for a number of reasons 1 i could be wrong but i think this is the first found footage film ever 2 since it was the first of its kind they were actually able to market the movie as real footage and it scared the shiittt out of everyone that saw it in theaters those first few weeks and 3 just as the consensus on rt says it proves that our imagination is way scarier than things we actually see literally all you see is some sticks made into human figures rocks in piles and one glimpse at some small bloody body parts you literally dont see anything but the three peoples descent into madness and it makes it pretty fucking scary that its all left to our imagination a brilliant little film that is a landmark in horror film history
Aug 4 2012,negative,creeped me out till i found out it was staged
Aug 4 2012,positive,it was coolwhen i first watched it cuz it seemed so real and the end was scarier than sht
Aug 4 2012,positive,while innovative and welldefining of a film genre found footage that needed to be made blair witchs terror lessens as fear of what we dont see continues to the ending that is slightly unsatisfying
Aug 4 2012,positive,a terrifying movie that leaves the audience with more questions than answers
Aug 3 2012,neutral,in 2012 with improved found footage films and scarier ones such as paranormal activity i felt this was a poor film that teases with the brain but never scares you i felt thus would of been much scarier in 1999 but in 2012 i felt it was just an average film
Aug 1 2012,positive,one of the scariest movies ive ever laid eyes on say what you will about it not being scary youre just one of those people trying to act tough in front of your friends you cant tell me that if this was happening to you that you would sit there in your tent saying this isnt scary or because i dont see an actual ghost its not scary to me all of you who say those things are full of it i guess you just prefer a masked killer going around chopping people into dog food now thats terrifying end sarcasm
Jul 31 2012,negative,being a young child back in 1999 i barely remember people talking about this film watched it some year or two after its vhs release  was quite disappointed everything seems so confusing its hard to be scared at least this film reintroduced the found footage genre for horror films
Jul 31 2012,negative,nah did not scare me atall
Jul 29 2012,positive,blair witch project is the first of the found footage films it does well story is well told its a little slow but it picks up ending is disappointing but besides that its good
Jul 27 2012,positive,ok so this is the film everyones claiming to be scary as hell i was a little kid when this film was released now i couldnt resist to watch the movie after all of its critical acclaim so i rented it a couple of days ago and finally watched it and after the credits rolled i was feeling a little bit strange  combining hi8 video with blackandwhite 16 mm film this film presents a raw look at what can happen when college students forego common sense and enter the world of voodoo and witchcraft presented as a straightforward documentary the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994 three students went into the maryland back woods to do a film project on the blair witch incidents these kids were never seen again and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment found in the woods a year later the entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes  first of all this film was great without doubt in terms of plot acting and storyline and it had one of the best marketings ive ever seen since the devil insides but in the terror area i was dissapointed the films purpose is to make you think of what is happening lacking real scares which for some may work but for me i dont want to use my imagination for seeing a horror movie and the ending wasnt great nor it was awfull but somehow it lets you down   although i was dissapointed by this movie in the scary section i shall recognize the dark atmosphere of the movie because really who wont be scared of being trapped in a forest in the middle of the night knowing someone is haunting you and you have no other choice but to accept your fate and die in there now thats scary   as for the film overall despite the dark atmosphere the superb acting the misterious plot and the creepy storyline i cant help but think that ive seen the incorrect horror movie because really this film was that dissapointing for me
Jul 26 2012,positive,start of the low budget  reality films like paranormal activity thought it was a little overhyped for being scary but it did succeed in keeping my attention for watching the story develop
Jul 26 2012,negative,this is a movie about three college kids who go into the woods with a camera to explore the origins of a small town urban legend and it is aggravatingly boring  first the kids get bored frustrated then cranky and then are reduced to blubbering messes as a result of randomly appearing stacks of rocks  during the boredom frustration and cranky stages as an audience member i could relate but not in a good way  the film relies heavily on improvisation on the actors part and its quite apparent as all the dialogue feels forced  the only apparent threat is the overwhelming annoyance of the main characters and by the time they finally meet their fates it is tremendously overdue
Jul 26 2012,positive,love it or hate it you cant deny its originality and the beauty of its simplicity
Jul 24 2012,positive,scared the hell out of me lol
Jul 23 2012,positive,this movie is like the haunting it shows how just the smallest things can make you  scared that independent and home video feel to the movie makes this a truly different experience the ending will leave you curious confused and especially scared out of your wits it makes you wonder what really happened to those people also the curiosity of who or what killed them is truly up to the viewer and it is your imagination
Jul 23 2012,positive,found footage started here for better or worse this one rocked it
Jul 23 2012,positive,deserves more credit than it got just for pulling the wool over so many eyes
Jul 21 2012,positive,a    i love this movie so much it is scary suspenseful and just fun to watch i was terrified by the end of the movie
Jul 21 2012,negative,this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen i watched it years after it came out and just plain dont understand the hype it was moderately creepy and ended on a very unsatisfactory note most of the time its just a bunch of kids walking through the woods so its not satisfying during the rest of the movie either
Jul 19 2012,positive,this was very scary a unique formula tell the audience this is based on real events and the people in here are just tracing what could have happened to a particular troupe  mind blowing concept
Jul 19 2012,positive,this movie just proved that we are even more scared of everything that is unseen one of the creepiest movie i ever watched and theres almost nothing that were used to see in the clich√© horror movies even if the acting was sometimes a little weak the plot was good and this movie was awfully effective
Jul 18 2012,positive,although it might seem sluggish to some the whole thing is fascinating and incredibly realistic the concept is simple but powerful and the movie shifts from fun joyride to riveting drama to shocking horror    its surprising that nobody in this movie got nominated for an oscar considering how realistic they were in extremely demanding roles in the end the movies not full out scary but its creepy and gut wrenching and really makes you feel for the three students i had trouble sleeping afterward even though i was long way away from any woods
Jul 18 2012,negative,it was just soooo bad
Jul 17 2012,negative,plot is important to me in movies im not satisfied with mediocre acting cheap thrills and nonstop explosions  unfortunately this film had basically no plot it didnt even have cheap thrills or explosions
Jul 16 2012,positive,whats scarier than the blair witch project is your imagination
Jul 16 2012,negative,wow it sucked its boring too
Jul 16 2012,positive,three students went out into the wilderness to shoot a documentary about the infamous blair witch and were never seen again a year later their footage is released for the public to see the first film to spawn the currently popular foundfootage subgenre the blair witch project is not only one of the scariest films of this generation but also an incredible filmmaking achievement with a barebones budget unknown actors no music no violence and a standard video camera directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez proved that you can still chill the blood and make a load of money at the boxoffice they know that the imagination can tell you everything you need to know about a situation the only things we get with blair witch are our characters running and screaming for their life and subtle noises in the woods we never see the witch she may not even exist but we only know as much as our characters which gives us plenty of reason to be scared for them suspenseful and eerie the blair witch project continues to creep me the hell out and the ending is still nerverattling
Jul 15 2012,negative,failed to be scary  it seemed so fake to me that it didnt catch my interest
Jul 13 2012,negative,it was good till i  noticed they didnt show the witch the deception
Jul 9 2012,positive,the citizen kane of our generation if you dont believe then think about how many movies tried to copy it afterwards it also helped give birth to the reality tv movement as well this movie still gives me chills because like the great horror movies of the past it left it to your imagination to fill in the blanks while most movies drop the ball by revealing too much   gore does not equate to horror what your imagination can come up with is far worse
Jul 8 2012,negative,90 minutes of my life that i will never get back
Jul 7 2012,negative,overated and at times boring but still not terrible
Jul 7 2012,positive,a terrifyingly original movie
Jul 6 2012,positive,like it or not agree or disagree this is one of the most original movies ever made it change the way movies are marketed forever if you say you new it was a hoax the whole time youre lying if you say you werent creeped out even a little youre lying
Jul 5 2012,positive,perfect dark and raw mockumentaryunleashing a terror that mounts maybe not all audiences will like it but i love it for the originalityno slasher gore blood or violence only a creeping thrill that overwhelm
Jun 28 2012,positive,just 25000 the woods 3 actors and a camera pretty darn awesome id say
Jun 27 2012,positive,a chilling movie with a creepy ending the documentarytype setup was innovative and the atmosphere matching
Jun 27 2012,negative,shittest film ive ever seen
Jun 27 2012,positive,strange more people enjoyed the incredibly fake cloverfield than this clever homemovie style thriller
Jun 22 2012,positive,at the time this was the scariest shit
Jun 22 2012,negative,suckfest not scary
Jun 21 2012,positive,i love this movie it makes me feel so sad for these ppl tht hve done this its a mystery that wont rest
Jun 21 2012,positive,although its rewatch value is rather limited blair witch is nonetheless a masterpiece of immersive horror the apparant lack of a monster creates a nightmarish scenario in which everything surrounding you the use of handheld footage places the observer right in the action takes on a nightmarish somewhat gothic malevolence the supernatural horror of the intangible unknown has never been captured so perfectly as it has been here
Jun 20 2012,negative,what made me watch it ill never know
Jun 19 2012,negative,this one sucked but i like the blair witch 2
Jun 18 2012,positive,creepy and subtle this film is a horror classic than cannot be topped this is sleepwiththelightson territory
Jun 18 2012,negative,it probably would have been good but the camera angles took away from it and annoyed the hell out of me
Jun 17 2012,negative,not for those prone to motion sickness
Jun 17 2012,negative,swearing and foreshadowing nothing else poor
Jun 17 2012,negative,the blair witch project is the start of the infamously trashy found footage genre with the exception of a few gems here and there and isnt scary tense or remotely likable thanks to its awful characters
Jun 17 2012,positive,the first handheld camera film to combine mainstream promotion with indie filmmaking the concept is original and inventive but the issue is in the conclusion we never had a conclusion because of the poor sequel much better then expected but dont feel its worth repeat viewings the handheld camera puts that part to rest
Jun 15 2012,positive,if it hadnt been so hyped this would have been a lot of fun  i still like the ambiance it creates and overall creepiness without actually showing anything
Jun 14 2012,negative,the movie isnt scary and its pretty dumb nothing out of the ordinary is seen  just little noises more interesting then the fourth kind though another movie that claims to be a true story but is fake  because i actually managed to watch this movie all the way through  note i previously gave this a 2 and a half stars but now i am alot more stricter on how i rate movies this is a definite 1 and a half star movie
Jun 14 2012,negative,boring awful lost interest after 12 minutes
Jun 13 2012,positive,it looks totally real and even possible but it relies a little too much on your own simple fears and less on the story and is actually pretty boring for a while however the ending really sticks with you
Jun 12 2012,neutral,this movie is one of the most disappointing movies ive ever seen i dont know how people think its scary
Jun 12 2012,positive,even though this film uses a personal film camera the film has really good resolution which gives the scary scenes really terriffing there is alot of low lighting basically most of the film was filmed at night time the setting of the movie gives it a very creepy and unwelcoming feel
Jun 11 2012,negative,stupid stupid really classic vb movie very bad
Jun 11 2012,positive,this movie is soooo weird and freaky
Jun 10 2012,negative,stupid they should have made it look more believable
Jun 10 2012,neutral,finally i saw blair witch many weeks eleven to be precise after its release in the netherlands  to be blunt about it i didnt really like it i appreciate the fact that it shot on a really small budget but that does really show  there is really not much of a story nothing much really happens until the end and even then we actually dont see anything  admittedly the woods at night might be scary but blair witch keeps repeating the same type of scene flashlights pointing into the dark woods without ever seeing a single thing after an hour or so this started to bore me and to think that this is not a very long film its all hardly enough to keep you hanging on for 90 minutes  on the brighter side this is a very cleverly made film with an even cleverer marketing campaign which took place mainly on the internet the acting by the three newcomers is actually pretty good it all looks very natural  the blair witch is eery at times but i definitely didnt think this was the most scary picture in history  not by far still it has acquired somewhat of a cultstatus so you might want to check it out anyway
Jun 10 2012,negative,although it may have launched the found footage genre blair witch project is boring and seems like the filmmakers put almost no effort into writing or filming low budget shouldnt mean that the film actually feels like watching a dull home video
Jun 9 2012,positive,one of my all time favorite horror movies
Jun 6 2012,positive,boring at some parts but very very creepy at others
Jun 5 2012,negative,it seems as though the directors have mistaken anxiety for suspense this movie wasnt very scary not at all the whole time watching this i just wanted it to be over with also the arguments in it were long and tireding
Jun 4 2012,negative,this movie sucked balls it was just a shaky camera plus 120 f words what a piece of garbage
Jun 3 2012,positive,it chills you and thrills you watching the blair witch project because it seems real the whole documentary style of it makes you scared when they end up getting in some sort of danger jerking the camera around may make viewers sort of sick but its super effective
Jun 3 2012,neutral,i first came across this movie in my drama class and our final exam we had to do a skit from a movie i started looking and i came across the scriptpart where a girl was recording herself saying how scared she was she was also crying my teacher wasnt going to let me do it because he said it was too scary and that it was one of the freakiest movies ever done i ended up doing it and got an a on the seen and had to cry and everything i finally watched it i never knew it was real footage and it is based on a true story it seemed boring at first then it starts to get more lets just say interesting
Jun 2 2012,positive,the first time i saw this i thought it was real when it was finished i couldnt move coz i was so fucking scared this is so creepy i like the concept coz it makes the film feel realistic we havent seen anything like this ive never heard of the blair witch the problem i had was probably the pacing and the drama with the characters but when it was night wow scared the shit out of me the atmosphere they build up with the sounds and voices is done so very well the scene where they hear children laughing outside their tent scared the fucking shit out of me this is a delight to see and youll have a good ol time if you love this creepy stuff
May 31 2012,positive,one of the greatest horror fims ever
May 30 2012,negative,the characters are boring but it is sure to give you the chills
May 28 2012,positive,though the slow pacing may deter some the blair witch project is an atmospheric terrifying movie that triumphs over most slasher flicks due to the fact that it is ambiguous about many things letting the audience imagine whatever terrifies them the most the ending is excellent providing me with one of the scariest scenes i have ever seen though i dont plan on rewatching it anytime soon the blair witch project is definitely a worthwhile experience to anyone that can handle slow pacing and a lot of shaky cam in return for memorable scares    rating 7510

May 23 2012,positive,this movie made me sick lol just because of the camera movement i loved this one though good story and it was believable
May 21 2012,positive,it was actually really frightening
May 21 2012,negative,the only reason this movie is in the horror genre is because of how horrible it is damn near three hours of mindnumbing boredom i literally fell asleep for about 40 mins during the film and guess what when i woke up i wasnt lost  know why there was no story to follow after spending money to see this i wanted to kick my own ass
May 20 2012,positive,i was one of the people who thought prior to the movie being released that it was in fact real until my sister ruined that for meyet it still to this day scares the heck out of me even my teenagers are terrified when they watch it and they prefer it without sound can you imagine watching it 5 times with no sound everi wonder if it would be even scarier with sound

May 19 2012,positive,i really loved the emotion in this movie it made it feel authentic i hear the cast adlibbed everything if so bravo
May 18 2012,positive,i could never suspend my disbelief here and the whole thing was kind of silly but it had a nice plot it was entertaining there were some nice hooks and twists it was better than many of the later films that were made within the foundfootage genre if you want to learn about this genre you really need to start with this film
May 18 2012,negative,give me something jump scares atmosphere anything just give me something that makes me give a crap about the movie
May 18 2012,neutral,i give it props for starting the whole found footage craze but blair witch simply does not live up to the hype plenty of great setup but no good scares to pay it off
May 17 2012,neutral,this film delivers so much on titular suspense that everything else seems to fall short
May 16 2012,positive,not bad for a 60k budget
May 16 2012,neutral,shaky cameras and a lack of any action beyond frightened teens cursing the blair witch project provides only scares of the lowest quality

May 11 2012,negative,the biggest scam ever  what a rip
May 9 2012,positive,takes a while to get moving the found footage genre almost always makes me nauseouscloverfield but aside from that this film is a wild scary ride with one of the most disturbing conclusions i have ever seen in a horror film
May 9 2012,positive,undeniably haunting with people acting naturally rather than like crazy people just to progress the plot like paranormal activity no this is found footage film at its best
May 8 2012,positive,when i first saw this i must admit i was scared to death so it must of been alrite
May 8 2012,neutral,overhyped pile of crap starts out interesting and then spirals into complete mediocrity the end gives the hint of something scary but there is so much bad acting going on that i can see why they tried to push this off as real
May 7 2012,positive,a low budget film with an unseen threat and a noname cast that provides a scarier better acted and more engaging experience than most horror films
May 5 2012,negative,lets walk around in the woods with a camera oh waitthe blair witch project already did that darn
May 3 2012,positive,terrifying movie but not so scary that i couldnt enjoy it

May 2 2012,positive,this film shows the power of darkness and faint noises can be extremely terrifying an important film in horror movie history
May 2 2012,negative,this is a movie which unfortunately spawned a lot of copycat found footage movies none of which have been enjoyable  its bad  theres nothing more i can say about it beyond that  the acting is atrocious the story line could be good if it was handled differently the way it goes together is atrocious and all together its just a bad bad bad movie

Apr 29 2012,positive,needs to be watched in the dark to work
Apr 28 2012,neutral,it certainly brought the chills but the project didnt bother to spend a cent on something visually intimidating leaving it only to our imaginations how boring
Apr 28 2012,positive,three lost kids running around in the woods screaming sounds absurd but the movie sucks you in so that you feel for them that youd be doing the same thing if you were in their shoes  lots of language though nothing you havent heard before but just a warning if youre up for an intense adrenaline rush give it a shot
Apr 28 2012,negative,the best part was the credits the rest is like watching grass grow
Apr 27 2012,negative,i remember the hype that surrounded this film when it first came out  i also remember this movie being horrible to watch but i dont know if it was due to the movies substance or the fact that i had my wisdom teeth out the day before
Apr 27 2012,negative,i dont see the witchonly symptoms lol anyways time pass but creepy one

Apr 24 2012,positive,when it first ame out i saw it and was a little creeped out cause i though tit was true after finding out it wasnt and watching it a second time it was kinda funny
Apr 22 2012,positive,the first movie to prove that you dont need a hugeass budget to create an effective film cult classic now but box office buster then moody and creative blair witch delivers some great mythology and puts a unique twist on the thriller genre
Apr 22 2012,positive,a classic horror and its good the first time around but upon a second viewing it didnt impress as much

Apr 9 2012,positive,scary and believable
Apr 9 2012,positive,very nice could be pepped up with a cameo from anne ramsay
Apr 9 2012,positive,blair witch project is a clever horror movie that created the birth of found footage films and prooves that imagination is scarier than blood and gore
Apr 9 2012,negative,it was ok the book was horrible tho
Apr 8 2012,negative,complete waste of a couple of hours of my life that i wish i could have back
Apr 7 2012,positive,i know this isnt a popular opinion but i really liked this movie
Apr 7 2012,positive,ridiculously scary yet entertaining
Apr 6 2012,positive,scared the crap out of me
Apr 6 2012,positive,has its moments of what are they trying to do here but it draws u in and you have to watch to see the ending to see what happened worth renting and watching with the lights off bad portrail of withcraft as most movies do
Apr 6 2012,positive,surprised this scared the   out of me
Apr 5 2012,positive,made me sick and it wasnt scary enough
Apr 5 2012,positive,good movie not as scary as i expected woulda been cooler if it were true p
Apr 5 2012,negative,this was the worst piece of shit ever created i would rather watch paint dry than watch this thing ever again i literally liked the sequal more than this but it was shitty as well  but i will admit the acting is surprisingly very well but this thing could have been so much better it was disappoiting on almost all levels

Apr 1 2012,positive,scared me when i was younger
Apr 1 2012,positive,it was ok but looked totally fake
Apr 1 2012,negative,horror scary  i dont think you would scream if i showed up at your place and just ran around cursing for no reasonscreaming that something is after me when in fact nothing is

Mar 24 2012,positive,l0lz this movie scared the poo out of me
Mar 22 2012,positive,frighteningly convincing
Mar 22 2012,positive,different  which always stands out in films
Mar 21 2012,negative,can be enjoyed the first time you watch it
Mar 19 2012,positive,its so interesting creepy and cool i love that feeling un uncertaince when you see the movie for the fiirst time its great
Mar 18 2012,positive,the original foundfootage film any naysayers that complain about the lack of scares obviously miss the point of the film you are supposed to empathize with these kids and their situation the lack of any physical threat only adds to the creepiness of the story the final shot is among the most frightening in the history of cinema
Mar 17 2012,positive,things that seem real like a murderous old lady living in the woods are a lot scarier than the most other horror concepts that are unbelievable everything about the blair witch project seems plausible the way its filmed the reactions  dialogue of the performers their fear seemed very real  it convinced me to be scared with them
Mar 14 2012,positive,groundbreaking horror in its time and gave people in movie theatres motion sickness lol classic
Mar 12 2012,positive,you either love it or hate it but i love this shaky cam pioneering horror that created a genre and told a thrillingly realistic story the ending creeps me out to this very day
Mar 12 2012,negative,boy did this scare me when i was 12 no joke
Mar 10 2012,positive,despite being a very interesting experiment this is still a rather repetitive and soso horror film which never really comes alive until the final moment
Mar 8 2012,positive,its outstandingly crafted ending is worth the insufferable pace far more important is blair witchs demonstrating that today any amateur filmmaker with a vision can have a means of realizing it with the potential of success
Mar 8 2012,neutral,yeah its creepy as hell and atmospheric and yes i know people do under stress act this stupid but that doesnt excuse some of the pure unintentional comedy from the constant bickering between the student and the near absurd amount of profanity i mean i understand some movies feature heavy profanity and are ok for it but this profanity god was so uneeded by the characters that it became so bad that every other world was fk
Mar 7 2012,positive,best found footage film yes yes it is
Mar 4 2012,positive,the original and best
Mar 2 2012,positive,the fact that you didnt see the blair witch made it scarya hell of a great horror film
Mar 2 2012,negative,i rooted for the witch
Mar 2 2012,positive,i watched it in daylight and it still scared me i was afraid to go downstairs and get something to drink after watching this i dont understand why people hate it so bad its not bad once you now whats going on like the ending you have to listen to what they say at the begining about how she likes to put one in the corner and make the person watch as she kills the other you just have to pay attention to what they are saying now people who get motion sickness easy would not want to watch because the camera is constantly moving so the screen is quite shaky at times so they made a web site up and said it was realbig deal they just want to make you scared and think it is but truly it is not one thing i found annoying was the f word being used in every other word i think that could have been avoided the think i like the most is the fact that they make it seem so real likje its actually hapening thats the great part and the things the witch does to scare them like making it seen like there are children outside plaing then the tent starts shaking this is a very good horror film you have that feeling once they step into the woods they are doomed and the witch is gonna catch up to them in the movie heather says about the story of the blair witch that it is creepy but phenominon thats what i got to say about this movie it will creep and scare you big time
Feb 27 2012,positive,im so glad that its been revealed that its a made story i was so fing scared when it was advertised as true story
Feb 27 2012,positive,spooky the ending was fucking awesome
Feb 25 2012,positive,a short movie that has a scary and disturbing last 15 minutes before that a large build up of tension and a feeling of claustraphobia not as scary as paranormal activity but it is how the type of films started almost a classic
Feb 25 2012,positive,a well made film excellent acting with believable dialogue it felt like a legitimate documentary which is obviously what they were trying to achieve only criticism is that the only real scare was the 10 minutes towards the end other than that great mysterythriller
Feb 24 2012,positive,it was quite convincing it seemed quite real you dont really see anything but because it seems so real its really scarry
Feb 22 2012,positive,i thought the advertising and plot of this movie were brilliant
Feb 20 2012,positive,perhaps the scariest movie ive ever seen
Feb 18 2012,positive,the only thing that ruins it for me is the dependence on profanity to fill in where dialogue it supposed to be
Feb 17 2012,negative,yeah i guess there were some scary parts to this movie  the last five minutes were pretty good  but as horror movies go this really sucked  as long as you stay in the movie itll make your heart race and your pulse pound and your head hurt and your stomach puke  and thats the problem  its really easy to get out of this movie and once youre out its not scary at all  all it takes is a simple distraction like the bobbing of a camera to break the magic of being in this movie  a horror movie should not be that weak  however for as poor as the movie is the background story and marketing will make you want to see it  and make you think that youve missed something if you havent  so youll want to see it just dont have your expectations set too high
Feb 15 2012,positive,loved this because i once lived there lol
Feb 13 2012,negative,damn this movie for spawning an endless pule of found footage shaky can shitters
Feb 12 2012,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen first the filmmakers give themselves away with some of the dialogue which definitely killed the suspense for me they further give themselves away with talks of cal ripken jr and it took everything in my power to even stay in the theater this would have been cute if the film was made by 10 year old kids not college students as advertised i think the critics purposely gave this film high acclaims because they wanted to be different all blair witch project proved is that any fools with video cameras can get lucky and hit the lottery however people like me suffered from motion sickness and general sickness from just seeing this film dont bother wasting your time i am still waiting for my refund
Feb 12 2012,positive,only for people with an imagination  otherwise junk
Feb 12 2012,positive,this movie was scary dont listen to what anyone says turn the lights off in your room and watch this alone because this movie stimulates your imagination youll feel as though you are in the woods with the cast and will constantly have to remind yourself that this didnt happen
Feb 9 2012,negative,now i know why i waited 13 years to see this film
Feb 9 2012,positive,proves that thrills and scares dont have to be fast paced and inyourface imagination reigns supreme
Feb 8 2012,positive,revolutionary film with found footage and viral marketing very good
Feb 8 2012,negative,pretty anticlimactic and lame
Feb 5 2012,positive,about as terrifying as a movie can be the sense of isolation hopelessness and fear is profound
Feb 5 2012,positive,about as terrifying as a movie can be the sense of isolation hopelessness and fear is profound
Feb 4 2012,neutral,for some reason the 2nd was very spookey to me when i watched it at a young age  they werent protraying it as a true story but as a horror film
Feb 4 2012,positive,independent film that made a fortune of three disappeared students recording a documentary on a local witch legend promoted as a true documentary when released really was the first film of its kind now its impact seems diminished as years have passed
Feb 2 2012,positive,hmm not scaryand not realpitty tho still good
Feb 2 2012,negative,the movie which started it all  three film students create a documentary and disappear and someone finds the film  people think the film is real even after the actors from the film are interviewed  the movie is interesting because of the concept   regrettably the movie is on too low of a budget with choppy acting and a disappointing  ending  if you see the ending you will yell i dont get it  stupid  the film has been copied many times over and done better  i give the blair witch project a 2 out of 5 avoid this film  i found it disappointing
Feb 2 2012,positive,decent gem in the horror genre
Feb 1 2012,positive,this is horror done right the blair witch project keeps you scared without having to resort to blood and guts
Feb 1 2012,positive,the blair witch project is an essential film for the horror genre and its impact has stood the test of time as still being one of the scariest films ive ever seen this film was massively successful upon release bringing the found footage genre to the mainstream as well as convincing a large portion of the audience that the footage was real and that these three filmmakers had actually died the film is about a documentary crew who venture into the black hills forest to debunk the myth of the local blair witch and as we know with any horror film involving teens in the woods it doesnt go well for them this film is special for many reasons mainly the realistic approach to the camerawork and of course the three central actors joshua leonard michael c williams and heather donahue who bring an unparalleled sense of realism to their performances the actors were given general outlines of where to go but almost everything they encountered was random to them so much of their reactions are real which is just brilliant filmmaking without question the scariest part of this movie is the ending and still every time i revisit it as soon as they enter that house im holding my breath until the iconic final shot its definitely not as flashy as most modern horror films today but its subtle approach and iconic scares still really work to this day as long as you have the patience for it the blair witch project changed movies forever and holds an indelible mark in the annals of horror cinema that will likely never be topped and i cant recommend it enough for true horror fans
Jan 31 2012,positive,ill get it out of the way right nowas a mocumentary this film was terrible well compared to the newer paranormal  activity and such but kudos to bringing about a new horror genre   on the positive tip if u ever cut your own trails camp off the beaten path or generally explore the land this movie will scare the crap out if you for me it us this situational fear that hits home as an outdoors man that travels on the land with no maps or gps i can definitely relate to the fear of unexpected noises odd land formations springing out of no where and the mind tricks that poor weather and little sleep can play on u its the idea of putting myself in there shoes that creates the fear
Jan 29 2012,negative,this movie sucked so much that i gave it half a star not interested even paranorml activity wasnt this bad    gradef
Jan 28 2012,negative,didnt find it nice
Jan 28 2012,positive,original i have to give it that
Jan 27 2012,negative,it gets a star for the genuienly creepy ending
Jan 27 2012,positive,definately a milestone in the pseudodocumentalhorror genere this film is pure genius and suspense just like paranormal activity
Jan 25 2012,positive,a true innovation in film making and the horror genre still unique and gripping
Jan 24 2012,positive,strays from the cliche of popup scares and instead plays on the viewers senses and imagination to instill bonechilling fear
Jan 24 2012,positive,one of the most terrifying atmospheric movies i have ever seen
Jan 23 2012,positive,scared the crap out of me the first time i saw it
Jan 23 2012,positive,one of my all time favourite films who would have thought this movie was a fake is it someone tell me for my own peace of mind
Jan 23 2012,positive,after watching this then bonus film on the whole blair witch thing its got me puzzled
Jan 22 2012,positive,ending couldve been better but ending aside this is the best found footage film ive ever seen
Jan 21 2012,negative,i was expecting more tension and horror yet i was left with just a group of lost college students complaining about a map
Jan 21 2012,positive,the blair witch project manages to deliver its chills and thrills by making audiences imagine whats beyond the cameras reach and not showing its main antagonist
Jan 21 2012,positive,omg this movie freaked me out you actually think that this is a real document and u just get lost in the movie that you just get scared the people that made this movie got sooo much money for it and all i got to say to that is bravo
Jan 20 2012,negative,overrated horror movie
Jan 20 2012,positive,its really really scary unexpected scares will leave u shaking
Jan 20 2012,positive,creative and scary for its time
Jan 18 2012,positive,greatbest friend and i love it
Jan 17 2012,negative,this film is so boring and nothing happens in this movie
Jan 17 2012,positive,creepy and pretty cool even though the ending is a little too ambiguous for its own good
Jan 17 2012,positive,in 1999 the blair witch project took audiences by storm with its generic technical aspects and documentary style filmmaking  this movies impact began to give rise to a genre of horror movies known as the found footage genre  while having the impact it does audiences remain split about this movie altogether        the plot revolves around three college film students that travel to the woods on the outskirts of burkittsville maryland in hopes of making a documentary about the legendary blair witch that haunts the place  the movie starts off with a series of interviews of the residents conducted by the students as they set off for the woods  while there they stumble across a series of unusual findings  they encounter what looks like a burial ground strange stick figures hanging from trees that dont look like they were crafted by human hands and their belongings covered in slime  as they remain in the woods things start to take a turn for the worst  their food supply begins to run low they lose their map and they start to get terrorized by strange noises in the night         the entire film is told through the two camcorders that are used by heather and josh  this movie contains no special effects and the forces that terrorize the three characters are never shown on screen  what results form this movie is a very effective and immersive horror movie that effectively uses its technical aspects just as effectively as any high budget horror movie         technically the found footage genre can trace its roots back to the controversial 1980 italian cultfilm cannibal holocaust  i havent seen that movie myself but i have heard from viewers that parts of its plot are blair witch like in terms of style  the difference is that cannibal holocaust has a concrete story of characters that find footage of a documentary and the plot goes into a style such as this one while the characters play it           this movies plot is told is told entirely through found footage and the plot revolves around the viewers finding it  that very fact alone provides a great sense of immersion and mystery  due to the forces never really being shown it always begs the question as to how much of this is real or if the characters are crazy  this is one of those movies where the horror comes not from what one sees but from what one doesnt see  the greatest part of this movie is the scene is where heather make her amends through the recording to the viewers and effectively conveys her mental state realistically         this movie would later go on to inspire such movies like cloverfield paranormal activity rec and the last exorcism  i have seen paranormal activity but not the rest of the films mentioned  it was also celebratedparodied by cartoon network as the scooby doo project  which was a series of reallife animated segments featuring the gang of sleuths telling their latest mystery in the style of this movie  the dynamics of this movie are used very effectively and provide some decent thrills  it goes to prove that what one doesnt see can be just as if not more effective than what they do    thanks for reading and happy halloween
Jan 16 2012,negative,this was such a pile of crap  i saw it at the 150 theater and overpaid  and i was treated
Jan 16 2012,positive,a generationally defining documentary paving way for future films the last exorcist paranormal activity and other mockumentaries
Jan 16 2012,positive,one of my favorite freaky flicks of all time the ending gives me chills just thinking about it
Jan 16 2012,positive,this way of making film is quite interesting and fresh
Jan 13 2012,positive,if you like realistic feeling movies youre in for a treat  the shakycamera effect almost makes you feel like youre experiencing whats happening  scary as hell and will leave you dumbfounded at the end thinking what just happened
Jan 12 2012,positive,the only reason this film isnt 5 star is the shortchanging and empty ending when the low budget becomes really evident otherwise this is a film that plays on childhood fears and reminds us why we were scared of the dark
Jan 11 2012,positive,good performances make this film feel believable and the scares and mysteries set up are good ones if you prefer subtle psychological scares
Jan 11 2012,positive,one of my favorite films of all time and one of the best horror movies in the last twenty years the blair witch project is a truly original piece that spawned an entire generation of likeminded knockoffs and wannabes revisiting this film proved a fruitful endeavor for as a child i could not fully appreciate it or even look at the screen long enough to see what was happening because i was too afraid to know i would cover my ears and look away from the screen until i was sure the big scare had passed most of the time though there was no massive jumping scare  there was constant mood catching atmosphere that left me feeling frightened dead and in danger to this day watching the blair witch feels incredibly real relevant and disturbing part documentary part horror film and part clandestine meditation on urban legend and the horrific reality of what we dismiss as story i still feel like this movie was real even after the actors have played in and directed other films the blair witch project will always be real to me it is under my skin even as i am typing now im looking over my shoulder i am afraid of the woods  of the dark  of the witch
Jan 10 2012,neutral,the first hour is atrocious the last 25 min almost make up for it
Jan 10 2012,positive,ill never ever watch it again but this movie was very smart
Jan 9 2012,negative,it is based on your opinion if a film like this is real it depends on what happens what they are there to do and why the blair witch project is not the first film that is based on this genre because there are movies back from the 80s that declared their film has real footage uncut the blair witch does tend to be effective but fails to scare sure the ending of the film is kind of weird and spooky but sometimes it just feels like a camping trip with your best friends three teenagers are lost in the woods as they are filming a documentry it seems the curse of the blair witch has hit them and they cannot get out you dont see the enemy the enemy is them by them the enemy could be inside of them maybe the enemy is the woods who knows its clever but the film suffers from the lack of scares instead they show us details that will try to get something down your spine but i couldnt find it scary enough the blair witch project is not real and is not a bad movie but it lacks scares to all who watch it    57100 c
Jan 8 2012,negative,what a bag of balls do not waste your time
Jan 3 2012,neutral,it just wasnt scary it has some chilling moments but they dont feel all that genuine
Jan 1 2012,positive,great when i thought was real
Jan 1 2012,positive,i dont know what it is about this movie but its on my topten creepiest movies list
Dec 30 2011,positive,probably the best horror movie ive seen does a lot with very little
Dec 30 2011,negative,it really wasnt very good i was massively disappointed in how boring it was to watch i can see the parallels people draw between this and paranormal activity unfortunately neither movie is enjoyable or frightening
Dec 29 2011,positive,although nothing much really happens in this film theres a lot left to the imagination and that and the very seemingly realistic reactions from the cast makes the blair witch project a surprisingly creepy and unsettling movie especially towards the end
Dec 28 2011,positive,the movie that set the standards for horror movies like paranormal activity
Dec 28 2011,negative,why this film is considered one of the scariest of our time i dont know
Dec 27 2011,positive,i liked it kept you wondering what was going to happen next
Dec 27 2011,positive,amazing scarier than hell
Dec 27 2011,neutral,the hype was big the budget was small if you want to watch a movie that was made on a handycam go right ahead ill pass next time
Dec 26 2011,negative,of all the found footage films out there this is by far the weakest
Dec 25 2011,positive,in 1994 three student filmmakers went into the woods of burkittsville to film a documentary on the blair witch they were never seen again one year later their footage was found that is basically how the blair witch project begins this film was released during the summer of 1999 during a time when slasher sequels had risen again and were tearing up the teenage audiences both metaphorically and literally in the movie sense when first glancing at the blair witch project you may be turned off by how it was made the entire movie is shot like a documentary and before i go on anymore we know now that the movie was just that a movie there were no student filmmakers making a documentary on anything and thats what made this movie scary as hell as rolling stone put it in their review of the movie     we follow these filmmakers heather mike and josh as they venture to burkittsville maryland formerly known as blair as they try to understand the legend of the blair witch in the beginning they interview townspeople and about 15 minutes into the movie they make their final and apparently fatal venture into the woods while there they uncover more of the legend but as it moves along we soon discover that the three filmmakers are lost and have no map to get back what follows is some of the scariest filmmaking ive ever seen in my life looking back at it now it seems funny because there have been so many parodies of this movie most notably in the wayans brothers movie scary movie which came out only one year after this film did you never actually see anything that may not sound very scary but believe me it is i cant remember the last movie that actually was able to scare an audience by showing nothing and just leaving it up to the imagination movies used to do this all the time but that time has come and gone so see a movie like this it literally scares you     now there are people out there that call this movie stupid and boring and i can see where they are coming from this is not by any means a movie to watch over and over again but it is indeed a movie that you need to see at least once granted this movie is not original by any means in fact in bears a strong resemblance to cannibal holocaust from 1980 the main difference between the two are that in this movie you see nothing in cannibal holocaust its the exact opposite you see everything in cannibal holocaust only the last half of the movie is the footage the filmmakers made with lots of cutting between present time and the footage itself in the blair witch project the entire movie is the footage     the marketing for this movie was some of the most ingenious marketing ive ever seen basically posters had the above mentioned tag of the film about the footage being found the filmmakers even went as far as putting out missing photos of the three people and launching a website with all these facts on what happened to the three filmmakers on the internet movie database the three actors were listed as missing this was a very big marketing technique so well done that people actually started to believe it which is probably why the movie did so well    the blair witch project became the highest grossing independent horror movie since halloween some twenty odd years before the movie cost only 60000 to make and made over 140 million domestically and over 245 million worldwide this went onto spawn numerous mockumentaries and even a terrible sequel book of shadows blair witch 2 the following year i think the coolest of these offshoots was that of the mockumentary on the dvd of the blair witch project titled curse of the blair witch which gave out all the facts of the blair witch a very interesting little piece nothing has come along since this movie to live up to its fear and ingenious marketing
Dec 25 2011,positive,very good except the camera movements hurt my eyes
Dec 24 2011,negative,they lost a mapooooo scary
Dec 23 2011,positive,a master class on how to do suspense on the cheap  it really is that scary
Dec 21 2011,positive,ahead of its time new concept to audiences back in 1999 but looking back the film lasted a bit too long i do congratulate the filmmakers who decided on this concept and made bank wish i can come up with a fresh look to a film on the cheap perfect timing on their part for releasing this film around halloween
Dec 15 2011,positive,yes it scared the shit out of me wanna fight about it
Dec 14 2011,positive,this is a boring movie but very scary in some parts ill never forget the bloody internal organ wrapped up in paper that they found in the woods
Dec 13 2011,positive,the citizen kane of found footage horror movies this one invented the genre in 1999  a lowbudget amateur production thrown together by a handful of people with a few days of footage cobbled together into a tidy 84 minutes  and it simply works  the acting is largely believable and the pace is perfect  from the opening minutes the interviews with locals feel quite real the enthusiasm of the 3 filmmakers soon turns to frustration then fear then panic then hysteria  and over what  this is the best horror movie ever made where the monster is entirely left to our imagination
Dec 13 2011,positive,another perfect example of the mainstream not knowing a good horror film from a hole in the ground not only did this movie give us a refreshing moment in modern horror which was pitifully bad in the years leading up to this film but it revolutionized hollywood film making     plenty of hitchcock in this movie as you never see anything whatsoever its all in the viewers imagination and that is just as scary as anything you can put on film a great example that movies can be just as effective if not more so with a tiny budget and no name actors     people are so quick to put down this movie for some reason but praise pos horror movies like drag me to hell and any of the horrible saw films this is a horror movie for intelligent movie goers who appreciate not being bludgeoned to death with every scene this is an art school style movie that is genuinely terrifying everything works to its advantage its pacing its actors and its all around feel
Dec 12 2011,positive,too much hype curse of blair witch   9scifi channel special better
Dec 11 2011,negative,retarded but kinda scary cause your not sure whats going on
Dec 11 2011,negative,waste of time massive waste of time
Dec 10 2011,negative,the tiny plot meanders forlornly resorting to spook touches that were old before the brothers grimm were born
Dec 9 2011,positive,first of its kind love the aftermath that left after the movie
Dec 8 2011,negative,avoid it or youll be sorry
Dec 5 2011,positive,the father of found footage movies despite not actually seeing much throughout the film it still manages to create a very creepy atmosphere and even some scares proof you dont need to see the monsterghost for a film to be scary
Dec 4 2011,positive,scared the crap out of me when i was 9
Dec 4 2011,negative,had hard time watching with the shakiness
Dec 4 2011,positive,i would probably only watch this once because you would know what to expect the second time and it wouldnt be as fun as the first
Dec 2 2011,positive,the blair witch project works so well because of it feels so much more real than other horror films  it makes us feel the loss of hope and the knowledge that their fate is all but certain  i must say no matter what you say about the ending it was one of the most chilling and intense moments i have felt in a horror movie in a long time  this is what makes a great found footage film and will leave you scarred
Nov 30 2011,neutral,in my opinion it was nowhere near as effective as paranormal activity or cloverfield it might have been one of the found footage pioneers but the payoff was rather weak and the college kids were unlikeable
Nov 29 2011,positive,47 percent user rating seriously this is a huge cinematic achievement a horror movie that was only rated r for language not violence not nudity but language this is a very good movie it features some shockingly realistic acting from practically unknown actors it created the found footage subgenre and plus it was really scary     i mean theres not many movies that can scare me the way the blair witch project did i was still as stone for those last twenty minutes what a terrifying finale its so good to see a horror movie that is more about actual horror and less about gore and shock value     for all of you who gave it negative review you probably went in thinking it was gonna be bad and sat there the entire time tearing it down not giving it a chance i suggest you watch it again
Nov 29 2011,positive,this is a great movie to watch while camping
Nov 29 2011,positive,honestly this is a really creepy movie you must allow yourself to put aside your pride dont think and watch it in order to enjoy it yes it might be made up yes it is scripted but it will always be one of my favorite horror movies as well as a classic
Nov 28 2011,positive,it could have been a great film if it werent for heather donahue  she overdoes it so much that i couldnt really enjoy the film  other than that its not bad
Nov 27 2011,positive,scare yourselves witless  good watch once  yeah
Nov 26 2011,negative,hated it shaky camera overload
Nov 25 2011,positive,terrifies me each time i see it
Nov 21 2011,positive,after a fifth viewing im still not completely sure whether or not the blair witch project is a great horror movie  there are friends of mine who hate it and friends of mine who love it and in the past three days i have been jumping from one side of the fence to the other what i can be sure of and what i can assure you reader is that on at least three of the five viewings it engrossed me like few films are capable of engrossing me i felt real fear for these three sometimes annoying characters the story is a good one the set up is the best and the ending though flimsy at times is one for the record books the blair witch project is not a film for everyone those who cannot afford the patience this film requires of its pacing and characters must look somewhere else for a good creepy flick for those in the mood who are willing to get lost in those dark woods this is the film for you
Nov 21 2011,negative,it gets a whole star for the last 45 seconds
Nov 21 2011,positive,this movie was scary but some of it was boring because it was a documentry thing  i do believe on this movie but the 2nd was just a croc of shit
Nov 18 2011,positive,scary  terrifyingly real and filmed with only a handheld camera    blair witch project proves to be a satisfying horror film  without all the stupid antics most horror films have its fun  suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your seat to the very last second a
Nov 18 2011,positive,this movie doesnt shows its ghost in face it doesnt even utilizes nature as a ghost which movies like final destination do the way protagonists in this movie gets succumbed and lost in the forest makes us feel the presence of the ghost of this movie which is the biggest achievement for a horror movie many years before only alfred hitchcock was successful in using this technique in his movie rebbecca
Nov 16 2011,positive,if you can immerse yourself in the situation the campers find themselves in this is scary as hell
Nov 11 2011,negative,why did i ever see this movie honney convinced me we were interested in what it was all about  im kinda interested how they made a two must investigate that later maybe josh was still alive  hahaa
Nov 11 2011,positive,scary ass shit  well it was when i was 9 lol
Nov 10 2011,negative,i finally sat down to watch this after years of avoiding it  if you have never seen it dont bother  ill tell you what to expect 90 minuets of shaky forest footageliterally  for a college film its quite ingenious as a piece of entertainment its frustratingly pointless
Nov 6 2011,positive,this movie will freeze your blood even when the ghosts doesnt appears
Nov 5 2011,positive,its got its detractors and its supporters you love it or you hate it i happen to love it its a stripped down horror flick built upon atmosphere and a true sense of being lost i still believe that what you dont see is far scarier than what you do see this film aces that as far as im concerned the first time i saw it still one of the most unsettling cinematic experiences ive ever had
Nov 5 2011,negative,the blair witch project  such a boring movie not scary and has a crap ending
Nov 4 2011,negative,possibly the worst horror film ive seen 3 out of 10 and watch it  all the way through low budget or not it  this is a bad film
Oct 30 2011,positive,excellent ground breaking movie
Oct 30 2011,positive,disappointing i know the movie came about over 10 years ago but still i dont undestand how the movie got so much attentionhype and filmmakersmarketing started making those real footage films  which way it just harm the movies like paranormal activity etc my own opinion    but back to movie    the blair witch project got some moments and the ending was good and was only scene where you think oh now horror get started but of course the director writers left something to peoples own imagination how story could continue etc some levels acting was cheesy but other hand the cast made better job than some alist actors in big budget films    the blair witch project is still a good example how make average film with a low budget and this opened a doors with amateur filmmakers who wants some day making own movies
Oct 30 2011,positive,in defence of the rating i saw this when it first came out opening night everyone thought it was true thanks to a brilliant pr campaign and it was also getting rave reviews and i see it at an impressionable age with my older and tougher friend and we leave the sold out show afraid to walk back to the car that is an impact and still with repeated viewings late at night when it is stormy it is freaky nonetheless it wasnt the first cannibal holocaust beat this movie and the tedious paranormal activity to the gimmick so no more blaming of the creepy as what christians call hell the blair witch project
Oct 29 2011,positive,not scary i laughed the entire thing
Oct 29 2011,positive,i own it and i might do not want to own it disappointing movie end was a bit exciting but nothing more it didnt make you feel like creepy more like oh when the fck is going to be some horror makes you restless
Oct 29 2011,positive,i give this a perfect score for sheer balls  i dont think its a coincidence that i never heard any bad reviews for this film that wasnt from someone firmly footed in the safe certainty of its fiction  if you saw the film after its first week of wide release that may be understandable  the filmmakers were forced to reveal their brilliant hoax to avoid mass hysteria much like orson welles war of the worlds  but imagine if you will starting in early 1998 at least two cuts of the film started showing up on vhs dubs among collectors  in this day of google infancy there werent many tools for debunking such things  the version i saw was shorter missing the official ending cutting off with the iconic snotty close up  so if you can imagine what you would think watching this film with no information to comfort you into believing that it wasnt in fact video recordings from actual naive film students getting lost in the woods and perhaps harassed by someone intending to do them harm  in the fierce debates among those who saw it in this fashion even the disbelievers had to admit it was a brilliantly enacted hoax  by the time the film hit sundance in 99 word had leaked out that they were actually students from florida and there was no substantial evidence for a blair witch lore it was probably based on the bell witch of kentucky  even then i kept my mouth shut and watched the film opening weekend in a packed theater  the fear was palpable no jumps screams giggles  just mesmerized frightened silence  when the film ended no one moved no one knew what to do  ive never seen as many open mouths in one room in my life  as i left the chatter was consistent what happened to them  it was later that week that the cast got trotted out on leno to tell everyone were fine  the cat was out of the bag and most people who had the luxury of watching the film after that well assured of the fiction were already claiming not to understand what the big deal was all about  for a brief moment for a small number of people blair witch was the most frightening thing on the planet  i dont believe there was a blair witch sequel  dont bother telling me otherwise  it has been carefully extracted from my consciousness with very expensive chemicals  it never happened and youre just wrong
Oct 29 2011,positive,if you want to see a horror film that gives you nightmareswatch the blair witch project  delivers not only scares and chills but a well planned plot of the film
Oct 28 2011,neutral,it must have been really scary with all the hype and viral publicity but now 12years later it lost all its momentum and novelty being just another mockumentary on the big pile we get every year still it has its moments and for the most part the tension still works fallowed more by laughs than screams
Oct 28 2011,negative,complete garbage what an utter waste of time pioneered an entire genre of crap cloverfield anyone
Oct 28 2011,negative,yes its frequently annoying and motion sicknessinducing but you have to admire it for what it is  they took absolutely nothing and made it kinda creepy creating the paradigm mockumentary in the process
Oct 26 2011,negative,its so slow that its hard for me to like it i wanted to like it but i just couldnt my problem being with the whole movie is that the entire time is either a man or a woman running around a forest with their faces right in front of the damn camera  even better you get to see their snot run down the camera sometimes too i guess the end is kind of shocking but the biggest downfall of the movie for me was that they made out all this movie to be real like some people actually got stuck in a forest  got taken away by some mysterious spirit but no its not real to find out that the makers of this movie are fucking you over is a huge letdown i would hate to see a die hard fan find that out blair witch project just turns out to be a really slow  annoying horror movie
Oct 26 2011,positive,the phenomenon that has become a cult scare in todays time remains fresh till date those who want real scares unlike cheap thrills will enjoy this movie
Oct 24 2011,positive,it was way too hyped up for me so i found it a little disapointing but overall it was kind of creepy
Oct 23 2011,positive,original  the best scary camcorder movie
Oct 23 2011,positive,the acting in this is absolutely chilling i wish we could see more of heather
Oct 23 2011,positive,i have to admit that towards the end of the film i was hiding behind my cushion peeping my eyes out just over the edges in pure fear
Oct 23 2011,negative,finally i had the opportunity to watch this film    i could have wait longer  i was very disappointed watching this having let all the hype impact my expectations  for the first 45 minutes of the film i was bored  the last 45 minutes i was just waiting to be scared waiting to jump  but nothing    if you havent seen this dont waste your time
Oct 22 2011,negative,this simply one of the most overrated movies of all time the only scary thing about this movie is how many people think its actually any good
Oct 22 2011,neutral,the final 20 minutes may be some of the most horrifying pieces of cinema ever screened however the excrutiating build up almost isnt worth it
Oct 21 2011,positive,maybe its just because i like foundfootage movies but i thought the blair witch project was awesome i thought this was better than most of the recent foundfootage horror films maybe since this is the one that started it all
Oct 20 2011,positive,overall this is what i think horror films should be it successfully scared me without showing me anything at all which is pretty amazing in my opinion it doesnt need high quality special effects for some scares and it didnt need a big budget this film is a must see if you like horror movies
Oct 20 2011,positive,clever creepy cool
Oct 20 2011,positive,scarymedium movie  but not great so i think
Oct 19 2011,positive,simple effective creepy and quite scary there were a few parts that sent chils up and down my back perfectly captures the terror of being lost in the woods add onto that some seriously creepy supernatural shit going down and you have a film that works surprisingly well its a plus that it moves at a pretty good clip and doesnt overstay its welcome i also have to give props to the sound design which is great and effective for a film that was only made on a budget of 60000 and that made a domestic gross of 140 million worldwide total was 248 mil im shocked at how well it holds up even 17 years later and at just how well made it was the performances are believable there are some bad lines though not many and the setting is a simple but terrifying the blair witch project may be the most successful film experiment i can think of and it still stands as the best found footage horror film ive seen they really should have stopped making found footage after this beauty its like a really good scary late night campfire storyone that i dont mind revisiting naturally its highly recommended there is also a good deal of shaky cam so if you get motion sick maybe you should sit this one outor just close your eyes when these parts happen and listen to the proceedings trust me youll be just as scared
Oct 19 2011,positive,quite possibly my favorite horror movie of all time it has the feel of  a real documentary found footage and the resulting feeling of pure seclusion in the woods only adds to the terror of the unknown antagonist the final scene dominates in pulse pounding suspense though sheer terror
Oct 19 2011,positive,a true horror masterpiece that leaves the details purely to the viewers imagination it really brings you back to the monster in the closet days
Oct 17 2011,positive,disturbing as it is blair witch leaves it all up to darkness to scare us instead of showing us disgusting creatures or possessed people
Oct 17 2011,positive,you know the story students go into the woods chasing a local legend dissapear then a year later their footage is found     a strange beast this in 1999 id say 5 stars now 3 see back in 19992000 the distrubter decided to market this movie as if it was real they kept us in the dark about whether it was actually found footage long enough that the uncertainty upped the creep factor considerable no film besides catfish has managed to capture that uncertainty well the last 15 minutes are effectivly creepy the rest of the film is undermained by the knowledge that it is just that a movie
Oct 16 2011,positive,despite one anyone says i still love the blair witch project just as much as i did when i saw it originally in the theater  no you may never see everything that you want to see but that is not the point of the found footage genre a genre that blair witch in many ways establishes  while there are previous examples like cannibal holocaust from the early 80s blair witch essentially gives birth to the modern found footage horror genre that has become so popular once again in recent years  a profoundly independent film blair witch utilizes the creepiness of special effects and simple deviations from everyday reality to craft an evergrowing sense of horror  for me its final momentsand many of those beforeremain absolutely chilling  it may seem cliche today to some audiences but blair witch established many of those cliches
Oct 16 2011,positive,the original hand camera movie horrifying language was annoying but otherwise the innocence of this idea this story and its so terrifyinggreat
Oct 14 2011,positive,this movie is amazing and alot more realistic than paranormal activity while i dont think its as scary or has as many jump scenes but i do think it has a creepier atmosphere throughout and a more shocking ending than any of the paranormal activity movies now in this day and age this movie might not appeal to everyone because it has no gore or nudity but fuck them its there loss but to smart movie goers i highly reccomend
Oct 12 2011,negative,didnt make it past 30 minutes it was bad i dont understand how it became such a hige success
Oct 11 2011,positive,if you use your imagination and suspend your disbelief this is a truly haunting and unsettling movie
Oct 9 2011,positive,genuinely quite a frightening film
Oct 8 2011,positive,ive never understood all the hullabaloo about blair witch  when it was big it was claimed to be one of the scariest horror films of all time and then when i saw it i was just underwhelmed  it has been over a decade since i saw the film that first time and ive given it another chance  i have to admiti still dont get it  yes there are some interesting suggestions of scary stuff but i never was truly weirded out or scared  first off i knew it was all just pretend made to seem completely realistic  the tent shakes and i know its just some guy jiggling it on the outside  secondly i kind of wanted that girl to just die  she was irritating  im not saying the film doesnt have some merit it sort of doesit really does feel like a student project but i just never believed any of the scares and i wasnt freaked at any time
Oct 7 2011,positive,it may start slow but the blair witch project promises staying in your head after hours of thrilling horror that will make your heart bump
Oct 7 2011,positive,scared the crap outta me
Oct 7 2011,positive,not the first found footage horror film but the blair witch project shot the style of filmmaking into the mainstream this film uses the creepy and dreary setting of the woods to strike at the viewers imagination whats great about blair witch is that you never see the villain of the film but the intensity is what really scares youyour mind starts to play tricks on you im surprised i waited so long to check this out its over 10 years old if youre a fan of really creepy horror you gotta give this one a watch
Oct 6 2011,negative,dont believe the hype  the only thing this film has going for it is its novel for the timedocumentarytype style  would get one star except that the last few minutes were a little creepy the first time i saw it
Oct 5 2011,positive,9410     the blair witch project is among the simplest most frightening and most visionary horror films ive ever seen its the kind of feature that some will no doubt find to be somewhat silly but its also one of those movies where i lose all ability to care about what others think in the end my opinion matters to me and my opinion is that this film is genius in how it presents itself and toys with various and common fears its scary in a sense that was groundbreaking for its time taking a texas chainsaw massacreesque approach to its subjects and diving headfirst into allout but surprisingly human and relatable terror its an exercise in pure horror with a keen eye for intense drama and even some mildly likable characters and engaging subplots its nothing more than a horror film and i openly accept that but when it comes down to horror and whether a genre film can horrify in ways that dont involve graphic rape or decapitation this ones kind of brilliant        no doubt ill surely remember it and for all the right reasons if it gives me nightmares  and its very doubtful that it will since no horror film has so far  then so be it this is the reason i like this genre to be scared to be terrified to relate to the horror thats all around us much of the blair witch project is filmed in a place where weve all been countless times and will be many times to come when we return well never forget the film and its everlasting impact whether you enjoyed it or not that will certainly be your first reaction to remember what you experienced when you watched it perhaps this will help you to appreciate it horror is at its finest when it comes through sheer realization in a world where most horror is either dumbeddown or far too sadistic to be truly engaging in terms of scarefactor this is a great genre picture that defied clich√©s and created a style that by now is to be considered a tad overused           the blair witch is a story lost in time a piece of adult fairytaleesque lore that exists only if you want it to the legend is seldom explored or chased but trios of film students is curious and decides to dig as deep as they possibly can into the mystery surrounding the story the threesome consists of heather mike and josh they start what is presumed to be a student film by interviewing local residents of burkittsville maryland where the legend originated they get some different reactions one man seems to think that the story itself is nothing more than a legend while another man tries to convince the students to turn back they dont      this begins the fascinating descent into hunting down the infamous tale of the blair witch a murderous figure who would kill off young children while the presumably next victim would stand in a corner looking away and awaiting their turn the students camp out in the woods in which these events took place and things seem to be going well at first theres little tension between the three their map tells them where theyre heading and where to get back and they dont suspect that this legend is anything to worry about however it starts with noises in the night twigs snapping the wind the students perceive these noises to be footsteps and they run run run things just get weirder from here on out so if you arent a fan of frights in the way of noises screaming and cliffhanger endings then this film may not be for you       oh darn me i mentioned the cliffhanger ending i shouldnt have done that well anyways i did so im guessing you want an explanation this is as much as i can provide you with the ending is as universally discussed and appreciated as it is despised its an ambitious ambiguous climax that completes the cycle of fear by giving no clear answers no easy getaways we must think for ourselves oh how frightening and since there are only a number of theories that we can truly pick from we must succumb to the fear and praise the blair witch project for all it is worth you may call it derivative which it isnt i call it one of the scariest movies ive seen and will ever see if only for the ending alone one which i will surely never shake from my memory oh joy          i hope the filmmakers responsible for this remarkably atmospheric film eventually make something else with their time they can make more quality products because with this here film they really succeeded in creeping us out with sound and thought rather than sight you dont see the horror there may not even be any horror whatsoever maybe the characters are merely going crazy we will never know and that in itself is quite frightening indeed in short this is simply lowbudget horror filmmaking done right an experience worth experiencing a film worth watching and its outstanding for what it wants and tries to be  and ultimately is if you cant seem to fathom the material and think intellectually about the skill and craft that went into making it as scary as it is then go stand in the corner     oh and despite any claims that say otherwise this film is not an unedited collection of the horrors that befell those three students the horrors never befell them in the first place the film and its material are entirely fictitious but as for the legend its all in the dark
Oct 5 2011,positive,pretty good but i think paranormal activity uses the mockumentary idea much better and makes it more entertaining
Oct 4 2011,positive,even through its countless imitators it retains a chilly raw effect by depending on our primal fear of the dark and unknown to supply the majority of the terror the camera stumbles and tracks through the woods and stares frantically into the dark and we feel carried along almost against our will
Oct 4 2011,positive,great ad campaign prior to its debut in theaters  still a creeptastic good time
Oct 3 2011,positive,all the very realistic camerawork and acting kept from noticing the credits written by   first time ive seen it could hardly sleep  some parts felt very real but were really funny  classic found footage horror
Oct 2 2011,positive,reputation precedes this work justifiably as the effect achieved is immersion into the dna of terror namely your own imagination  one might ask whats the worst that can happen but in truth you already know  you already know you already think you know
Oct 2 2011,positive,this movie was very scary and still scares me and that was last year
Oct 2 2011,positive,innovative and effective horror film
Oct 1 2011,positive,great acting by the female lead makes this film believable and scary
Sep 28 2011,positive,it should be seen because of the way it changed horror cinema not so much because of the scares it has left
Sep 27 2011,positive,another perfect example of the mainstream not knowing a good horror film from a hole in the ground not only did this movie give us a refreshing moment in modern horror which was pitifully bad in the years leading up to this film but it revolutionized hollywood film making    plenty of hitchcock in this movie as you never see anything whatsoever its all in the viewers imagination and that is just as scary as anything you can put on film a great example that movies can be just as effective if not more so with a tiny budget and no name actors    people are so quick to put down this movie for some reason but praise pos horror movies like drag me to hell and any of the horrible saw films this is a horror movie for intelligent movie goers who appreciate not being bludgeoned to death with every scene this is an art school style movie that is genuinely terrifying everything works to its advantage its pacing its actors and its all around feel
Sep 25 2011,positive,the ending was creepy if you understand it
Sep 23 2011,positive,original for 1999 and very eerie
Sep 19 2011,neutral,in my opinion it was nowhere near as effective as paranormal activity or cloverfield it might have been one of the found footage pioneers but the payoff was rather weak and the college kids were unlikeable
Sep 17 2011,positive,the only scary part of this movie is how much youll vomit after going through all that shaky cam thats not to say though that the entire movie sucks no the three main actors and actresses are fantastic their horrific human emotions are what primarily drive the movie but without it this film would have ended up a bland and boring mess if it wasnt enough of one already
Sep 17 2011,negative,this is an insultingly overabundance of shakycam and filled with useless dialogue and unlikeable uninteresting characters  it just gets so headacheinducing after a while that you just want to look away from the screen and get an aspirin  and its not even until the last 5 min where it actually gets scary and then it just stopslame  the direction they were going for was cool like many other foundfootage films but it really fails here and not worth another viewing  im sorry but this movie is a complete waste and way overhyped
Sep 15 2011,positive,people had a lot of mixed opinions about this but it was pretty scary
Sep 15 2011,positive,one of the scariest found footage from a personal video camera type movie355
Sep 14 2011,positive,i found it horror than paranormal activity the scene of woods with always fear of witch next attack left us in total dried mouth i simply love the idea used in the movies like blair witch paranormal activity and cloverfield it makes movie with lot of suspense and thriller with desperation to know more i found blair witch though very incomplete i know it just shows us the videos of the students but it still left me with lot of questions even i wonder whether there even witch around there or it is the work of some humans nothing is concrete only speculation i like the movie with complete end or atleast allow us to make some concrete assumption but here we are left with tada the psychological thrillers are awesome i beg for more such movies though they are very limited
Sep 13 2011,positive,succeeds in scaring and proves you dont have to add special effects to truly terrify people
Sep 12 2011,negative,a complete waste of time with no horror or suspense  the characters are annoying and unenjoyable and the ending is a giant middle finger to the audience
Sep 9 2011,positive,it might not be loaded with screams but when the credits roll youll still be digesting the engrossing dreadfilled events its not a ride its an experience
Sep 5 2011,positive,91 really scary and it√¢s more scary when you know the rumors that it was a truly fact
Sep 5 2011,positive,not very scary more creepy than anything even though it was a little drug on its still one of the best movies ive seen    overall  b
Sep 4 2011,positive,drop the senselessly gory saw series pick up something that doesnt have to make see the horror to scare you
Sep 4 2011,positive,the blair witch project is a good low budget film with some believable acting and the chilling scenes with the unknown ive heard about how this is one of the best horrors of all time and to me it wasnt really frightening till the end which was absolutely insane and very memorable give credit though for inspiration for more found footage films
Sep 4 2011,neutral,its different yes but it wasnt any good or at least to me it wasnt i know being lost in the woods is scary and this could have been a truly terrifying movie but it wasnt to me nothing scared me true the last 15 minutes or so was creepy but not truly scary the girl ruined the movie for me she was so dam annoying why couldnt she have been the one to disappear instead of the guy the whole time i kept wishing she would get it or something would happen to her i was patient with this movie and it wasnt worth it i guess if you like psychological horror movies then this will probably be scary i just did not find it scary and i couldnt even use my imagination because the whole time i kept imagining that the dumb bitch would just die and that this movie would be over i must say that i do give the actors credit id probably would have acted like them if i were in the situation and this movie did start the mockdoc genre so ill give credit where credit is due but since i wasnt scared at all and i found the girl to be extremely annoying 24 stars
Sep 4 2011,positive,this movie was scary as hell well i have been reading the myths of the blair witch and its really interesting i liked it a lot it had a creepy atmosphere showed amazing acting its about a group of college students that go in the woods and start disappearing this was a really creepy movie she first scares you then snatches you in the middle of the night thats all im going to say    grade   a
Sep 4 2011,positive,clever smart but not scary at all
Sep 3 2011,positive,still one of the most revolutionary films of its time the blair witch project opened the door for every shaky camera film that we enjoy today ie cloverfield paranormal activity though most of the film is just three people arguing in the woods the sound design and sheer creep factor plays well on screen creating a truly unique horror film
Sep 2 2011,negative,theyre in the woods the camera keeps on moving i think theyre looking for some witch or something i dont know i wasnt listening nothings happening nothings happening something about a map nothings happening its over
Sep 2 2011,negative,the movie that ruined horror movies forever thanks
Sep 2 2011,negative,if you are looking to be scared for a film dont look to this one in fact for the first ninety percent of the movie it felt like more of a comedy although most likely unintentional the excessive use of select four letter words is reminiscent of the cheesier parts of the hangover i lost count after they said the f word 40 times and the dark scenes with eerie noises get a little bet redundant after about the twelfth time trust me i generally scream like a little girl during horror movies but i had no problem falling asleep after this film
Sep 1 2011,positive,still one of the best horror mockumentaries of all time never gets old
Aug 31 2011,positive,suspenseful realistic scary a real classic and a real feat of indie cinema
Aug 29 2011,negative,not as great as everyone makes it out to be i watched it alone in the evening and i wasnt scared at any time this coming from someone who can freak themselves out quite easily for the production year it could have been much better than it was while still considering that it was low budget overall i really dont understand all the hype that this film gets
Aug 28 2011,negative,worst film i have ever seen in a movie theatre the only movie i left 15 minutes into and the only one i requested money back on
Aug 27 2011,positive,it might be fake but that was a hell of a scary movie
Aug 26 2011,negative,a movie for americans
Aug 22 2011,positive,one of my favorite horror films of all time  its amazing what a couple of kids can do when they put their mind to it  for having no acting experience they can act better than 99 of hollywood  excellent
Aug 21 2011,positive,i know its cool to hate this movie but outside the brain dead morons who believed it to be real footage this actually had a pretty great horror movie atmosphere its hard to find anything creepier
Aug 21 2011,positive,people seem to forget how innovative this film is sure not much actually happensno goreno visible monsters but just the realistic  fear and tension in the characters alone makes u sweat bullets and thats sayin something
Aug 17 2011,positive,i love this movie i think that this is a good horror flick and i also think without this movie there would be no cloverfield or paranormal activity this is a classic
Aug 16 2011,negative,the last scene was the only scary part of the movie the rest of it was just the three students yelling at each other
Aug 14 2011,positive,47 percent user rating seriously this is a huge cinematic achievement a horror movie that was only rated r for language not violence not nudity but language this is a very good movie it features some shockingly realistic acting from practically unknown actors it created the found footage subgenre and plus it was really scary     i mean theres not many movies that can scare me the way the blair witch project did i was still as stone for those last twenty minutes what a terrifying finale its so good to see a horror movie that is more about actual horror and less about gore and shock value     for all of you who gave it negative review you probably went in thinking it was gonna be bad and sat there the entire time tearing it down not giving it a chance i suggest you watch it again
Aug 11 2011,positive,totally groundbreaking when this came out though there has been films like this before eg cannibal holocaust is the first one that springs to mind blair witch project is not exactly the most to me scariest movie out there but it is sure weird and the process of how this film came to be is almost as fun as the film itself shot in a you are there docu style we see three fiilmmakers go into the woods to debunk a scarybeing in the woods story and of course they get lost and of course weird things start to happen silly kids this is all quite fun and was a pleasure to see again
Aug 11 2011,negative,the single greatest movie about three douchebags walking through a forest while nothing happens ever made seriously you will be shocked at how nonshocking this movie is see blair witch you will believe your eyes    spoiler alert no spoilers because nothing happens the whole time
Aug 10 2011,positive,i was one of those who caught this early and it scared the living shit out of me
Aug 9 2011,positive,very good not as scary as it was made out to be but still frightening
Aug 9 2011,positive,although it might seem sluggish to some the whole thing is fascinating and incredibly realistic the concept is simple but powerful and the movie shifts from fun joyride to riveting drama to shocking horror its surprising that nobody in this movie got nominated for an oscar considering how realistic they were in extremely demanding roles in the end the movies not full out scary but its creepy and gut wrenching and really makes you feel for the three students i had trouble sleeping afterward even though i was long way away from any woods
Aug 5 2011,positive,the only film to ever give me trouble when im trying to sleep  original inventive and unbelievably frightening
Aug 3 2011,negative,so bad that i literally laughed at every scene
Aug 2 2011,negative,it felt real at times but i was disappointed
Aug 1 2011,positive,the blair witch project was and still is one of my favourite films of all time the movie builds suspense on the very realistic premise  being lost in the woods things get more and more tense in the group and horrifying events lead to an insanely great ending not a typically scary horror flick but an incredibly effective one on those with wild imaginations
Aug 1 2011,positive,4 and a half stars simply for its uniqueness breakthrough movie with new scares and filming techniques good movie when i was 10 and good movie to this day props
Jul 31 2011,neutral,itsokay    the movie start out cool student filmmakers that disappeared in the woods and a year later their footage was found and this is what we are seeing  however the way this movie is shot is irritating  every scene is a pointofview shot from a shaky camera  yes i know this technique is supposed to mimic a low budget documentary and give the audience a feeling of being there but it makes the movie chaotic and ruins the enjoyment of watching  anyone with motion sickness needs to get some dramamine before watching this  there are jarring transitions points where the camera is turned off and on  a lot happens at night and without light all we have is audio of panicked voices and some weird sounds    so we have some goofy college kids that are getting ready to go off into the woods to do a documentary about the blair witch  they are making faces to the camera and acting like they have room temperature iqs  in other wordsthey are the typical dumb students to be killed off in a horror movie     they end up getting lost in the woods and blame each other for it  some weird things happen rocks gets stacked in their campsite stick figures hang from the trees and their tent gets shaken at night  that would would be scary on a camping trip  this is the part of the movie that works very well  there are no monsters guys in ski masks guys in hockey masks or guys with chainsaws  this is psychological horror  these simple objects rocks and sticks come off as more unsettling than any bigbudget special effects because the imaginations of the film students have been enhanced by the legend of what they are investigating this part of the film comes off as scary and this is the part worth seeing    however there is more than enough dumb to overwhelm the good  the dumbest scene and theres a lot of competition for this is the one in which one student laughs like a moron as he explains how he threw the map away probably becasue he was too dumb to read it  heather comes off as  the typical liberal bimbo that talks about nature but doesnt know anything about it  she claims that it is impossible to get lost in the woods because we have destroyed all our natural resources in america and there arent enough woods to get lost in  apparently she never bothered to look at usgs topo map of where they were going to be and has never heard of national forests    even though most of this movie is dumb and boring the good parts are those that remind us that the things we cant see are the scariest  this is a testament to the things that go bump in the night  watch it for those scenes
Jul 30 2011,positive,it was great while people thought that it could be real footage  and then not so much but it was groundbreaking in its marketing
Jul 29 2011,positive,a bit slow of a movie but then it finally brings the so told horrors at the very end which makes you think of the horrors people had on witchcraft when our founding fathers came to america
Jul 29 2011,positive,visit unlockawesomeweeblycom and landofawesomeweeblycom for reviews  great scary horror movie   gradegradea
Jul 29 2011,positive,an almost perfect horror film one of the most effective horror films ever made great acting by unknowns excellent editing and the fact that 90 of the dialogue was improvised makes it even more impressive
Jul 29 2011,positive,i think it has been just about 10 years since i last saw this film and it is just as good as the first time i saw it the documentary effect works like magic you can genuinely believe you are watching something happen that you shouldnt be what is also interesting about this film is that you dont really see or hear a single frightening happen yet you can still be scared as another critic said you could hear every detail about this story and when you watch it it will still freeze your blood an a effort and result
Jul 28 2011,positive,its okworth seeingeven if it isnt real at allits there to see for fun so go check it out
Jul 28 2011,positive,so i finally watched the blair witch project and didnt think that it was nearly as scary as i thought it would be but still thought it was really well done with the right amount of eerie chills and proper atmospheric tension to be ultimately very effective and unnerving
Jul 25 2011,negative,not scary at all and extremely boring but i give it some credit for being very realistic the ending is somewhat creepy but its really not worth the wait its like an hour of kids just walking through the woods i like found footage movies like this marble hornets could be the scariest thing ive ever seen but i just dont really like this one
Jul 25 2011,negative,tried to watch 3 times but its so bad i couldnt keep wake
Jul 22 2011,negative,seriously overrated
Jul 21 2011,positive,the blair witch project is a typical group stranded movie but has true fear and fright within its found footage and screams
Jul 17 2011,positive,grade a             blair witch project is about a group of film students that make a documentary on a urban legend called the blair witch this movie is believable and utterly terrifying making your imagination the true horror of this film
Jul 16 2011,positive,genuinely creepy and explores loneliness and degradation of morality under strenuous circumstances the performances all seem very genuine too
Jul 16 2011,positive,kinda creepy but meh
Jul 15 2011,positive,unconventional approach making this one of the scariest movie of all time
Jul 14 2011,neutral,its kind of a shame i didnt watch this at night because i might have gotten scared then unfortunately at day time and maybe even night it isnt all that scary it had moments of weird stuff but nothing id call horror or terror although if i ever get lost in a forest nightmares from this movie will come to me just like paranormal activity its just boring until the end 10 minutes of creepy stuff thats all
Jul 14 2011,positive,its a good movie but if youve got a nervous stomach  be careful
Jul 13 2011,positive,only one criticism  not quite sure that  normal person would have been so obsessed with continuing to film under such circumstances
Jul 13 2011,positive,one of the best horror films ever
Jul 13 2011,positive,the good criterion of horror movies are not always using highbudget sfx just like this movie youll need your friend beside when you was watching it
Jul 12 2011,negative,this movie makes me sick like im on an airplane with super bad turbulence and its not scary at all and the acting sux
Jul 12 2011,negative,the camera work actually made me feel seasick and the hype before this movie really let me down and ruined the experience for me
Jul 9 2011,neutral,most people would probably argue with me on this one but this movie creeped me out
Jul 8 2011,positive,the acting and camera work is alarmingly convincing creates a genuine nervy atmosphere simple but effective
Jul 8 2011,positive,standout direction and performances from the lead castthe ending will stay in ur mind for a long time
Jul 8 2011,neutral,alright ill be honest with this one the whole film was really interesting in general but in the end when they didnt show the witch it was a huge cocktease i mean come on if the film was called the blair witch project why aint they show me the witch i was hyped and ready to be scared that i might see a witch at some point in a quick flash like that or she maybe just drifting slowly and scarily or something like that but what i get nothing but tonnes of stupidly shaky cameras sorry movie but if you want to scare us you need to show us the real fricking haunting thing to scare us in it finally i will give this a 5910 due to the fan basis but if i was to be nicer a 610 would be my score but i feel like a dick giving quite a high score so ill stick with 5910
Jul 8 2011,negative,such a waste of time do not watch this i was so bored during this movie and to be honest i really couldnt complete watching the blair witch project   i think andrew sarris reviewed this movie to a tee by saying where is the suspense where is the involvement where is the identification
Jul 7 2011,negative,nothing happens until the last few minutes watching people hike for an hour is boring it does get creepy though
Jul 7 2011,negative,i thought it was crap tbh too many continuity errors for what it is this was supposed to be based in 1994 and yet there was a kid holding a tamagotchi and in the shop there was an oatmeal bar that also wasnt out yet the storyline is that they go missing and the footage on their cameras show what happened had to watch it twice was so bored that i fell asleep almost halfway through     i give it 14 of a star out of 5 lol
Jul 5 2011,neutral,mediocre effort produces mediocre results theres nothing terrible about it but nothing good either
Jul 5 2011,positive,scared the bejesus out of me when i was 14 havent seen it since but im sure the thrill would be gone at this stage still a pioneering style in horror it was
Jul 4 2011,negative,boring and in no way scary
Jul 2 2011,positive,the chilling and griping tale of students lost in the woods of burketsville maryland while shooting a documentary opened the door for marketing online and low budget film making
Jul 1 2011,positive,despite the camera handling throughout the film i found it a thrilling and creepy film which ill be watching anytime in the night
Jul 1 2011,positive,thats right im defending the blair witch project fuck all yall
Jul 1 2011,positive,sometimes a little boring but the movie is really scary
Jun 28 2011,negative,if it wasnt for this movie i wouldnt have endured the pain of watching paranormal activity  ive always hated this film and now i hate it more  boring waste of time and money  i cant believe i ditched school in 99 to watch this rubbish
Jun 23 2011,negative,scary but the storyline is badly written quite boring and overrated
Jun 23 2011,positive,another classic supposedly put it togheter from an amateur video about a blairs witch documentary thats the key of the film really scary if you think of it that way
Jun 22 2011,positive,a very tense horror but not as good as they say we need stuff to happen for it to be scarier then it actually is leaves you guessing what is haunting them and whats next but nothing ever really happens still scary though
Jun 21 2011,positive,great storytelling
Jun 21 2011,positive,summer of 99 ill never forget a perfect storm of things that raised the hair on my neck and shot electricity down my spine imagination required
Jun 19 2011,negative,lolwut take seventyseven taxing minutes for a climax that doesnt come close to delivering what youd hope and credits and theres the blair witch project i wouldnt suggest bothering unless you hope to lack enjoyment from your movie viewing
Jun 19 2011,positive,very little chills but i thought the movie was pretty boring
Jun 19 2011,positive,a slow burner thats worth hanging in there for even if it will piss allot of people off
Jun 19 2011,positive,definitely the start of something new
Jun 18 2011,negative,highly overrated boring and not scary at all 15
Jun 18 2011,negative,just spent my 1 hour 27 minutes of my life for this shit
Jun 16 2011,positive,the whole movie is incredibly creepy but it never felt too frightening until the end the entire sequence at the house is perfect
Jun 14 2011,negative,i dont understand why so many people found this movie scary i did not sure at some points i thought whats going on here but not so many times that it was scarylike interesting idea though that so many thought it was real when it was first released
Jun 9 2011,neutral,descent horror movie not really that scary at allbesides the last 10 seconds which left me kind of creeped out
Jun 4 2011,positive,if you want to watch a movie so scary you crap your pantsthis isnt it however its a great independent film with a great ending youll see where paranormal activity got it from
Jun 4 2011,positive,when a movie dosent have little gore little vilonce and unseen antagonist its deemed unscary but the pyschological factor of the blair witch project brings it all together with untrustable crew in a not so dense forest in a small town and twist it rightfully great way it is one of the greatest and more ambitious horror film i ever seen
Jun 4 2011,negative,the blair witch project is horrifyingbut not in the scary movie sort of way rather this film is terrifying because of its ridiculously lackluster plot onedimensional characters awful script and completely inept cinematography which induces both nausea and boredom i would rather watch a soundless twohour montage of drying paint
Jun 4 2011,positive,le projet blair witch
Jun 3 2011,negative,an interesting but all ready boring concept that has been done before this film came out
Jun 2 2011,positive,important but does not hold up after all these years
Jun 1 2011,positive,totally dependent on ingenious engaging and emotionally charged atmospheric tension brillian handheld camera techniques in a documentary style that puts the viewer right in the mix of things and the image of these events as if they actually happened this is a horror flick that pulls off its scares in a far more effective way than most ever have and very few have ever achieved  whats more frightening than a described as harry beast like witch that can control your mind  one that you only hear and discover what it leaves behind for you but never actually see
May 28 2011,neutral,really good movie i love how it is set up as a documentry  and how it was found footage and how it expaned who was the blair wich and the end creeped me out it is one of the best found footage movie ever and how they have the interviews
May 25 2011,positive,is still the scariest hand held camera themed movie
May 25 2011,negative,this was the worst piece of shit ever created i would rather watch paint dry than watch this thing ever again i literally liked the sequal more than this but it was shitty as well  but i will admit the acting is surprisingly very well but this thing could have been so much better it was disappoiting on almost all levels
May 25 2011,negative,by far one of the most stupid endings ive ever seen  this movie never even showed you the witch
May 22 2011,positive,this movie is an original and at this point in time its a classic  love it or hate it you have to watch it at least once
May 21 2011,positive,this movie is based on an interesting concept  a student documentary about horror that becomes horror itself  it is far better and less stereotyped than it sounds as the actors are natural and everything feels authentic  the minimal budget and unknown actors help a lot in creating this atmosphere  however the suspense is uneven some parts are a bit long and lead nowhere  in general the movie is somewhat disappointing and frustrating to watch but it is original
May 21 2011,neutral,not the best mockumentary film
May 16 2011,positive,slowmoving and visceral this 80minute teethgrinder benefits from a character driven plot and unique sense of realism which gives it a refreshing legitimacy among your other average runofthemill supernatural horror flicks
May 16 2011,positive,very scary  a nightmare  my two greatest phobias are basiphobia fear of falling and mazeophobia fear of getting lost    the campers in this realityfilm are trying to document a local legend called the blair witch    in doing so they enter the forest and appear to be taken into an alternate world or something    they cant find their way back home to safety and each camper starts disappearing onebyone    blair witch is freaking scary totally    as a boy scout i used to go on orienteering hikes and the threat of being lost was on my mind        you could say this is a ripoff of cannibal holocaust but its hard to say whether the kids who made blair witch would know about cannibal holocaust      there were a lot of phony assertions that blair witch was a real legend i even started to believe it were true like the jersey devil 200 miles east of here ithaca new york    altogether blair witch project is very creepy and haunting and scary
May 15 2011,negative,should be sued for making a movie this horrible one of the worst ive ever seen ever
May 15 2011,negative,i get terrified of scary movies but this didnt even give me the chills not impressed
May 15 2011,positive,what this film does and what happens so rarely within hollywood is to take a simple idea not overblow it with special effects or wellknown actors and play to the deepest darkest fears within the audience woods sounds in the dead of night something that cant be seen but is all around a film that even to this day influences filmmakers throughout the world  the blair witch project made the conventions of modern psychological horror  and that is not an overstatement
May 14 2011,negative,1 12 star 1 star more than i initially wanted to give this for the nice idea and concept the half star is for  no suspense  no atmosphere  no real developement  it didnt scare me and i didnt watch too many horror movies so normally it doesnt take much of a movie to scare me i watched it with two girls who are almost afraid of their own shadows and they were bored too
May 13 2011,positive,definately a milestone in the pseudodocumentalhorror genere this film is pure genius and suspense just like paranormal activity
May 11 2011,neutral,nothings happening nothings happening its over a lot of people look pissed
May 11 2011,negative,it never gets really scary and the ending is pretty tame its more about people arguing than witches
May 10 2011,positive,the blair witch project demonstrates an ageold horror movie truth that which is left to the imagination can be as frightening as anything onscreen
May 8 2011,positive,it may not be a true story like the film suggests but the scares here work because you see nothing there is no bigbudget special effects and its all about feeling and atmosphere which makes it all feel so realistic and equally as terrifying
May 6 2011,positive,this movie is a the first pioneer in this kind of horror self shot footage  it opened the door wide for other movies like paranormal activity  cloverfield the chilling factor is always available which makes it one of the best horror movies youll ever see
May 4 2011,positive,the pinnacle of acting and psychological horror
May 4 2011,positive,this movie has done its job in scaring the living shit out of me i couldnt even watch the last five minutes of the movie i was that frightened
May 3 2011,positive,loved it  original narratives are what films should have  a great thrill ride though the forest with a fantastic endingalthough you have to listen careful to understand why it happens
May 3 2011,negative,overrated doesnt quite do this film justice how did it ever become a cult film there is no thrilling jumping moments and no horror scary moments other that the end it is about three people who go camping in the woods ill prepared
May 3 2011,positive,not as good as others of its kind paranormal activity but what makes it really scary is how real it seems
May 2 2011,positive,saw it in the theater when it first came out
May 2 2011,positive,not the worst thing ever but hey i have seen worse
May 2 2011,positive,this tale based on true events is not only terrifying but also very very disturbing most horror movies fail to make the audience scared let only genuinely disturbed the film avoids all clich√©s and ensures the audience are unaware of what is going to happen next without being necessarily gory or jumpy the blair witch project is original and a cinematic triumph    the set up of the characters and the film begins instantly without any unnecessary filler sequences the tone is creepy from the start as interviews with locals about the infamous ghost story of a blair witch create an uneasy atmosphere from that you find out all the background information that as the audience you need to knowyou are not left alone in the dark the tone goes from creepy to eerie as the three young filmmakers enter the woods the handheld camera is very effective and works perfectly to create an unsettling feeling for the duration of the film    the three leads are fantastic in conveying fear and distress in each of their performances all emotions on the human spectrum are tackled in this movie each of them equally played brilliantly the characters never do anything silly or ridiculous unlike most horror movies where theres always someone who has to go off on their own and be the hero there characters are real and that is all down to the acting and realistic dialogue     the chilling setting of being in remote cold woods with a lack of food and accesses to proper toiletries is a scary and horrible enough situation on its own the audience cannot help but feel to the characters torment and frustration in not knowing where they are and you mistakenly end up putting yourself in their situation the movies pace gradually gets more intense and gritty as the characters start turning on each other and their situation is not helped by mysterious objects being left outside their tent and peculiar noises in the notsofar distance    the blair witch project triumphs over most movies of the same genre as it manages to be spinechilling and haunting without the use of special effects not knowing what truly happens in deep in the dark woods makes the move ever so much more terrifying this will be hard to forget
May 1 2011,negative,the handheld cameras and convincing acting add to the realism but theres not much horror to be found herein instead theres lots of crying about lost maps some funny bits a long introduction about the myth and at best some elementary suspense clumsily thrown in
Apr 27 2011,positive,a good movie but juz a lil bit scary
Apr 24 2011,negative,please can i have the hour and 27 minutes of my life back unfortunately i was doing a presentation on it and had to endure this utter tripe of a film
Apr 21 2011,positive,one of the scariest movies ever grade a
Apr 20 2011,negative,boring and slow how in the world do so many people find noises in the forest so scary sorry but i almost fell asleep watching this
Apr 19 2011,negative,one of the most boring and least scary horror films that i have ever seen  i will never understand its appeal
Apr 17 2011,positive,full of creepy campfire scares mockdoc the blair witch project keeps audiences in the dark about its titular villain  thus proving that imagination can be as scary as anything onscreen
Apr 17 2011,positive,it could have toyed with the viewers emotions a little more but nonetheless a good film
Apr 15 2011,positive,this was well scary back in the day and the ending still gives me the creeps
Apr 13 2011,negative,crap i cant believe i actually paid to see this dull pointless piece of garbage
Apr 11 2011,positive,blair witch is one of the scariest creepiest most terrifying movie ever because of the lack of screen time of what were supposed to be afraid of  we never know excatly what it is but one thing is for sure our imagination becomes the scariest part of the movie which proves our imagination becomes scarier than anything they couldve put on screen  and that is why this film is so down right terrifying and petrifying
Apr 10 2011,positive,all about atmosphere and the fear of the unknown
Apr 9 2011,negative,overrated and gimmicky
Apr 8 2011,positive,im not big into the horror flicks but after seeing the trailer had to see this in the theaters  it scared the hell out of me not afraid to admit it  i also saw it when everyone thought it was real  the actors were in hiding so it made it that much worse scarier  if your a fan of horror flicks at all this is a must see  im with mr samurai probably the scariest film ive ever seen even above event horizon
Apr 8 2011,positive,how did people even think that paranormal was scary
Apr 7 2011,negative,pointlessutterly pointless
Apr 6 2011,positive,the first and one of the best style of horror in this way that is well over used now
Apr 3 2011,positive,love it or hate it the blair witch projected presented a different form of horror with a style that did not rely on excessive violence instead it relied on realism suspense and characterization the movie is well packaged and stylized well and has a good and original film to that will leave many horror fans pleased with plenty of others disappointed
Apr 3 2011,positive,what makes this movie so effective is its simplicity unlike most horror movies you never actually see the antagonist aka the blair witch which makes it much creepier as far as horror movies go it may not be as quality of a film as classics such as the exorcist or the shining but it is definitely much scarier in the way that the amateur footage brings a realism that had really never before been seen on screen this was definitely a breath of fresh air for horror fans as the genre has been riddled with senseless and overthetop violence this movie is definitive proof that less is more with horror movies
Apr 3 2011,positive,i watched it alone in a new house and had to sleep with the lights on brilliantly executed lowbudget terror
Mar 31 2011,negative,its about as incoherent as movies get there was no substance and nothing suspenseful scary or thrilling about it
Mar 28 2011,positive,a cult movie with simple means efficient in the storyline  cast a not so frightening movie but impressive by the way it captivate you with truefalse documentary  the ending  im still wondering
Mar 27 2011,negative,easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Mar 26 2011,positive,for a low budget horror film i still enjoy this even after all this time
Mar 24 2011,neutral,i couldnt wait to see this movie but was very disappointed when i saw it  yes the ending was scary  why oh why was that boy standing in the corner  i still dont like watching this movie on cable when it comes on  something about it scares me even though i thought this movie was kind of lame
Mar 24 2011,positive,i went in to bwp with high expectations due to an apparent shock horror ending but left with a sense of disappointment that doesnt mean the film isnt good at my age ive grown sick of the horror genre as it seems to heavily rely on jumps to get the audience scared what i liked about the blair witch project is that instead of jumps it was successful in building tension to the point where you felt always on edge never safe it actually spooked me a little the fact that all the actors actually made up a lot of the film on the spot shows how amazing this film was at the time nowadays not so much i would recommend this film but only if youre into the true horror genre
Mar 23 2011,positive,it was crap i thought it would be better than that it was an ok movie but i expected better it starred heather donahue i thought the film wasnt that good was expecting it to be a lot better i own it on dvd
Mar 23 2011,negative,i have seen some decent horror movies that dont involve blood or gore in fact i find suspense the scariest movie technique there is this movie is the exception an admirable job acting and it was okay for its budget but i do not see where its scary the overuse of cuss words like fuck and shit take away from the terror the characters must be feeling along with the highly annoying screaming that never seems to end and let us not forget the nauseating moving sensation the camcorder gives us it was okay but it could have been better
Mar 23 2011,positive,like so many pop culture phenomenons before and after it the blair witch project has suffered at the hands of a saturated market  the audience chewed it up and spit it out but i for one feel that it still stands the test of time as an effective and terrifying horror movie  even if the blair witch project didnt invent the use of shakycam as a means of eliciting horror in an audience the movie certainly perfected it  three unknown actors  who are indeed actors  you can catch heather donahue in a slew of madefortv movies now including stephen spielbergs miniseries taken  were sent into the woods with cameras pretended to get lost pretended to get scared and then pretended to get killed  the performances here dont have to be oscar worthy  what gives the blair witch project its power is in its ability to show the audience so incredibly little  it leaves a lot to the imagination playing off of the viewers fears instead of special effects or good performances  this movie is genuinely creepy scary as hell at times and i think its criminally underrated in this generation what with our passion for the shakycam
Mar 23 2011,positive,great movie i can imitate the booger scene pretty well
Mar 23 2011,neutral,ground breaking yet rubbish
Mar 23 2011,positive,god this movie was scary i mean like psychologically speaking without all the cliched horror elements you would expect in contemporary horror movies
Mar 22 2011,positive,it definitely got under my skin but the ending although smart in some sense was disappointing for me
Mar 22 2011,negative,i think the genre of this movie needs to be given a second thought
Mar 21 2011,negative,it is a little creepy but the acting so pathetic it can make it difficult to watch
Mar 21 2011,positive,fear of forest what myths become in an alien environment somewhere between imagination and the unexplainable
Mar 20 2011,negative,living on its viral marketing campaign this movie delivers the scariness and thrill of a movie showing grass growing and cost about the same budget
Mar 19 2011,positive,looking back over ten years after its initial release the blair witch project is an impressive yet flawed documentary style horror film filmed as found footage blair witch is a chilling film however there are many films of in this genre that are far superior to this film one example comes to mind cannibal holocaust cannibal holocaust was more raw intense and chilling than this many people have claimed that this film ripped off cannibal holocaust i can see similarities example the found footage angle but thats where it ends the blair witch project is not a perfect film but you have to admit that they were able to craft something like this with a 16 mm camera and turn out a profit and making it one of the most chilling scary found footage films ever as what everyone in the movie critics circle has been saying about this film i dont think its scary but i do believe its chilling the blair witch project is the type of film thats been sorta killed by the hype every mainstream critic that called it the scariest film since the exorcist doesnt know what theyre talking about i mentioned it was the scariest of it kind but i stress the fact that its what mainstream critics say of this film blair witch is chilling and tense but never feels truly scary there are far better films of this genre that are much more scary disturbing and twisted than this i enjoyed the film i thought it was a very creative effort but honestly i dont see why the film has gotten so much praise than it deserves is beyond me if you want the best found footage film hunt down a copy of the unrated uncut version cannibal holocaust but if youre new to the genre then give this one a look a good film but nothing phenomenal
Mar 17 2011,positive,one of the only movie to ever scare me
Mar 16 2011,positive,shit well that says it all huh      sure you might have already watched movies like this but hey that doesnt mean you cant get scared yeah you probably heard about the movie a lot and think its not worth your time you might want to think again though    the premise is about a couple of guys finding some video footage which was used by some people who got lost in the woods if that isnt appealing enough the woods are haunted by a witch called the blair witch look i know everyone knows whats going to happen but come on this is definitely one of the alltime scary films    besides the ending is fing intriguing and suspenseful although the whole movie got by without showing any glimpse of the ghost it managed to sustain the audience in a sort of whatthefishappening kind of way if you loved paranormal activity and the like youll root for more after watching this man      personally wouldve loved to see the witch in the end
Mar 15 2011,negative,i almost wish anyone who likesd this movie would die in a grease fire
Mar 14 2011,positive,this horror film really gave me chills down my waist its simply ending scene is one of most horrorscenes in film history loved the scene where ghostchildren are heard laughing and playing at night
Mar 14 2011,positive,im ashamed to admit i like this movie but it scared the  out of me
Mar 9 2011,positive,i have mixed feelings regarding this movie on one hand it was great as during that time such a movie wasnt common but on the other hand it was an average horror movie the footage scenes could have made for a better storyline but it was instead just mixed up i wished there were more definitive moments overall its just another movie that didnt live up to the hype
Mar 8 2011,neutral,the most groundbreaking and influential horror film this side of the 1980s blair witch project is a stylistic and experimental movie with great atmosphere a prime example of the fact that what you dont see is more frightening than what you do see all this said the film itself is not that good it drones at times certain parts feel unjustified and the film does not really merit a second viewing i commend this movie for its instrumental value not its selfvalue
Mar 7 2011,positive,people who say this movie sucks probably havent seen it yet sadly i was one of those people so i finally decided to watch it and i was completely surprised it totally creeped me out and scared me especially towards the end
Mar 7 2011,positive,i dont care what you think i love this movie
Mar 6 2011,positive,5 out of 5 stars the blair witch project is best viewed in the dark  i found this documentary style horror film quite effective as all three main characters were quite believable with their improvisations throughout the film the dynamics of heather josh and mike fed off of each other well and this helped to build on the tension of the plot  basically the blair witch project is a campfire story come to life but rather than including a lot of in your face blood and guts this story involves a lot of mind games and suspense while these three students appear eager to set out on their journey early on to investigate the blair witch legend they quickly are eager to leave the forest once things do not go quite as expected the apology scene with heather is a classic scene worthwhile for everyone to see
Mar 6 2011,positive,the crew treat it like it was really happening and thats why the movie works so well oh and the ending is scary as hell
Mar 5 2011,positive,one of my favorite horror films  it works on so many levels because unlike paranormal activity the handheld camera works and the actors are unknown so i could believe them better
Mar 5 2011,positive,three film students set out into the black hills forest to make a documentary on the legendary blair witch armed with a 16mm camera a hi8 video camera and a dat recorder every step word and sound is captured after wandering around the black hills forest heather josh and mike are cold lost and hunted finally one night after the last ray of light had left the forest black they were never to be seen again despite thousands of hours searching the black hills area neither of the filmmakers or any trace of their gear was found and the search was called off one year later a bag full of film cans dat tapes and video tapes were found the behind the scenes video footage and the film are cut together to make a fictional movie which seems more than real    this movie scared the hell out of me man one of the most extremely scariest and creepiest movie i have ever seen extremely real better than paranormal activity man very chilling very thrilling movie made me stick to the screen superb the ending of the movie was just awsome its a documentary style well the actors were good the night scenes scared me you never see anything but still makes you shake your boots lol i loved it
Mar 3 2011,positive,this movie have an interactive ways to deal with the audiences they let the audiences inside the movie by using first person view and let the audiences felt the grim reality of the project
Mar 3 2011,negative,too much hype and no content dont waste your life watching it fair play for the guys behind making a cheapass movie and making mega bucks from it glad to see hollywood embracing new film techniques since though but stop trying to recreate this nothing film
Mar 2 2011,positive,very real looking due to the first person camera what makes this movie so terrifying and different from most other horror movies is that the scariest part is that you never can entirely see what is happening just like you would if you were really in the situation i loved it
Feb 26 2011,positive,probably one of the creepiest movies ive ever seen in my life  awesome 
Feb 26 2011,positive,the blair witch project is very suspensful and very frightening it wasnt meant to be in theaters but still pretty creepy 
Feb 26 2011,positive,good but heather pisses me off lol
Feb 23 2011,positive,its the movie that brought back to life a style of filmmaking that hasnt been perfected sense the time of cannibal holocaust 1980 but unlike that one this one is more enjoyable to watch theres nothing sick or gross about this movie its perfect for playing with someones fear of isolation being lost without knowing any direction not knowing whats in the dark this movie also made handheld movies more acceptable for mainstream audiences this is a special movie one that should be talked about watched and thought about for years to come
Feb 21 2011,negative,happy halloween everybody now heres my review of blair witch          3 college students go to maryland in serch of the blair witch but when they go on the serch of it all sorts of obsticles are happening to them will they get out of there alive no          this is insanely overrated because all it is are 3 college students just complaining for 90 minutes i dont hate all found fotage movies paranormal activity and cloverfield were cool because there was more than 3 students yelling at each other and the ending why in most of these movies are there terrible endings but this ending was just stupid overall this was just a boring obnoxious and highly overrated 31 oh and have a happy halloween
Feb 20 2011,positive,this is a very interesting peice of film never before had i seen something like this movie before the more i watched the more i got sucked into watching it the strange occurances kept getting stranger and more frightening and thats what kept me glued to the screen
Feb 20 2011,positive,i totally bought into this gave me motion sickness and night terrors for 4 nights utterly brilliant
Feb 19 2011,neutral,it may seem like this genre is overexposed now but this was quite a clever idea 12 years ago the blair witch projects whole plot was building up to the grand scene every movie in this genre is but the build up of this film is slow and a tiresome process even though it was slow and tiresome the build up was worth the waiting for me but im not sure that other audiences have the same patience as i do and they shouldnt have to have the patience
Feb 19 2011,negative,clever idea it ends right there this film is like digesting a spew painfully sickening to watch  and hard to actually see whats going on with the jerky camerawork and dispicable lighting if you are going to make it seem real can you please make it visual enough to actually see whats going on scary hardly  its a great scam    although i did find paranormal activity very creepy this movie felt like a giant turd had landed on me i still want my money back
Feb 19 2011,positive,i actually thought it was really good
Feb 19 2011,negative,i remember the suspense of this one at the movie theater  now i find it positively goofy   i remember there were dorks that tried to find the blair witch thinking it was true
Feb 19 2011,negative,i remember the suspense of this one at the movie theater  now i find it positively goofy   i remember there were dorks that tried to find the blair witch thinking it was true
Feb 18 2011,positive,a dark shadow of a film that plays off the suspense of the moviegoer without effects or even a glimpse of special effects ecstasy  the films characters and the simple setting bring your fears to life with strong convincing performances based solely on their scared reactions  if you didnt like it its obvious you have under looked it or over looked it as a shaky cam vomiting mess
Feb 18 2011,positive,it was ok defiantly to me more comical than scarybut wouldnt say it suckedprobably wouldve gave a 3 12 if they wouldve killed the annoying bitch  if they showed something other than just the main 3 people in the film not for anyone who hates slow moving films lol
Feb 17 2011,positive,to those with a big imagination this movie is terrifying if you really immerse yourself into it its because the movie forces the audience to become involved in the movie going experience so whether or not you will like this movie relies entirely on yourself and your imagination i think that the most effective aspect of this movie is the fear of the unknown nothing is more frightening than being terrorize by the unknown force that you dont know where to escape to and how to defense yourself to and become the manipulation of your deepest fears and how pitiful and helpless the 3 people in this movie have become agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives
Feb 17 2011,positive,revolutionary film with found footage and viral marketing very good
Feb 17 2011,negative,this film doesnt live up to the hype i was waiting for it to get scary then it ended  heather is so damn annoying
Feb 16 2011,positive,i love this movie original and a natural eerieness to it thats great
Feb 15 2011,negative,i still have a hard time understanding how people found this so scary
Feb 14 2011,negative,its an onetrial experience at the movies either you will find it modestly scary or extremely boring and painful to watch either way theres absolutely no replay value  the movie offers nothing for you to come back there
Feb 11 2011,neutral,all for myself in my room wanted to see a scary movieand what a disappointment  story sucks nothing scaryno pretty women 
Feb 8 2011,positive,for an independenthorror movie it was really good this movie is definitely jampacked with the right amount of suspense and horror the pov camera shots were what made me off the edge of my seat its like theyre not actors now i saw this movie at a young age but it was still appealing to me the writers did a very good job with keeping me hooked until the end its a mustsee for horror movie goers the only thing that shouldnt come up is a sequel or a remake because this movie just stands alone as one of the best independent horror films of all time the only bad thing i can say is that at times it was a little bit confusing for me but other than that it was definitely worth watching
Feb 7 2011,negative,not scaryjust a bunch of kids running around a forest screaming a lot boring
Feb 6 2011,positive,my kind of a movie grows so creepy and chilling towards the end watch it alone for the best results 
Feb 4 2011,positive,dont believe people when they tell you that this movie is boringits because they dont want to understand how scary this movie really is 
Feb 4 2011,negative,not scary one bit its boring too
Feb 2 2011,positive,overrated but still a great movie nonetheless    review coming soon
Feb 2 2011,positive,convincing it changed the way that small time film makers can achieve great success it uses natural acting and good use of cues to make us believe something real is going on  they never get too close or reveal too much of the witch elie kedward always an alien presence  magic
Feb 2 2011,positive,scary  terrifyingly real and filmed with only a handheld camera    blair witch project proves to be a satisfying horror film  without all the stupid antics most horror films have its fun  suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your seat to the very last second a
Feb 1 2011,neutral,an interestingly made wannabe horror movie but there was barely anything here to call it a horror film its more of a suspense thriller though i will admit this was pretty spooky but paranormal activity was much better it was fun but not worth it to buy
Jan 31 2011,positive,the best part of this movie quite honestly is that it relies purely on the movieplot itself and your imagination for the horror aspect to kick in no dependencies on japanese vengeful spirits or disfigured zombies to create that sense of fear
Jan 30 2011,positive,movie scared the  out of me and still doeswell done and totally creativeloved it
Jan 29 2011,neutral,not that scaryjust saying
Jan 26 2011,positive,handheld camera trailblazer that paved the way for a new style of horror
Jan 25 2011,positive,a creepy mockdoc the blair witch project is a unconventional horror film that still scares audiences 11 years after it was released
Jan 24 2011,positive,we as a movie going public are no strangers to the mockdoc style film shot mostly or almost entirely from a pov perspective these films aim to draw their audience into the film by giving the audience the chance to view the film through the eyes of the cameraman most of these films featured an almost entirely silent cameraman that filmed the characters through a pov perspective but the blair witch project ups the ante by taking the mockdoc genre and turning it on its head in this film the actors are the cameramen and they for almost the entirety of the film are left alone in the woods to shoot this masterwork of modern horror the blair witch project tells the story of three young aspiring film students who are trying to make a documentary about the town of blair and the legends and folklore that surround it the films begins with them getting ready for their journey and in some spectacularly acted scenes that feature almost nothing but imrpovised dialogue we are introduced to the three students once in blair they ask around the town about the legendary blair witch that haunts the forest and once they feel they have enough footage of the town they begin their trek into the woods here the film takes its viewers on a terrifying journey that hardly lets up until the credits roll the blair witch project is proof that it isnt what youve got thats important but what you do with it the evils that haunt the forest are never shown to the viewer but are instead kept in the dark to torment the three students from the shadows the cracking of trees the laughter of children the distant screams of one of the students after they go missing is the closest the viewer gets to understanding the evil in the film what is the evil is it the blair witch the evil old hermit or something else entirely we the audience never know and its that kind of vagueness that makes the movie all the more terrifying when we hear things go bump in the night all we do is hear them the three film students are being tormented by an entity they can neither fight or see and we are being tormented with them blair witch may be notorious for its advertising campaign and may be universally despised by those who cant appreciate what it set out to accomplish but for true fans of the horror movie genre this is one film that simply cannot be passed up the great acting great dialogue and absolutely terrifying scares make this a truly scary film and one of the best examples in the entire horror movie genre
Jan 24 2011,negative,this movie was the worst movie ive ever seen
Jan 22 2011,positive,the blair witch project is by now almost a cliche its mockumentary stylings are now a standard in the horror genre producing some of the most wellreceived horror flicks of recent years whether commercially paranormal activity or critically last years odd the last exorcism  even with all the hype far past ripe the blair witch still stirs up plenty of chills and thrills and the mockumentary elements work extremely well certainly much better than in many of its subsequent imitators    whats perhaps most surprising about the films engrossing nature is how little is actually shown  aside from the shakycam cinematography and the engulfing darkness nothing particularly supernatural or unsettling is ever shown onscreen  there are strange happenings and chilling sound effects but until the films last moments nothing truly terrifying is shown  however thats not to say the film isnt scary because it is  its deeply unsettling a triumph of ambience    the three actors certainly deserve accolades for their performances  they capture the nonchalance and growing terror of their everyday teens perfectly and its fun when heather donahue dons the narrator persona in their supposed documentary  the performances are impressive in their notflashiness and they serve as a clear template to the fine work seen in more recent similar fare    while theres no longer a tinge of debate about whether the film is real or not the blair witch project still serves as a definitive horror experience one of the most original and exciting entries in the genre
Jan 22 2011,positive,creepy one great
Jan 21 2011,positive,creepy and impressive acting
Jan 19 2011,negative,an hour and a half of my life i wont get back
Jan 19 2011,positive,this low budget horror film is brilliantly made from the style it is shot in to the actors in it the team that have worked on this have put thought into the editing and subject matter to ensure the blair witch project is suspenseful and intense and it is low budget horror films have a sense of authenticity that are all but lost from big budget hollywood films these days it is this authenticity that gives films like the blair witch project and paranormal activity such a chilling atmosphere and successful execution of the less is more in horror
Jan 18 2011,positive,josh ok heres your motivation youre lost youre angry in the woods and no one is here to help you theres a witch and she keeps leaving shit outside your door theres no one here to help you she left little trinkets you took one of them she ran after us theres no one here to help you we walked for 15 hours today we ended up in the same place theres no one here to help you thats your motivation thats your motivation besides the house of the devil the blair witch project is my favorite horror movie made in the last 15 years there is something to be said for a movie that can show absolutely nothing and still be as scary as this movie is watching the actors its actually believable that all this happened it doesnt at all seem like they are acting it seems like they are in a screwed up situation and they are reacting like anyone would i love how the movie is shot i like the shaky cam it gives the movie a much more real feel other than the ending my favorite part of the movie is the interviews they really set us up for everything that is going to happen throughout the entire movie the father son fishing interview was by far the best it was funny and just like real life sme people believe some dont this is a very under appreciated movie
Jan 18 2011,positive,never before had a film with no onscreen monsters scared the living daylights out of me it truly was a masterpiece unto itself it speaks to the heart of what scares us ourselves
Jan 17 2011,positive,a pioneer the first horror film of its nature faux documentary which ended up inspiring countless others after it effective and spooky
Jan 17 2011,neutral,not a very good movie or even horror movie the only thing it had going for it was its realism
Jan 16 2011,positive,in my opinion this is one of the all time greats and redefined the scary movie  what i like most is the concept of video tape footage being discovered of three missing students that were making a documentary about a witch in deserted woodland there tapes start out as a fun adventure into the woods but then decends into terror  the film works so well because the setting becomes unsettling and your seeing it from their point of view of them the scenes at night are terrifying when you know something is out there and you can hear it somewhere in the woods heather donohue was a superb choice as one of the students as she comes across as irritating which adds to the tension of the whole film  the ending i think is original and brilliant    if i was to be picky i would say does a camcorder battery exist that lasts for three days and when the film really does descend into terror towards the end would you still be filming it if you were in the middle of it   anyway i thinks its a great film and a classic that will remain timeless i know the blair witch project was not everyone√¢tms cup of tea but i love it
Jan 15 2011,positive,the problem with this movie is that people are either going to love it or hate it if you grew up on films like saw hostel cabin fever and the hills have eyes walk away now but if you want pure raw terror which lets your imagination do all the work this is your movie  as for myself bwp scared the shit out of me
Jan 13 2011,positive,some may think its cheap and a lazy attempt at a horror film but frankly its one of my favorite horror movies of all time
Jan 11 2011,positive,the best horror movie ever no special effects its all about the eerie atmosphere and imagination of the audience which makes it scarier brilliant
Jan 11 2011,positive,what to sayill think twice before going into the woodsor maybe not even thatthis is some good stuff
Jan 9 2011,negative,really  was i getting punked
Jan 8 2011,positive,a really good horror movie with a fantastic last half despite a slow start
Jan 7 2011,positive,admirable low budget production that made a ton of money from the well timed and mysterious advertising campaign the movie has a lot of cursing and its easy to say its not scary after youve seen it but during a first viewing of it your imagination runs wild and i think we shouldve seen the witch at the end but i respect their choice for not showing it
Jan 6 2011,positive,pretty creepy when you first saw it ages ago the novelty has worn down since
Jan 5 2011,positive,this film had alot of people ovrwhelmed with disappointment over but i really enjoyed it i think people expected more horror action in this film but i thought it did well to build tension with the characters getting deeper into the woods and squabbling over how to overcome the situation of being lost the tension between the characters is so realistic it becomes almost unbearable to watch and you end up feeling scared for them at the prospect of not being able to find their way out the subtle imagery of the rock and stick formations are mildly creepy and the final scene could have been cheesed up so badly but thankfully refrained from it in place of something that is subtley terrifying a very solid and ridiculously simple piece of film making which added something startlingly original to such a tired genre
Jan 3 2011,positive,very original  hated part 2  we need a part 3 about ellie
Jan 2 2011,positive,i believe it was a good movie but i was confused during a lot of this movie but it could of been the fact that i was up late and i did not want to wake my parents
Dec 31 2010,positive,sort of started the thing i liked it mainly for the atmosphere
Dec 30 2010,positive,creepy scary film is not going to be scary to everyone but to those with a big imagination certinly be very scared especialy by the end
Dec 29 2010,positive,if you go down to the woods today
Dec 29 2010,positive,after the 31 movies of halloween review spectacular i had a few months back i decided to take a few  months off from writing i scribbled out a review or two since then but i havent figured out a schedule but for now here is my review of the blair witch project        in 1999 i begged a group of adults to buy tickets for my friends and i to see the blair witch project we gave them the money and they bought each of us a ticket it was amazing i was about to walk into the most hyped movie of the fall yeah i admit it i was taken by the publicity that surrounded this movie it was like the first viral marketing campaign everyone had some sort of sneaking suspicion that this movie was real that all of the events were real        coming out of the theater that night i realized that i was terrified it wasnt just hype it was the way the movie was filmed and that ending that ending scares the crap out of me i really dont like it it stays on me because of that i didnt want to rewatch the movie but i decided that it was time to revisit the wood of the blair witch as seen through the shaky camera lens of three unwitting amateur documentary filmmakers so i dusted off the old dvd case and pulled out the blair witch project i actually received the dvd as a gift years ago and hadnt opened it its been sitting in my closet for the longest time         the blair witch project is a found footage movie about three college students that go into the woods in burketsville maryland to document the tale of the blair witch needless to say they run into some trouble and have to try and survive each otheri mean the blair witch i think maybe who knows        first the bad the movie runs about fifteen minuets too long i didnt remember the movie having all of this senseless dialog padding out its run time its not horrible but it could do without         the movie is creepy all the way from the beginning to the end there is no soundtrack and the movie just jumps into it you have what appears to be raw found footage the subtle noises in the background are the scariest parts in the scene where the tent gets shaken there is someone saying something very faintly in the background but its not quite audible you have to really lean in to try to hear what they are saying and then you can hear children laughing and playing that whole setup and scene is the second greatest part of the whole experience         the ending is the best part of the entire movie the body of the film works solidly enough to lead up this really scary ending the entire sequence is one of the best  planned out pieces of horror cinema in a long long time the movie leaves you with all sorts of questions and that is the beauty of it the viewer isnt supposed to figure anything out about the blair witch we are only seeing what the young adults in the movie are seeing         the gore in the movie is pretty nonexistent the film relies mostly on the subtle scares to get you there is a scene with a few pieces of what looks like a molar and something nasty but its really fast        if you havent seen the blair witch project then you should it is a solid film it didnt need a sequel and it doesnt need the scottish remake that is currently being produced the movie is a perfect piece of horror cinema and stands alone anyone who says otherwise is just butthurt that they were taken in by the ruse the movie played prerelease i can safely say this movie gets a good 8 in my book this is a scary fng movie it definitely has a place in the 1001 horror movies you need to see before you die         tell me where you are josh        sd
Dec 28 2010,positive,viewers without imagination will find the blair witch project to be an overrated preparanormal activity however anyone else can find the film to be truly frightening
Dec 28 2010,positive,ooh very creepy and only one moment of gore it inspired a load of other mockumentery films which were very good but not quite as good as this chiller genius
Dec 26 2010,positive,a truly frightening film i saw it not long ago and it was very interesting when three student historians went out in the woods to research about this mysterious blair witch and day after day things get worse the woods are haunted and they loose their map and eventually one of the historians go missing    i think its an original idea of using actual camera footage instead of those realistic film stuff  i like how they handled it  although what annoyed me the most was that at times the quality was poor and i couldnt quite hear what they were all saying and i thought the quality couldve improved although this was one of the earliest films to use found footage and it was good at its time    this film later inspired oren peli to write and direct paranormal activity
Dec 23 2010,positive,this film is more legendary than its subject fantastic bravo
Dec 22 2010,positive,a truly frightening the blair witch project is the scariest film ive ever seen if you dont like my opinion watch it alone in the dark its truly frightening and disturbing because like so many others have mentioned its a fear of the unknown that makes this a compelling film its a first rate low budget thriller and well deserving of the crtical acclaim it received while i typically dont like the horror movie genre this was truly effective and scary very scary
Dec 22 2010,positive,amazing what you can do with a video camera and a whiney cow
Dec 21 2010,positive,a captivated story and plot and is scary to about the things unknown in the woodsit was the first of its kind and showed what these types of movies are it shows a ton of raw emotion which makes this movie orginal and classic but makes you never want to camp again the violence level is low but a great ending and many of things that will not make you sleep againor go into the woods it makes you beileve in both ghost and witchs i say buy and watch in the dark
Dec 21 2010,positive,nothing happens yet i cant look away a story that is gleefully mysterious and performed with bloodcurdling skill recommended for fans of arthorror and independent works alike
Dec 19 2010,negative,a less courageous cousin of cannibal holocaust which basically amounts to a bunch of young adults wandering around in the dark screaming with a shaky video camera a marvel of marketing and good ad campaigns for a completely uninteresting film
Dec 17 2010,positive,love this movie i know its not everyones type of movie but i always went camping when i was younger so it scared me
Dec 14 2010,negative,i queued this up on my netflix because i have only seen the film once and since i was 12 upon my first viewing i simply wrote it off as garbage i received the dvd in the mail today and quite excited to rewatch the film now that i am older and appreciate cinema more verdict it is still a waste of time normally films with an 85 minute run time seem to end too soon and time just flies but while watching tbwp i kept looking at how much time was left because i could not wait for the movie to end there isnt really any build up or suspense in the movie and the climax if you want to call it that was a complete joke i know some people will say i am just bashing the film because of lack of blood not much really happens and it never shows the witch but that is not the case at all i genuinely thought this movie was boring and having 2 people running around for the last 10 min of a film screaming at the top of their lungs is simply laughable knife in the water is a slow moving film too and this movie makes knife in the water look like hard boiled
Dec 13 2010,positive,one of the scariest movie
Dec 12 2010,positive,an original and exciting way to make a feature film its fodder for parody films nowadays but people forget that this movie scared the crap out of people when it first came out and it was the first of its kind as a film it may only get 3 stars but as a culturally significant work it would get 4 35 is my overall rating
Dec 8 2010,negative,lame but the documentary was so good
Dec 6 2010,positive,genuinely frightening
Dec 5 2010,positive,one of the best horror movies of all time
Dec 4 2010,positive,good at building tension and fear
Dec 4 2010,positive,three film students hike in the maryland woods to do a documentary on the local legend of the blair witch  rare horror that does provide some legitimate scares  proof a film can deliver on a razor thin budget
Dec 3 2010,positive,entertaining a little bit scary
Dec 2 2010,positive,25 movies that changed the world  in alphabetical order    3 the blair witch project    what did it do    it started out as a bunch of documentary footage found and compiled into a film convincing the world that these 3 kids really did go missing at the hands of a witch it was revealed a day before its world release none the less that it was all a hoax it introduced the shaky handheld camera technique a way of providing realism and gritty horror virtually placing the audience amongst all the mayhem    what did it change    the attitude of movie studios to use the internet to promote films ever since the web has been used as a tool to promote early buzz spread rumors and create stories about the movies months or even years before it is released it paved the way for cloverfield and paranormal activity and influenced a generation of filmmakers to take their home video camera and wander off into the woods  and that was all they had to do to become filmmakers
Nov 28 2010,positive,a definite classic the blair witch project is terrifying and completely original your horror will build and build until the most imaginative sensenumbing conclusion in all of horror film history this classic starts slow and is extremely raw but only adding to the realism that waits in the last twenty minutes of the movie the blair witch project truly proves many critics theory that the unknown can be a thousand times more horrifying than what can be shown on screen
Nov 28 2010,negative,some tense moments except you dont know what the fuck is going on not scary in the slightest
Nov 27 2010,negative,it was startling but not scary and doesnt explain itself which bugged me
Nov 24 2010,negative,i couldnt force myself to see anything scary in the beautiful forest this was filmed in
Nov 22 2010,positive,good film as just a film but its more in the fact that it sparked up the now not so uncommon movie type in which the movie is recorded first person by one of the characters
Nov 22 2010,positive,scared the absolute shit out of me
Nov 20 2010,positive,easily the scariest movie ive ever seen im serious i had nightmares   but some could argue that nothing happens you dont see anything itss boring all the characters do is argue the camera keeps shaking and its slow theres no violence or blood   but you obviously dont get the point then ill admit this movie dosnt flat out make you jump it uses atmosphere and noise to scare us and leaves us with an unsettled feeling afterwards   in the end its an amazing movie the actors are spot on and very convincing the atmosphere draws you in and the ending only haunts for days after the characters are very likeble and you dont want to see them get hurt and in horror movies thats rare   but you must remember this movie is not for everyone a lot of people have proplems with this movie and thats ok   to end this review if you havent seen it you should its very very good but be sure to not let your expectations be big go watch it with a open mind
Nov 20 2010,positive,to be honest it was fukin scary that time
Nov 20 2010,negative,hate this movieterriblestay away
Nov 18 2010,positive,you dont always need blood or gore for a movie to be a horror film seeing how scared they were gave me chills very realistic too although the shaky camera movements can be a bit annoying still the movie was good its either a like or hate film
Nov 14 2010,positive,the last ten minutes are nothing short of terrifying
Nov 13 2010,positive,i never found this movie scary but its original and the woods atmosphere is just creepy a decent horror movie
Nov 13 2010,positive,the thing that gets me about this film is that you never actually see the witches its so creepy and chilling and it is hands down one of the best horrori guess thats what we should call it flicks of all time
Nov 13 2010,negative,not scary in the slightest
Nov 10 2010,neutral,ive already watch this one but what happen after
Nov 10 2010,neutral,a total hitormiss movie and i missed completely missed it where in the state of maryland can you hike for a week and not cross and road or trail nowhere and why in the world would you not follow the river to civilization to ensure youre not walking in circles and why are they sometimes following and trail and sometimes bushwhacking and why dont these people eat and why do they swear so much    and since theyre trying to act realistically but i cant take them seriously the tension doesnt work for me a few of the night scenes are indeed fairly frightening yet the ending just doesnt work since my imagination doesnt care about a witch that doesnt exist i cant picture what its supposed to look like for all i care elvis could have been the blair witch    its still a good premise for a movie though but dang it has to go somewhere and not just degrade into profanity and melodramatic screaming this really is just a dodgy movie filmed in a state park
Nov 10 2010,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen i wasnt scared at all just really annoyed     grade f
Nov 8 2010,positive,this is actually a very effective and scary horror film it doesnt deserve all the hate it seems to get
Nov 8 2010,negative,innovative but that doesnt make the proceedings cool
Nov 8 2010,positive,pretty scary movie to watch alone in a dark room and you cant deny the influence its had
Nov 7 2010,negative,good at the time not now
Nov 6 2010,negative,worst film ever do i have to give it any stars
Nov 6 2010,positive,daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez turned the horror genre on its ear with their 1999 release of the blair witch project by creating a whole new subgenre the found footage genre love it or hate it it sure makes for some interesting films and no one can contend with the fact that the blair witch project is a true original its a film that plays totally with the psychology of the viewer and uses very simple objects and settings to scare you its all quite simple and brilliant if you ask me the blair witch project is also a classic for being the first of the late 90s films to really tap into the new media emerging at the time churning the hype machine this new thing called the internet like no other the blair witch project will always remain a game changer no matter how you feel about the final product personally i love this camp fire story come to life and embrace it in all its freedom and creativity
Nov 6 2010,positive,this movie was a pretty scary one it kept me entertained throughout the entire thing the only thing that was dissapointing was the ending
Nov 5 2010,neutral,maybe im too much of a nerd but i saw even more potential in this im not quite sure exactly yet what could have been done  but this could have been truly great and scary
Nov 4 2010,neutral,excellent premise and execution cheesy story and scares
Nov 4 2010,positive,simply one of the most overrated films of all time     its obvious how they managed to create suspense and mystery by not showing the witch in any form or symbol mostly by the fact that they had a really tight budget to work on it goes back to an old clich√£ of the good kind never show the face of the films main antagonist always hide it in the dark because its your imagination that makes it more terrifying than how it could ever appear visually and it gives the film a sense of reality which will transcend into the viewers minds effectively    while its not the first found footage film it beholds an original idea and has an interesting premise but there is a line between whats effective enjoyable and overall excellently executed and whats lacking annoying and feels like a waste of time the blair witch project is barely crossing over that line    its creepy during the night scenes ill give it that but it suffers from dragging scenes obnoxious screaming nonexistent narrative and shaky camerawork the kind of camerawork that many hollywood productions seems to use without logic ill admit it gives the film a documentarylike atmosphere and a realistic tone but i hate it i dont deny that it fits into this kind of film but its just that i find it to be nothing but atrocious handheld filming is the worst kind of filming in my book especially for a film production thats my statement and i stand by it    but on to the film itself only see it if youre curious if you want to see something thats more worth watching the blair witch project is not going to live up to its hype
Nov 3 2010,negative,nothings happening nothings happening its over everyone in the theater looks pissed off family guy cause thats how awful this movie was
Nov 1 2010,negative,lame couldnt tell what was going on all you need to make this movie is a recorder and woods then wait til dark and start running around screaming barney the purple dinosaur is scarier
Nov 1 2010,positive,goes from being intensely creepy to scaring the crap out of you by the end
Oct 31 2010,neutral,too much shaky camera footage and pointless arguing not enough creepy haunted woods  i very much admire the realism of this movie but as a horror film it fails to fully pull me in because a majority of the time i dont understand why theyre so scared  i wanted more background information and i wanted to see something more than oddlyplaced rock cairns and stick people in trees  some of the noises were a bit chilling but they usually didnt last long and were often faint enough that the protagonists talking and movement drowned a lot of it out anyway  im very much a fan of terror of the unseen but i think even the slightest glimpse of something paranormal or otherworldly would have made this movie so much better

Oct 31 2010,positive,this is one of my favorite films to watch during halloween the film is very realistic creepy and entertaining it helped stablish the found footage genre and it is certainly one of the best horror films of modern times and probably of all times    the film tells the story of three film students who want to make a documentary entitled the blair witch project about the local legend of the blair witch they start interviewing the locals about the legend and get all sorts of stories then they head to camp over the woods where supposedly the blair witch lives the blair witch was a woman who practiced witchcraft who apparently captured the town babies she allegedly lives in the woods where our three heroes set to camp the first couple of nights nothing happens but then things start to happen the film is told in a documentary fashion making the film all more scary and realistic     the film in entirity isnt really scary but the bits and pieces that truly are can certainly grow into you to give you nightmares specially the end scene that scene is truly intense and powerful and certainly the most terrifying of all and we also have a powerful iconic scene when heather aologizes to the camera towards the end in that scene her performance escalates into a bigger scale making her better in that scene than in the whole rest of the film that scene is probably the most powerful and iconic of the movie and as roger ebert put it it will give nightmares for years to come    we dont get to see the blair witch nor any of the other things that haunt our three protagonists but still she proves to be a very daring villain shes like the shark in jaws shes not seen for most of the film or rather none but her presence is inminent and she causes a bigger feeling of dread than if she had been present as the consensus says imagination can be as scary    so the blair witch project is one of my favorite horror films it is very realistic and despite its low budget and not use of any tricks the film is more scary than most of hollywood blood soaked films  my score 8890  my recommendation a must see for fans of horror
Oct 29 2010,negative,i was bored most of the time and bummed when i figured out it wasnt based on a true story the specail features were pretty cool because they incorporated the history of the blair witch
Oct 29 2010,positive,good considering the low budget raw
Oct 28 2010,negative,not even a good atempt
Oct 28 2010,negative,nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens the end
Oct 26 2010,negative,people clapped when leaving the movie theatre after this had finished dont know if they thought it was that good or if it was ironic  it was certainly the later from me it was to say thank god that overhyped rubbish is over
Oct 25 2010,positive,theres nothing scarier than being lost in the woods at night nothing this movie basically bluffs its way through with a handful of nothing and i highly doubt it would be as effective on a second viewing but on a first watch its terrifying seeing a forest at night  through a camera lens the nearest trees too starkly white in the limitedrange light and the areas beyond falling into darkness anything could show up out of the black anything at all this movie wisely knows that our imaginations will take this scenario and run with it once again proving that what is not seen is scarier than what is shown the most intense parts of movies like rec and 28 weeks later have followed the example set here is it a good movie im not sure characters are broadly drawn do stupid things and argue like idiots but does it scare absolutely im actually surprised i dont see more love for this film
Oct 25 2010,positive,i knew the ending before watching it and it still scared the shit out of me
Oct 25 2010,positive,i was really scared at the end of this movie and exhausted afterwards because of the suspense although the movie was pretty slow and uneventful until the last 5 minutes of the film i think it was a worthwhile way to spend  a few hours
Oct 25 2010,positive,very atmospheric creates an impressive phobia of the dark allows you to use your imagination
Oct 24 2010,positive,slow start but once in the woods it was unbelievably suspenseful and unlike paranormal activity you were scared and frightened
Oct 24 2010,positive,one of the best horror films ever going solely on emotions and what you never see
Oct 24 2010,negative,this was genuinely one of the worst films ive ever seen it wasnt scary it was boring virtually nothing happened for 40 minutes the kids werent likeable or sympathetic in anyway i literally spent the entire film waiting to be terrified and nothing happened there were a few noises from far away that werent particurlarly scary the ending was really confusing and dizzying and the one scary part josh screaming ended up just confusing me more i watched this with my mum who doesnt watch horrors as they do tend to scare her or make her jump and even she was disappointed with this i have no idea where the idea that this is the scariest film ever came from halloween is scarier than this and it predates it by 21 years avoid this boring dizzying unscary mess
Oct 23 2010,positive,one of the best horror films of all time
Oct 23 2010,positive,i still love iti dont care what you all think 
Oct 23 2010,positive,great concept at the time  ending gave me the creeps
Oct 23 2010,positive,way back in 1999 before paranormal activity was even conceived a couple of jackasses with a camcorder and a whacky sense of humor made a bundle of money by shaking it around a lot making little stick voodoo dolls and sneezing into the camera if you want me to be perfectly honest thats what happened here and people fell for it hook line and sinker but if i may stop being cynical for a moment that would be due to the fact this was genuinely scary film for a little while all things considered this movie certainly had me on edge and like deliverance made me think twice before going camping for a few months the production values shit but it wouldnt have worked in any other way and it makes for one hell of a unique experience so really how can you complain but so much about it but what exactly is up with this movie what makes this home made two hour snuff film a modern horror masterpiece was it the gritty realism the fact it never showed its titular villain the honest gut wrenching acting the masterful narrative structure are movie critics and audiences of the day pulling one over on you and being sarcastic in praising this lets take a for god sakes steady your fucking camera im getting nauseous look    as the movie begins three young film makers heather donahue michael c williams and joshua legend set out into rural burkittesville maryland to uncover the truth about the blair witch for a college project or something they discover a local hermit used to kidnap kids and bring them to his hut in the woods where hed force one to stand in a corner and listen as he killed the others and then would kill the child in the corner on orders from a witch in a nearby tree that was torturing him and refused to leave until he killed a bunch of them or something it all seems pretty stupid but a lot of the towns people give some good offsetting reactions when asked about the legend of the witch so now the three set off into the woods with their camera to find the blair witch the rest is all pretty predictable and famous by now they find stick voodoo dolls their tents get shaken around a lot at night they get lost and then disaster strikes the three are all pretty interesting and kept me entertained the whole time at least and certain parts like the tents suddenly shaking certainly got a jolt out of me but whats really impressive here more than the controversial ending is it from a film making perspective its low budget and yet at the same time you feel drawn into it and its one of the first movies to go for the whole this is real feel and one of the few still that did it successfully the movie understands it cant have drama or theatrics for audiences to buy into and be absorbed into its premise it has to be boring at times it cant have a lot of action it cant have anything that makes them suspend disbelief for too long and it cant become too wrapped up in the mythos its about the three kids not the witch and it does this better than cloverfield or whatever other shit you want to throw my way was able to    and i have to admit that halloween all those years ago the ending jarred me its become a big pop culture joke and most people have heard of its elements and especially that ending but i wont ruin it for people that havent seen it because my stomach dropped out in that final rattly scene it was about 11 o clock and i had to walk my dog and i definitely was a little on edge and had goosebumps staring up at the trees and the moon i understand most peoples complaints against this movie and why they may not have enjoyed it its a rather hit or miss experience but for me it was a hit and remembering watching it its one of the more unique viewing experiences of my life more so than many other movies i distinctly remember when i was watching it because it felt real damn it more so than paranormal activities i felt like a fourth party on their camping trip and i was absorbed into the universal experience    as a whole despite the way it split critics and audiences and there are many valid criticisms of the film the fact its still remembered still talked about still homaged or spoofed and most of all still ingrained in pop culture to me is a tell of its lasting power i guess if you really hated it you can say its still mentioned because its so comedically bad or because it polarized audiences so much but i say as long as there are some other people who agree with me it was one of the most inventive and just generally best horror movie of the past twenty years thats enough to say its remained in pop culture for more positive reasons but yeah if we can step outside of how i honestly enjoyed it and think its a good movie damn these guys hoodwinked the world this will never happen again so might as well enjoy itoh wait it happened last year well at least it took blair witch a longer amount of time to have the cashin shitty sequel green lit by greedy executives
Oct 20 2010,positive,marmite film i loved it and still do one of the only films to scare me every time i watch it for me its the best horror ever made and it started the handheld craze
Oct 20 2010,positive,blair witch is one of those movies that you either love or hate i personally think it is a well crafted little movie that draws the viewer in with its documentary style and then uses the viewers imagination to produce the goose bumps with just a few audio and visual nudges to get your imagination going the film lets you scare yourself for most of the proceedings so youre nice and warmed up for the spooky climax the cast comes across as real people and anyone who has ever been camping or hiking at night can appreciate the effect that spooky sounds in the distance can have a very effective little film for those who appreciate what it sets out to do
Oct 18 2010,positive,people need to realize that this movie is really creative and creepy
Oct 17 2010,neutral,slowpaced but gradually effecting experiemental horror flick was groundbreaking for its time one of the first movies to blur the line between reality and allusiona fact that should not be taken without discernment in terms of viewing the film very profane and a little lame at points but again gradually effective paranormal activity i thought was actually more frightening
Oct 16 2010,positive,a horror film presented in raw documentary footage  its suspenseful and chilling and it works
Oct 16 2010,positive,i saw this and i was like fer real nothing is even shown but i still got scared in some parts specially since i live in a creepy old mountain
Oct 15 2010,positive,fear at its most primal    i had the distinct benefit of seeing the blair witch project early in its run before it became a national phenomenon i went in with virtually no expectations and no knowledge of the story except that it was extremely low budgeted i did not for a moment believed the marketing lie that it was a true story if it had actually depicted the deaths of real people their families would never allow it to be released as a horror film not gonna happen    horror is a tricky genre truly great horror movies are few and far between i think it√¢s because fear is such a personal subjective thing that it√¢s next to impossible to scare a large group of people with the same idea  of course it doesn√¢t help that most horror movies are poorly written poorly acted dreck that just recycles what has come before    if you think about the truly classic horror movies they all work by depicting fear on a very basic primal level take the original night of the living dead which inflicted the zombie genre upon the world  it is about people trapped in a small space while dozens of reanimated corpses try to break in and eat them claustrophobia check fear of death check cannibalism check    next up is the exorcist fear of god check fear of satan check fear of something horrible happening to your child check    finally is my personal favorite horror movie the 1986 version of the fly fear of disease check fear of aging check fear of losing a loved one check fear of unwanted pregnancy check fear of getting your limbs melted off by a giant insect double check okay maybe that last one is a little less universal    anyway back to the blair witch project the basic premise of getting lost in the woods strikes right to the heart of universal phobia add on the notion of unseen tormentors stalking you as you slowly lose your mind from fear hunger and exhaustion makes a potent mix of terror    again i can√¢t stress how much hype ruined this movie for some people seeing it with an unsuspecting crowd and no expectations was one of the most terrifying movie experiences i√¢ve had  the documentary technique felt like a completely fresh idea back then and the fact that much of the film was improvised makes the performances of nonactors feel totally believable i knew people just like all three of those kids and there is not a dishonest or actorly moment between them  it all feels raw and credible that was also a time when cellphones and gps were not ubiquitous yet so whole premise felt plausible    many horror fans who had the movie overhyped to them were disappointed in the lack of bloodgoreactual footage of the blair witch what they don√¢t seem to understand is that the very absence of these things gives the film its power the second you actually show the blair witch she ceases to be an amorphous terrifying thing in the dark night of your mind and becomes just a lady in a costume    i also think the movie√¢s singular moment of actual gore is one of the best ever when the first kid disappears and you hear him moaning somewhere out in the woods it is severely creepy they√¢re searching for him calling out to him and they hear him moaning but they can√¢t find him anywhere and the whole time you√¢re asking yourself √¢why is he moaning like that√¢ then the next morning comes and the girl finds the package the presence of the package outside their tent is freaky enough but when she opens it and you can√¢t quite see at first and you just want a closer look and oh my god it√¢s his tongue  pardon my language but it√¢s just fucking awesome  people lost their shit in the theater when this happened then the fact that she is so freaked that she throws it away without even telling the other guy about it adds a whole other level of character development that takes it beyond the shock value    it all culminates in one of the classic final shots you hear the story in the beginning about how the blair witch makes people stand with their faces in the corner before she kills them but at the time the characters don√¢t take it seriously and you totally manage to forget about it then when the final shot arrives and you see the last surviving kid standing with his face in the corner sends chills all through me    all this praise aside i admit the movie has very poor rewatchability once you√¢ve taken the ride there is really no reason to buy another ticket
Oct 14 2010,positive,good concept for its time obviously made a profit makes clever use of the idea that what you dont see is scarier than what you do and thereby making the ending highly haunting
Oct 14 2010,positive,a slightly confusing movie toward the middle but still an ok movie kinda freaky at points good job
Oct 14 2010,negative,terrible what a stupid piece of garbage i always head and thought it was now i know for sure
Oct 12 2010,positive,screw it i liked it    it creeped me out got inside my head and interested me from a psychological perspective
Oct 12 2010,positive,this is seriously a great movie and people look past at it on what its supposed to be it uses sound and the unknown to scare its viewers and all though you never truly see the witch that made it all the more scarier the fear of darkness and what we cant see amazing movie and a cult classic
Oct 11 2010,positive,very frightening and suspenseful also the first mockumentary horror movie made
Oct 11 2010,positive,this is tough i feel like im the only person in the audience who has to give this movie credit because everyone else is furious at this film  the film has scares but does not know how to use them i still like it a lot see it on halloween
Oct 10 2010,positive,so scared when i watched it for the first timei were eight ok
Oct 10 2010,negative,i seen it and i think its oknothing speciall
Oct 9 2010,positive,a unique and original idea done very well
Oct 9 2010,positive,a landmark in not just horror movie history but movie history as a wholethe day scenes are just as if not more scary than the night ones as we are reminded of how terrifying the feeling of being lost and losing your mind is
Oct 8 2010,negative,i watched this movie and within a couple of minutes i realized i dont care enough about these characters to endure this half assed production  when the viewers are cheering for your characters deaths and get disappointed that you dont really know what happened to kill them youve made a piece of poop
Oct 8 2010,positive,this was a really crap movie right up til the last ten minutes when i got goosebumps   just a shame you had to sit through the rest of the movie to get to the good bit
Oct 7 2010,positive,the blair witch project is a horror film wrapped in an art film its highclass horror that doesnt rely on cheap jumpout moments and gory deaths its all about creating an atmosphere  and if youre watching it with the right people in the right conditions the atmosphere is terrifying
Oct 7 2010,positive,i pretty like this film a great documrntary style horror
Oct 3 2010,negative,not much to say about this film apart from it is a dire awful film and deserves none of the praise its received in the last 15 years the idea behind it is sound and that was what interested me to it but the execution for me was poor and in result left me bemused to how it made the cinema
Oct 2 2010,positive,the blair witch project has become a phenomenon over the years that it has been released this is because of a number of reasons firstly when it was released the makers pretended that it was actually real footage that had been found this stirred everyone up so much that pretty much everyone saw it many hated it for the fact that we never actually see the witch or in fact anything at all we see alot of shouting alot of running and at certain times nothing at all this all adds to the suspense one critic described the film as artless this is incorrect this was one of the original mocumentry films the film certainly looks authentic the grainy picture and the emotional dialogue makes you forget that it is actually a completely fictional film     the narrative follows a group of friends who decide that they want to make a documentry about the blair witch a supposedly mythical witch that inhabits the woods in blair a sleepy little country town once at blair the team start to question some locals who all seem to joke about the witch but all end up coming to the conclusion that she is infact real so they set off on into the woods to find this witch and thats when things start going wrong     the narrative is great and very entertaining at first but does eventually come to a rather uninteresting ending the final scene ruins the film for me i dont mind not seeing the beast for most of the film but eventually i do want to see the witch i feel that the film  comes across as pointless another reason that i lowered the rating was that the dialogue at first is good as the film progresses it just turns into endless screaming it started to grate with me and that is a serious fault
Oct 2 2010,negative,i have never been more mad at a movie except for transformers 2  god what a massive waist of time
Oct 1 2010,positive,an effective horror film with a good screenplay good actors and just a hell of a scare
Oct 1 2010,neutral,found footage has become a thing of the past very quickly and while it still has a small fanbase the films in this genre really arent all that great with the exception of a few films ie chronicle or cloverfield to have a couple the flare of this genre has really worn down it is more of a gimmick than ever and even the most average of moviegoers are catching on although this genre is on its way out lets take a look back on the film that made it all possible at the time the blair witch project frightened many people which i do have issues with but i will expand more on that later lets travel back in time to 1999 and discuss how this film holds up 17 years later    while i was too young to witness this film upon its original theatrical run i caught this film on dvd about 10 years ago having revisited a few times since then i have formed a very strong opinion on the blair witch project people once called this one of the scariest films ever made and while i can see some teenagers getting a few chills it just simply isnt that scary even to the people who it fooled into thinking it was actual footage i do not understand how they felt that way especially since it was released in theatres    clearly a theatrical film without any news or radio stations confirming these disappearances would have been fishy from the start mind you this was a huge selling point at the time so i can forgive it for selling the film that way sadly though the endless amount of films that preceded it whether it be exorcism films or time travel stories audiences simply were no longer impressed and became more annoyed personally with a great story and some clever techniques i believe this genre still has a few tricks up its sleeve but it will definitely be rare setting aside what came after it lets dive into why it was hit or miss from the start    at the time of release as stated above people called this one of the scariest films of all time to me that is absolutely insane the main plot that revolves around three teenagers heading out into the woods to document the myth of the blair witch is the most interesting aspect as each side character is interviewed as they make their way deeper and deeper into the forest the tension does build and you truly do feel like this is a real story that being said being the very low budget that it is hearing sounds and screaming instead of at least giving the audience a glimpse at what they see it just plain annoying at times yes given the budget at hand that is acceptable but it just makes the film a product of its time i would have called this film an average horror film if i were to have seen in back in 1999 but it is merely passable for this day and age especially considering the films that followed it    never for a second did i believe i was watching a documentary but the performances almost got me to that point there are moments where the dialogue feels very real and characters tear up while trying to get their words out easily the best portions of this film revolt around the performances at hand they are all believable to a fault and i found myself invested in these characters the only setback to that is the fact that you never truly get to see what happens to any of them the film is one great big tease that left me unsatisfied these actorsactresses give it their all and i commend this film the most for that    in the end i could never recommend this film to someone nowadays unless they are aspiring filmmakers who like to watch experimental films otherwise you are 17 years too late to the party at the time fans either loved it or hated it but i think the latter would be the majority today the blair witch project has a lot of promise and the coe idea of this film is commendable due to the fact that it sparked an entire genre for that reason alone i give this film more props than the actual enjoyment i had with it as i said if i were to have been in the theatre 17 years ago i would have recommended this film to many people calling it an average film worth checking out as for todays standards it is a merely passable experimental found footage film
Oct 1 2010,positive,such a phenomenon and well deserved
Sep 30 2010,positive,even thought the witch never appears in the film its a good film
Sep 30 2010,neutral,sequel was wayyyyyyyy better
Sep 29 2010,negative,i rarely turn off a movie before its finished even if it is bad but this was pure shite
Sep 28 2010,positive,the blair witch project did a lot of things that set it apart from every other title in the horror genre the funny thing is thats why the film is so scary okay lets name some horror movie stereotypes overuse of blood and gore jump scares and cg monsters these are nowhere to be found in the blair witch project    the blair witch project has almost no gore or violence for that matter the film actually shows us very little which can really mess with your imagination in a sense the bigger the imagination you have the scarier this film will be for example instead of seeing someone get tortured all the film does is make you hear the groans of pain can you say creepy    this film also does not rely on jump scares i think there was only one jump scare in the entire film and that was the tent attack scene this films scary moments stick with you unlike little jump scares to this day the apology video scene gives me chills     this is also one of the few horror movies i have ever scene in which you cannot see the villainmonsterwhatever it is again its really up to your imagination     i think that a lot of people even horror fans can agree that horror movies typically have bad endings when i was watching this film i was afraid that the ending would be terrible its not the ending was terrific it was frightening the ending really chilled me to the core     the lack of special effects and the way this film is shot mockumentary style also plays an important part in the scare factor for fleeting moments during the film i convinced myself that this thing might be real i think people should watch this on camping trips i really want to see how badly it will scare them    the one bad thing i can say about this film is that it seemed to short and it took a while to actually get to the scares i am aware that the beginning was necessary to set up the situation ground us in the folklore and show us that these three people are ordinary young adults but i would have liked it if this film gave us even more scares
Sep 28 2010,positive,much debated about flick that seems to be judged as either a piece of garbage or a classic for me its neither innovative yet contrived
Sep 27 2010,positive,yeah its cliche now but when this movie came out i was a believer and i thought it was very innovative when i found out how it was made
Sep 27 2010,positive,i actually liked this movie i remember a ton of people going to see it when it first came out and no one came back saying they liked it i thought it was good though
Sep 26 2010,positive,good movie loved the fact all those dumb asses thought it was a true story
Sep 26 2010,positive,i think i liked this a little more than the restits just a creepy feeling out in the woods at night knowing whos around you
Sep 25 2010,positive,brilliant horror exploiting the most useful and honest of all horror elements ambiguity desperation confusion
Sep 25 2010,neutral,quite boring at times i found out it wasnt real which ruined it and it wasnt that scary
Sep 25 2010,positive,terror arises from the mass hysteria of the three filmmakers is the blair witch real or is the audience witnessing three collegeaged documentarians going insane as they believe the folklore
Sep 25 2010,negative,yet another overrated movie like paranormal activityno scares no nothing
Sep 24 2010,positive,it only gets so many because when your watching it late at night on your own with the sound playing through headphones you get sucked in so the ending doesnt disappoint 
Sep 22 2010,positive,whats with that slime on your backpack    brash student filmmakers heather josh and mike march into the woods to make a documentary about the legendary blair witch whos credited with a string of heinous murders dating back 200 years    the blair witch project is a triumph of creative imagination and cinematic ingenuity over a lowbudget and stale genre the film is gritty and shaky forcing the audience to use their imaginations as they are shown glimpses of witchcrafting tools and eery sounds the film is frightening in short    the blair witch project is a landmark of the genre and absolutely refuses to be just another silly horror film
Sep 19 2010,negative,2nd one was better then tthis one
Sep 19 2010,neutral,90 minutes of people bitchin and freakin out can i have my life back
Sep 18 2010,positive,this is the most chilling unpredictable horror movie that i have ever seen in my life
Sep 18 2010,positive,2 words my friends holy sht i dont like most scary movies but i love movies that screw with your head i can honestly say i had to sleep with the light on for about a month after i watched this this movie plays on mans oldest fear what we cant see these kids are walking around a forest that they know freaky stuff happens in  you know what freaky stuff happens to them this is a documentary style film for those who dont know just a heads up
Sep 17 2010,positive,all you have to do is imagine that it is real like any other movie
Sep 14 2010,negative,dint like the story line
Sep 13 2010,positive,yes this did scare me a little bit but it was really quite an interesting film
Sep 12 2010,positive,blair witch is the pioneer of mockdoc and will continue to give birth to movies with the likes of paranormal activity and the last exorcism and youve got to love it for that
Sep 12 2010,positive,i would probably only watch this once because you would know what to expect the second time and it wouldnt be as fun as the first
Sep 12 2010,positive,made me sickall the movin of the cameras
Sep 11 2010,positive,i do not kknow why but i found this to be the best comedy ive seen maybe ause the guys face is on the camera i dont know
Sep 10 2010,positive,awesome writing acting and one of the horror genres most brilliant concepts make this one of the scariest movies ive ever seen especially with the main threats actual existence remaining ambiguous throughout the film though beware of the shakycam even though i loved this touch i know many might not
Sep 7 2010,positive,i cant say that i loved this movie although i did enjoy it   my biggest complaints are the ones you have probably heard over and over again  some of the shots were pretty meaningless just quick pans of trees i know why they did this and i appreciate it i just couldnt deal with it at some points    a good portion of the film for me is reminiscent of the ghost hunters tv shows  character 1 what was that  character 2 did you see something  character 1 i dont know  character 12 spoookky ghooossst      one thing this movie did really well is build suspense the characters could be doing nothing of any real importance and my guts would turn into the gordian knot     the best parts of the movie for me at least werent any of the spooky witch stuff my favorite part was just watching the three main characters interact while lost in the woods so if there is a movie out that that is the blair witch minus the blair witch i would like to see that
Sep 7 2010,positive,wow a lot of people hate this     there were several reasons why i was apprehensive to watch this mostly because of the aforementioned hate by my peers but also due to the parodiesripoffs in the ensuing ten years and for the fact that i was told the ending around the time of its release    however this movie had two things going for it first i actually enjoy the shakycamfound footage genre a lot cannibal holocaust cloverfield and paranormal activity more on this later are all films i enjoy quite i bit i understand that theyre gimmicky and require a special kind of disbelief suspension but theres something terrifying about watching noisy digital video and fully believing that its real     the second thing this had going for it is that last year paranormal activity came out i saw it and it traumatized me for months and considering that film and this film are basically the same film i realized that i could possibly be terrified beyond comprehension    was i not as much as paranormal activity i dont want to make this entire review a comparison piece but these two movies are the same save for the horror element and the location you have the same formula in both movies theres the overzealous camera operator heather in this micah in pa and the smart foils who are seen oncamera more than the protagonists the crew here katie in pa and of course the terrifying antagonist witch here demon there both movies have pretty much the same plot points and they also both pay off in a very similar way    so after seeing the movie that undoubtedly inspired it do i enjoy paranormal activity less no im sure id still be terrified of it because it affects me in a different way despite being essentially the same movie    after seeing an arguably better film do i enjoy the blair witch project less no     i think it scared me less mostly due to the fact that i knew what was going to happen but i was engaged more possibly because the main characters are filmmakers and also because i think this movie possessed more verisimilitude than paranormal activity    it has to do with the subjective way the plot is given to you paranormal activity provided you with no escape showing the characters sleeping helplessly all night long while being tormented by the titular activity in this film you only get information when the characters are rolling the cameras granted you always know whats going on pretty much but there are several instances where youll be disoriented which will either increase your sense of terror or just piss you off    i like the subjectivity alot and it reinforces the metafictional aspect of the found footage genre information is shared when the characters care enough to share it and the whole cheap video aesthetic of the production is quite effective despite the constant shakiness    this sort of subjective nonlinear style though its been used so much now that its sort of gained linearity can be very offputting after all you never see the titular witch that may seem like a spoiler but if you know that going in i think youll enjoy the movie better i think its scarier that we dont have a payoff with some wicked witch of the west lady cackling around a cauldron the fact that the witch is more of a presence than a literal witch is exponentially more scary watch the main characters get lost watch them find weird structures watch them start to go crazy there is no witch in the woods the witch is the woods man and to me thats way more interesting i think the scariest part of the movie is when the characters find out theyve been traveling around in a circle despite going in one direction somethings fucking with them and you dont know what or why    you have to want to be frightened to be scared by this your imagination is your worst enemy here why do we go on roller coasters because we want to be thrilled if you go on one with football pads the threat is gone same scenario here if you tell yourself not to be scared you wont be     so do yourself a favor before seeing this movie remember that you will never see a corporeal blair witch there let the disappointment sink in and then watch it    what do you see what do you hear    better yet what dont you see what dont you hear
Sep 7 2010,positive,the blair witch project truly is one of the scariest movies ive ever seen its the original horror with the whole handheld camera scenario and is easily the best thats done it so far and i would even call it one of the all time greatest horrors due too its originality and effectiveness it truly is a horror that is horrifying    so its about three student filmmakers who travel to maryland with intentions of making a documentary about a local urban legend called the blair witch they are never seen again    one year later their footage was found and was then made into a movie the blair witch project    i first saw this when i was about 11 and i didnt like it at all infact i dont even remember finding it scary but when i recentley rewatched it about a year ago i found it to be extremely terrifying as i must have not understood what it was trying to show when i first saw it as this films goes on the supense really does build up and you can really feel the tension the funny thing is you dont even see much but its the ideas behind it that scare you and just how well its all acted from the cast the preformences were extremely beliveable eventhough most people are smart enough too know none of this is real the film is put together so intelligently that i felt as if what i was watching was actually all real    the thing is theres no computer generated effects no fake loud noises no stupid frights but if you really veiw this film the way its suppose to be veiwed you will see exactly how this is one of the scariest films ever made the thing with this film is that you cant expect your typical horror this is different then any horror it scares you with ideas and if you really focus on it it can really mess with your head    so theres people that wernt effected by this film at all and alot of people just hate it well i guess i can see why its not as good as the shining or halloween but it never tried too be however it did scare me more then both of them the people that wernt effected by this most probably watched this in broad daylight and talked shit the whole time and probably just thought it was boring so they didnt fully pay attention too it this movie needs to be veiwed in the dark with your tv on as loud as possible and you need to pay full attention to everything thats going on if you really follow the story and take note of everything thats happening you will slowly start to build up to the suspense and by the end you will most probably be scared out of your mind    i never thought this film would work on me after hating it the first time i saw it but you realy have to veiw this how it was suppose to be veiwed and like i said pay close attention too whats actually going on this is a film that had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through well after about the first 20 minutes my eyes just couldnt get away from the screen and when it got to the last half an hour i could fell my heart literally pumping i even felt quiet shaky if this film didnt scare you the first time i really think you should give it another go this is an originalclever and intelligantly put together horror that can really freak you out if you let it a masterpiece
Sep 6 2010,positive,it shows us nothing in return but the blair witch project shows us scary things we cant even see
Sep 6 2010,positive,low budget but big scares  essential cinema viewing
Sep 5 2010,positive,a brilliant film its slow from the start but as things get creepy it picks up one of the best horror films ive seen it scares just when it should not the type of making you jump just making you not want to turn the lights off
Sep 5 2010,positive,actually pretty good i thought took me years to see it because i couldnt be bothered before but now i have and i liked it it was pretty well executed in my opinion
Aug 31 2010,positive,one of my favorite scary movies well done
Aug 31 2010,positive,terrifying if you really immerse yourself into it having just recently watched it i can confirm its still creepy as hell this film just has this atmosphere of pure dread and its present after about the first 20 minutes all the way to the end  810  great
Aug 30 2010,positive,better than the bad reputation it gets
Aug 29 2010,positive,unsettling and ultimately terrifying the blair witch project lets its characters internal nightmare become the viewers this is horror at its finest
Aug 29 2010,negative,this movie was ever scary did not know why people made a big deal out of it
Aug 27 2010,negative,its anticlimactic crap that many dumbass americans mistook for a real event    granted its the first shakeycam film that came out much to my knowledge but that doesnt mean its gonna get any higher a mark by my standards    final verdict hey you can have a go at me anyway you want ill never change my mind about this movie but we can all have a laugh knowing the guys who made this movie are bathing in millions of dollars
Aug 24 2010,positive,a film with original suspense a great horror flick hitchcock would be proud
Aug 23 2010,positive,i have to say that i was quite disappointed beacuse i thought it was gonna scare the hell out of me although it isnt that scary it has a magnificent story line and the actors do an amazing job sometimes i forgot i was watching a movie i would call it more a thriller than a horror film ps im totally piced off with the razzie awards how could they nominate this movie for worst  picturex
Aug 22 2010,positive,okay i was very skeptical about this film  however in the proper setting it truly gets to you and you cant help but feel creeped out by the idea of what the students are experiencing  it helps to pay attention to the details in the beginning and then you will understand the ending
Aug 22 2010,positive,awesome moviei love movies like thiswhen it looks like someone is just holding the camerait was very creepy
Aug 22 2010,neutral,the blair witch project is definetly not the kind of film that will leave you scared out of your wits but instead leaves alot to the imagination  while most of the movie is spent in the dark leaving you blind while you hear bonechilling screams  panting you cant help but be intruiged  the ending gave me chills
Aug 20 2010,positive,this movie got a lot of negative comments from the users here which i dont get    the story is simple but scary as hell the filming style is genius and it held my interest all the to the shocking ending which i dont think a lot of people got    as i said the story itself is enough to scare you the story of the blair witch will chill you to the bone and leads to some very scary movie moments my only problem with the story is it is a little slow in the beginning and sometimes in between but its not that bad    the scares mainly happen at night which can be creepy as hell when your watching it in the dark during the day its scary to see whats left behind after the mysterious events during the night i highly recommend watching in the dark do it this simply heightens the experience and makes you get more into it     now the ending    im not going to say what the ending is but it shocked me its kinda sad and leaves you wondering what the witch even looks like or why she    i cant say    point is this is a great scary movie that will please horror and suspense fans theres some dull moments and the night scenes can get repetitive but its great none the less
Aug 19 2010,positive,this movie is film history the first ever documentary raw footage style film also made into a thriller and let me tell you it sets the bar for other film makers of course with the shaky camera comes the people who complain about the shaky camera you know what shaky camera haters shut up and take a gravol because its not over yet and boy when it was over it was over the kind of ending that makes you go wow what an ending  i think that often the best movies can go by without a soundtrack and this one pulled it off the actors the story i dont think i want anything to do with hiking or camping now this film was powerful an amazing not for the weak of heart
Aug 18 2010,positive,this isnt really a horror movie it is a suspense i dont understand why it is called a horror film but it is ingenius film making i really felt like i was in the forrest being chased byapparently a very hairy woman who is almost 100 years old even with their low budget they could have  shown the witch but they didnt and people dont seem to understand that it is all acted and scripted the acting is unbelievably convincing its great acting this film truly is a masterpiece too bad the second one sold out
Aug 18 2010,positive,this film is amazing only an idiot who knows absolutely nothing about how films are made would hate this movie i guess the world is full of idiots i blame micheal bay
Aug 16 2010,positive,this is a work of pure acting genius in this tale about 3 student filmmakers off to make a documentary about the blair witch they enter the forest to find her house and they get stucka and lost on the way the acting in this movie is top notch the characters are believable and this is a work of pure terror the ony drawback is that you never ever ever see the witch
Aug 16 2010,positive,its not thaat scaary tbh
Aug 15 2010,negative,retarded but kinda scary cause your not sure whats going on
Aug 15 2010,positive,a wellmade horror film with a creative breakthough a good sense of humor and best of all many effective chills to your core
Aug 13 2010,positive,its creepy simple and gives a variation to the horror movies
Aug 13 2010,positive,wow boy was i scared
Aug 12 2010,negative,part two was way better that sad
Aug 12 2010,positive,before this movie came out i remember watching a special on the sci fi channel about the blair witch that scared me to death because i thought it was a true story so right after that we went and saw the movie and wouldnt u know that days later our church went camping waaaay up north in the dark woodsneedless to say i had a hard time sleepingwhen i found out it wasnt real and i saw that the actors in a tv interview i felt relieved this movies paved the way for movies like quarantine  paranormal activity and is an instant horror classic
Aug 11 2010,positive,not as scary as i wanted it to be but it was good
Aug 11 2010,positive,i think this is how a horror film should be the fiend should always be as abstract and unknown as possible i liked it and i loved cloverfield however this particularly one felt more like a good youtube video and not something you would actually pay money to see
Aug 11 2010,positive,everyone should see it onceonce
Aug 11 2010,positive,was probably the only person in cinema who enjoyed this probably because had seen a documentary on sky1 before saw the film with same actors researching the blair witch  started a new genre in horror and is quite ground breaking in a few areas  end was quite creepy no matter what most people say especially if you understand the back story
Aug 10 2010,positive,goodoverated but the ending is good in the sense that its a good talking point and leaves you thinking
Aug 9 2010,positive,probably the most nauseating movie i have ever seen succeeds anyways both frightening and good
Aug 8 2010,positive,like the fact that your cant see the witch in the movie though to be honest it kind of annoyed me as well because i wanted to see what she looked like lol good movie though 
Aug 7 2010,negative,the shaky camera annoyed me
Aug 6 2010,positive,weve got to remember what this little puppy started  this film was ingenius and meditative and ive always admired its creepiness and audacity  one of the great horror films made
Aug 6 2010,positive,original better than paranormal activity quarantine and cloverfield this movie really started the whole first person camera movement and shaky cam stuff and this movie is scary original and gave me the chills
Aug 6 2010,positive,this chilling horror movie was very interesting the first half of the movie was pretty slow but it escalated into a very dark and creepy setting i can say that i was frightend for them and thier acting made it feel thier fears anger and frusteration i was kind of dissapointed that the witch wasnt filmed yet again would it be that scary if she was shown on camera
Aug 4 2010,positive,who would have known seeing nothing but a scared girl with snot dripping from her nose would be such a famous scary moment its not what we see that haunts us its what we dont the blair witch project does just that by keeping its villain in total darkness all the way up until the final credits what is left to the imagination is often more horrible to picture and directors myrick and sanchez create the perfect backdrop for a realistic scary old journey that will forever rank as one of the top scary movies    the directors do an excellent job blending documentary with horror elements the result is intriguing but just a little offputtingly slowpaced      the characters a far too dumb for their own good in this film at no point in anyones right mind would they throw away a map for laughs unless they turned out to be the killer little twists like these drag blair witch down to reality and hurt it from being a truly great film     we never get to see the supposed blair witch the writers and directors left it to the viewers imagination  something that is very seldomly used in todays cinema its always lame to see a story where the viewers know more than the characters and for once its the other way around in blair witch    heather donahue really stood out in my opinion she proved she has what it takes to be a female lead in a horror movie donahue has a very 60sesque feel to her acting its very classy and elegant but when she has to she can get down and dirty with the best of them    blair witch does a great job teaching its history early in the film to allow the viewer to learn a bit about its fake villain the documentary feel early really helps put us into the communities mindset on the history of the witch    the blair witch project will always be mentioned first among best movies made for a cheap cost it set the bar for a new generation of moviemaking but the few hiccups along the way pull it down from perfection
Aug 3 2010,positive,a very creepy and dark film that does not ever show the villian but just leaves you with knowing which is more scary seeing it or not
Aug 3 2010,negative,boring slow and not really frightening
Aug 1 2010,negative,stupid movie that made me dizzy to watchits called a steady camera not that hard
Jul 30 2010,positive,not really scary so much as interesting and original
Jul 29 2010,positive,an innovation in film making and the first in the realism by the handheld camera genre blair witch sparked films such as cloverfield paranormal activity and quarantine besides that it is a really well made film drawing on old hollywoods technique of building suspense without showing the ghost in the closet or the scary monster under the bed blair witch leaves much up to the imagination three filmmakers two are friendly one is an outsider as they become lost in the vast woods running low on supplies and turning on one another for a scapegoat they also come into contact with a series of strange events including footsteps all around their campsite piles of rocks and bundles of twigs that were not there when they arrived blair addresses all the audiences concerns by answering the questions of why are you still filming even though theres a witch after you wheres the confrontation towards your new member everything that youre expecting to poke holes in is covered and so its a character study in a way as the terror builds the truth comes out amongst them we may die not of starvation but by the hands of this thing thats hunting us the drive in the witch is fueled by joshuas disturbance of a scared cairn and in doing so is her principle target getting slimed and chased through the woods this ghost is furious all powerful and unstoppable exemplifying the best kind of fear the only reason i couldnt get into it fully was because i know none of it is real this isnt 1999 when the sensationalism was building for this film and paranormal activity scared the pants off me years later with its payoff still a true gem of horror film making
Jul 28 2010,neutral,the blair witch project    apart from fuking horrible camera work n quality of pictureits too damn boring   1st the jungle itself is soo dullall yellow n red only last 20 mins r scaryagain wats all da hypemany movies r better dan dis one recpacloverfield
Jul 27 2010,positive,back when hand held camera horror films were original mostly becasue of this blair witch gave you such a new experience of tension and fright holds up alright but i think it falls victim to the fact that there have been so many movies that followed in its footsteps the ending though is one of the best horror film endings ever
Jul 27 2010,negative,this movie sucks  the actors are ridiculous  the director gives us a terrible result  the script is for the trash  this is not convincing and realistic not for a moment  not to suggest for any reason  i was extremely disappointed  it is one of the very worst movies ive seen in my life
Jul 25 2010,negative,if not one of the worst films i have ever saw this movie is awful if you see this you must be desperate this is a must not watch avoid if ou can  it was all hype nothing more
Jul 25 2010,negative,one of the worst film frauds ever performed on screen stricly for zmovies lovers
Jul 25 2010,negative,i was expecting a chilling tale instead i got three kids messing around in the woods with a video camera it was very disappointing as i dont usually expect that the front cover of the dvd box would be the scariest part of the movie i was left waiting for something to happen which never did     the film was unrealistic and predictable two of the most important things not to include in a scary movie the students lasted an unrealistic amount of time without food and i had already predicted the ending 20 minutes into the film the endless camera shots of sticks made for a boring and uninteresting film with too many shouting and crying scenes to really ever catch my attention    i will never watch the second blair witch project because i am not putting myself through the same bore as i did with this one and i have heard from friends that it is even worse than the first one this film was so ridiculous that by the end me and my friends were all laughing at how stupid the whole thing was which makes me finish with the recommendation that you should never watch this film if you want to watch a spinetingling horror think of something else to watch instead
Jul 25 2010,negative, excellent   once in a year   once in 2 years   once in a lifetime   when you died
Jul 25 2010,positive,chillin freaky n well scary  qualityyy defo in my top 10
Jul 22 2010,positive,vastly overrated but entertaining enough
Jul 22 2010,positive,i obsessed over this when i saw it which was way back when everyone still thought it was real i loved it may not watch it now but back then  kicked ass
Jul 20 2010,negative,back in the day this was the paranormal activity scared the piss out of me at camp when i was much younger and tried  to watch it again this past halloween have to admit i was disappointed i guess movies are getting more gorry so movies like this seem very mild and somewhat boring
Jul 19 2010,neutral,disappointing  im big enough to appreciate that they had a good idea though
Jul 16 2010,negative,i will probably be making many people upset with this review    personally i have no idea what is so admirable about this movie i watched it alone nay tried my best to keep my eyes and mind focused on the screen of my tv and was more bored than frightened    or perhaps home videostyle is not for me  the poor quality of the shots drew my very sensitive eyes away from the storyline and got me feeling irritated and pissed    i was also very confused and had no idea what was going on    the only thing i can commend is that they made this movie a massive hit with a very low budget and that it was popular with people
Jul 15 2010,negative,horrible movie  so not scary at all
Jul 14 2010,negative,this was fantastic for about a minute then the movie started
Jul 13 2010,positive,better than i thought it would be although extremely annoying at times  the blair witch project spawned a phenomenon leading to many other firstperson survival horrortype films noteworthy among these are paranormal activity and cloverfield  i have to say though blair witch isnt scary at all idk why people were so freaked out by this film when it came out
Jul 13 2010,positive,its amazing that such a lowbudget movie without any special effects or even showing a single ghost manages to scare the viewer so crazilydont miss heathers apology at the endthis movie uses the same kind of narrative that movies like quarantine and paranormal activity did and turns out totally unpredictable in an awesome yet amateur way
Jul 12 2010,neutral,dont know why it didnt scare me more that it did but it still did especially in the end obviously but over all i really like that its filmed like its with a videocamera it feels more real when you unconsciously pays more attention to try to keep up with whats happening and also this is way better that for example cloverfield that is filmed in the same way but in a more hollywood style made with more money and special effects this creeps you out cause it feels so real
Jul 12 2010,positive,woof goddamn this movie is really fucking scary i mean it it was scary my god this movie was too frightning
Jul 11 2010,positive,a creative utilization of simple equipment and a small cast successfully manufacturing a new type of horror with a new type of atmosphere  reality  but was this film simply cheap or simply genius  one might argue that the blair witch project is a little of both
Jul 9 2010,positive,scared the living heck out of me this and paranormal activity its just to realistic for me lol
Jul 9 2010,negative,this film is extremely over rated realistically it is poorly acted and the story is boring and a little too farfetched for my liking
Jul 8 2010,positive,a must see master piece the blair witch project is easily the best film of its kind believable scary and clever this mockumentary successfully demonstrates the understanding of fear constantly playing with audiences mind the film allows the imagination to wander into dark places the combination of the alltoo real acting original script and inventive camera angles all allow this riveting film to become a classical monument within its genre
Jul 7 2010,positive,if only they never made the second movie
Jul 6 2010,positive,a definite classic the blair witch project is terrifying and completely original your horror will build and build until the most imaginative sensenumbing conclusion in all of horror film history this classic starts slow and is extremely raw but only adding to the realism that waits in the last twenty minutes of the movie the blair witch project truly proves many critics theory that the unknown can be a thousand times more horrifying than what can be shown on screen
Jul 6 2010,positive,a psychological horror ride that draws you in and throws you to the blair witch herself this movie was one of a few horror films to actually give me a true scare and the nightmares afterwards although i was somewhat let down by the ending i still loved it
Jul 2 2010,negative,only took me 11 years to get around to watching it its fecal matter with bad acting farts are more frightening
Jul 1 2010,negative,the only movie i want my money back on when i left the pics
Jul 1 2010,positive,we never see anything scary and thats what makes it so terrifying
Jul 1 2010,positive,terrifically scary using mockumentary style and imagination to define our own blair witch this film truly is one of the scariest to watch in the dark
Jun 30 2010,positive,an absolute classic the movie was short however every minute of it felt realistic and the amount of the movie left in vagueness allowed for so much imagination to take place letting you create your own horrible outcomethey could have embellished it some along with not making crappy sequels  however it is a chilling classic of why handycam movies are awesome
Jun 30 2010,positive,despite that fact that there werent many actual scares involved this movie was pretty good it relied mostly on creepyness to get its point across but also used tense emotions from the actors the depict a sense of frantic urgency it wasnt as scary as i expected but blair witch offers substance and emotion and creepy in the place of popout at you scares
Jun 29 2010,positive,all buildup with no payoff  the buildup itself is pretty good though
Jun 28 2010,positive,a simple yet horrifying tale that creates a realistic atmosphere it will keep you on the edge and will make you ponder about entering the woods again
Jun 25 2010,positive,good idea poorly done
Jun 24 2010,positive,i dont see how anybody hates this plus this is not overacting when you compare it to the quarantine remake  seriously watch it and youll see the overacting of one of the characters
Jun 23 2010,positive,cant go camping without a gun now
Jun 21 2010,negative,i found this movie overhyped for its time im sure it was pretty scary back then but it just dosent have the same effect as it does now filmed with a lowbudget home camera to make it seem more realistic i found this painful to watch but the thing is thats what it was meant to do a few people lost in the woods looking for some sort of ghost get lost in the woods thats pretty much it kids in their whining derperation going waaaah were lost stfu guy 2 your just making it worse but strangely there are actually some scary moments hit or miss the ones that hit really hit well though there were few
Jun 19 2010,positive,beyond all of the hype it had its a pretty solid movie
Jun 18 2010,negative,one of the worst films ive seen made me sick with the moving camera and anybody who thought this was actually real is a complete idiot but the people who made it might be geniuses i give them a lot of credit
Jun 18 2010,positive,compared to paranormal activity this is a very decent movie not scary yes it is sometimes thrilling but thats all the ending is totally rip off too way overrated fortunately i just saw this from dvd 2 for 20
Jun 17 2010,positive,spoilers          the best part of the movie is that we dont know anything about the blair witch even in the end if i knew that nothing would happen in the end i dont know if i wouldve been scared so i dont think if i watch it again that i would actually enjoy it
Jun 17 2010,positive,once more i give a much disliked film of mine a second chance this minimalist naturalist journey into terror is actually scary    the hype around it was actually of the right amount which made for a then groundbreaking internet media campaign if you could build up word of mouth based on a twist ending that works then why not build some on a unique horror movie    anyways the film immerses you into the blair witch legend  and the filmmakers attempt to capture it on film     because its a found footage film its actually realistic not just in the way its shot but also in the way characters interact theyre smart and the filmmakers know you are too so they allow you to imagine the evil instead of throwing jump scares at you the actors do a stellar job with portraying themselves  beyond cliche and being 3dimensional unleashing all sorts of emotions rooted mythology seems believable upon first viewing the ending truly scared me shitless and for a film to be freaky without being manipulative is an accomplishment    but its somewhat undone its kinda predictable despite that its effective but its only effective if you watch it alone at midnight and the effect would dissipate upon more than one viewing so not much rewatch value sadly before it taps into the fear film has us go through its actors trying to entertain us by acting like idiots and i find that not only silly but it also can get tedious    overall the blair witch project  not only lives up to the hype but this mother of the found footage film is one of the better ones
Jun 17 2010,positive,pretty good ending the girl screams too much i like the fact that it wasnt completely scary 100 of the time and that it wasnt super bloody
Jun 17 2010,negative,theres no denying that the idea behind this movie is genius however the film just doesnt reach the potential is should reach i watched this film and felt almost no emotion at all i desperately tried to feel involved with the characters and get into the story yet i never felt anything towards them perhaps im too jaded but from beginning to end i never felt a sliver of the terror the characters in the movie felt ill suggest people who are looking to be scared to watch this film since it seems that the majority of people were terrified and if youre in the minority like me youll just waste an hour and a half of your life which i think would be worth the chance to be scared maybe you will be scared maybe you wont but i can only say for myself that i wasnt
Jun 15 2010,positive,proves that the combination of a lack of actually seeing anything really scary and waiting for it to come out can be a really haunting mix  beautifully shot and the ending will leave you with the chills
Jun 15 2010,positive,no blood no violence no terrible action seens just the use of something that scares us all being lost in a place when it falls dark the blair witch project is probably the most successful horror film since the exorcist    tbwp revolves around three filmmakers that go out into the black hills near burkittville maryland to search for the locoal legend called the blair witch who is responsible for murders spanning 200 or so years the film starts out as you might expect soft interviewing people from the town and testing their equipment as they set off on their adventure things start out good until their hear strange noises at night then things get really interesting    my overall rating is 910  this film kept me scared long after definetly worth it
Jun 14 2010,negative,i really tried to like it  but i just couldnt  sorry
Jun 12 2010,positive,i would be hesitant to call this film frightening the ending is disturbing yes but not scary still it is an original concept the total secrecy that surrounds the characters attacker could transform into a very effective horror film if given another opportunity in my opinion the fourth kind came close to this but failed at the end i believe that rather than looking at the film as a means to scare it should be viewed as a documentary about the characters descent into madness and seemingly normal occurences and events that could easily be faked gradually break them in some places i did think that the characters had done something when the camera was off so that they would get some footage for their documentary   in conclusion this film is artistically eerie but scary i seem to be alone amongst all the people who gave it a good review in that it didnt really scare me
Jun 11 2010,positive,saw it in a german dubed version i would probably rate it higher if i had seen the original klang wie ne 3 fragezeichen kasette
Jun 11 2010,negative,so stupid and a waste of money
Jun 11 2010,neutral,when i was 14 it was pretty scary
Jun 10 2010,positive,amazing horror movie but i dont want to watch part 2
Jun 10 2010,positive,f the haters  this is one of the best horror movies ever made
Jun 9 2010,positive,78    i rewatched it and dropped it a couple of points due to all the annoying yelling and screaming
Jun 8 2010,positive,eh not really scary so much as interesting and original
Jun 7 2010,positive,i really loved this movie when i first saw it it was also  very scary the first time i saw it but now that i know when theres a scary part its just a ive seen all your ticks feeling still a good movie that fans of horror should see i think it wouldve been a lot scarier if you could actually see the ghost from time to time or if it was a monster that wouldve been cool i think its been 2 or 3 years since i last saw it
Jun 6 2010,positive,great first time through but not a very rewatchable movie  great to watch in the dark with the surround sound up
Jun 5 2010,negative,saw this at the theaters when it was initially released after hearing all the hype at the end my wife and i looked at each other with the same incredulous look it wasnt just bad it was stupidly bad at times it built up suspense very well but it never led to anything the ending was pure letdown as if the creators had run out of ideas and decided for a cheaply ambiguous escape truly one of the worst horror movies and one of the worst movies i have ever seen and ive seen thousands of them
Jun 4 2010,positive,i cnt forget the image in the ending normally some ppl wouldnt find the ending as scary if they havnt seen the whole movie cuz if u missed the interviews in the beginning w the townspeople u wouldnt understand the meaning in the end but the ending was like the only thing i found most terrifying
Jun 2 2010,positive,it scared me enough to rate it as quite good horror movie
Jun 1 2010,neutral,it scared me it might have been the fact that i watched it at 2 in the morning
Jun 1 2010,positive,this movie is ok but i found it left u up in the air to the ending at the ending of it
Jun 1 2010,negative,i didnt think it was that good
May 28 2010,positive,why did such a great movie get nominated for a razzie
May 28 2010,positive,one of the most unique horror films of all time scary and alot of fun
May 27 2010,negative,this is the worst film ive ever seen how can you be scared by a boring piece of shit like this  i have to admit that its a good idea but this was just too boring
May 27 2010,positive,scared me when i first saw it because i though it was all real but later when i found out it was fake it was like damn that blew the wind out of my sails    at the end where mike and heather are running downstairs and you hear heather screaming mike the first time i heard it i thought it was the blair witch shrieking
May 26 2010,positive,a scary suspensful and mysterious mockumentary
May 26 2010,neutral,great publicity which got lots of hype  re it being a true account
May 24 2010,negative,ummm yeahit sucked
May 23 2010,positive,three film students set out into the black hills forest to make a documentary on the legendary blair witch armed with a 16mm camera a hi8 video camera and a dat recorder every step word and sound is captured after wandering around the black hills forest heather josh and mike are cold lost and hunted finally one night after the last ray of light had left the forest black they were never to be seen again despite thousands of hours searching the black hills area neither of the filmmakers or any trace of their gear was found and the search was called off one year later a bag full of film cans dat tapes and video tapes were found the behind the scenes video footage and the film are cut together to make a fictional movie which seems more than real    this movie scared the hell out of me man one of the most extremely scariest and creepiest movie i have ever seen extremely real better than paranormal activity man very chilling very thrilling movie made me stick to the screen superb the ending of the movie was just awsome its a documentary style well the actors were good the night scenes scared me you never see anything but still makes you shake your boots lol i loved it
May 23 2010,positive,a camcorder film that every other camcorder film tries to copy but fails for me it isnt the scariest film of all time because i was never scared until the last 10 minutes of the film but seriously the actors in here were so believable that it makes you feel like it was a true story a memorable film but in my opinion its not as scary as other horror films
May 23 2010,positive,the scariest movie of all time nothing jumps out at you for cheep scares the movie keeps you terrified by not letting you know what is out in the darkness simple noises are some of the scariest parts like a cackling it all leads up to one of the scariest and terrorizing conclusions in recent cinema history
May 22 2010,positive,never has a movie fucked me up more well done
May 22 2010,neutral,didnt scare me and the ending was mournful
May 19 2010,positive,its been over 10 years since this film came out and i finally got to see it    it exceeded my expectations    the blair witch project tells about three young adults wandering into the woods of the former town of blair maryland they are making a documentary about the blair witch legend the group gets lost and experience many strange incidents     i cant really explain what happens in the movie it would give away everything plus its more about the experience rather than the actual story progression the actors are very natural in their roles and since this was made out to be real they really work heather donahue in particular is very good     this movie is not only scary but very smart keeping the strange occurrences offcamera is a nod to the old saying of less is more which is something that modern horror directors such as eli roth can learn from i highly recommend this film to any fan of horror movies    if youre going to watch it get into the mood believe every word of it its how it was meant to be viewed
May 18 2010,negative,most overrated movie of all time
May 17 2010,positive,i film that scared me and the first camcorder film i have seen the blair witch project is know to be the most successful film ever made but that was topped by paranormal activity though this film had some great frights even though i found the other to be average the scriped to the film was okay even for this type to film some plot holes are noticeable when it comes right around to the acting some of it was strong other times i found it to be a bit poor but when it comes to what ever is stalking them you never find out how or what it was that was following them it seems to be nothing overall it the best camcorder film i have seen so far it had some freaky moments and i recommend it
May 16 2010,positive,the story was good the filming well it did what they set out to do make people believe this really happened to some kids looking for the blair witch i liked it good for a snowyrainy movie nite
May 15 2010,positive,officially the scariest and most inovative horror movie of the last 20 yearscamping and self shooting hasnt been the same since
May 15 2010,positive,cheap made and good prob crap if watched a second time
May 14 2010,positive,truly scary more effective than any other horror film since
May 14 2010,positive,this film is da best around my family thinks its scary but its not omg lol xx
May 13 2010,negative,not scary at all 
May 12 2010,negative,first time i watched it i liked it nownot so much
May 9 2010,positive,aside from the historical significance when it comes to independent film financing and distribution this film is significant simply for being genuinely horrifying one of the top three most frightening films ive ever seen beautifully simple and effective
May 9 2010,negative,not as good as i thought but okay
May 8 2010,negative,one of the most overhyped oversold overacted pieces of garbage ive ever seen  even paranormal activity gets the reallife shaky camera bit better than this  boring stupid and completely lacking fright
May 7 2010,positive,i loved this movie for the fact that you have to imagine whats out in the woods chasing these kids around probably one of the best scary movies from the last 10 years
May 7 2010,positive,saw this at the flicks hype was amazing audience was jazzed movie sucked ass but the experience was great
May 6 2010,positive,great for what it was
May 2 2010,negative,honestly this movie is butt i thoughtbecause    i was soo young when i first saw this movie that i just didnt understand  what was going on but 8 years later i still think this movie is hella butt just a waste i dont understand how people thought this movie was soo scarry
May 2 2010,negative,what i liked its was the first of its kind    what i didnt i never thought this movie was that good even when it came out     would i recommend it i dont really understand what people see in this movie you can get more scares walking through the woods at night in real life not a movie i would recommend
May 2 2010,positive,a fake version of the real footage
May 2 2010,positive,it was good  the ending was dissappointing but other than that it was pretty good i wouldnt go as far as to say it was particularly scary but during the night scenes you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat just waiting for morning to come
Apr 28 2010,positive,i was actually sold on the idea that shit really happenedknowing that you can understand how scary i found this to be on my first pass
Apr 28 2010,positive,very original and unique movie that contains an amazing buildup and gives the viewer the opportunity to imagine what their seeing as oppose to showing graphic images and giving the plot away the ending leaves the viewer to ponder what might of happened to them and if they were ever found
Apr 27 2010,negative,this was a stupid boring horror movie i hate it when movies dont explain what actually happens in them
Apr 24 2010,positive,love it it freaked me out 
Apr 22 2010,positive,it created a style of filmmaker it was the first movie to use the internet to create a viral campaign like it or not its groundbreaking
Apr 22 2010,positive,original and uniquethe blair witch project will be spooky to some viewersbut on the other hand some viewers will find it very unspookyyou are either a 100 fan or a 100 hater    this film is about 3 young adultsprobably in there 20s that hike into a forest to film a documentary about a legend that is local in the areaand that local is known as the blair witchthey were never heard from again after filming this documentarynone of them made it home    their footage was found a year laternow everyone can see what happend to them    on a good note  i just recently watched this movie for the 2nd time nowand im suprised that i see it differenlty than i did when i first watched itit actually has a fear bit of well done suspenseeffective horror scenes and is intesely freaky
Apr 18 2010,positive,unique intelligent compelling the blair witch project is a experience that although lives up to its reputation doesnt provide too many terrifying sequences the scenario and how it is portrayed is terrifying but the actual content itself isnt
Apr 17 2010,positive,the blair witch project    in october of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentarya year later their footage was found    the blair witch project is the shocking horror movie that scared cinema audience members worldwide    it follows the very simple story of three students that go into the woods in a town called burkittsville to film a documentary on the legend of the blair witch at the start everything seems well for the three students until they realise they are being followed by the sinister being that is the blair witch    the blair witch project must be the most terrifying horror film that was released in 1999 and is arguably the most frightening film released in the 1990s the acting performances by heather donahue joshua leonard and michael c williams are breathtaking and petrifying and considering the films script was completely improvised their acting was incredibly believable the films cinematography was different but this wasnt a bad thing using a common handicam to film the events that were happening added to the overall tension and suspence that was being slowly built up what makes the blair witch project even more frightening is the fact that the viewer never actually gets to see the witch although descriptions of what she looks like are given allowing them to create an image in their head amazingly this film only had a budget between 500000 and 750000 and considering this incredibly low budget directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez still managed to make a horror film so terrifying it was actually believable    in conclusion the blair witch project is a truly petrifying horror movie that is certainly a modern classic and will undoubtedly be counted as a classic for generations to come    fear factor 55  gore score 25  movie rating 910  overall 1620    words by daniel sheppard
Apr 16 2010,negative,i greatly appreciate the idea that fear is best invoked by the most basic means such as the sound of footsteps in the dark or cries of distant but distinctly human voices    however this great idea founders on so many technical aspects of this movie that it virtually prevents blair witch from creating any real impact on the audience    i the forest  the setting is completely inappropriate the forest here is by no means dense with no cliffs with no wild rivers or steep slopes granted the moreorless uniform terrain gives an excuse for getting lost as it clearly does not provide many reference points for orientation but throughout the entire film i kept wondering how it is possible that three people equipped with a map and a compass cannot find a way back since i am not willing accept the very first premise i cannot possibly move on with the plot    ii the characters  it is hard to build some kind of affection towards two idiots led by a lunatic during the first half of the movie i was toying with the idea that all three of them would kill each other i would almost certainly kill heather after a day of her relentless i know exactly where we are     iii the camera  blair witch  the camera in hands of the characters is the key point of the films architecture but it also creates a major flaw an omnipresent camera could not be used here for several reasons a it would create more objective and consequently more distant picture of the situation revealing its full absurdity totally alienating the audience from the protagonists b it would have to reveal the blair witch or at least give some clearer idea about her or it if you like which would destroy the concept fear of the unknown c with the budget of 30000 dollars handheld camera is probably a more viable option however the handheld camera comes with some problematic implications for example why would anyone enter a scary house holding a camera instead of a weapon
Apr 12 2010,positive,now keep in mind that when i went to see this on opening nighti was thinking it was realso as me and a sold out theater watchedwe were scaredlolit was just crazy and shocked and at the end the audiance was very quiet and we were all in shock let me tell ya i think we felt soooo much better when we found out it was fakewhooooo hoooogreat flick
Apr 9 2010,negative,i regret going to the movies to see this
Apr 8 2010,negative,less attractive and not nearly as interesting as a turd avoid
Apr 8 2010,negative,man i can make a better version of this oh wait i did in 7th grade check it 
Apr 5 2010,positive,classic original and inapiration  for indie filmakers
Apr 5 2010,positive,keeps you hooked but its not scary at all im glad i just rented it and didnt buy it
Apr 5 2010,positive,could have been better
Apr 5 2010,positive,i thought it was ok but was expecting much more because of all the positive reviews haveing said that the ending scared the shit out of me
Apr 3 2010,positive,deserving of its title as the forefather of the found footage genre it builds its tension slowly and continually while never failing to also advance its plot
Apr 2 2010,neutral,good concept bad shooting made me dizzy and no joke puke
Apr 2 2010,negative,so not scary completely over rated
Apr 1 2010,positive,low budget and works
Mar 31 2010,negative,such an over rated piece of garbage the camera work sucked balls the story line was blah cool idea but didnt work for me
Mar 30 2010,negative,this movie straight out sucks i was waiting for it to get scary but it never did it wasnt scary as hell it was boring as hell and it ended terrible this is a very stupid movie its an hour and 27 min of boring home video footage
Mar 29 2010,positive,without a doubt  since its release theres something called before and after the bwp
Mar 29 2010,positive,much like paranormal activity it is not the scariest movie ever made however it is very effective in being a freaky movie and paranormal activity owes very much to this movie for everything that it does well as you can probably tell i liked paranormal activity and i was very scared after i finished watching it i was not as terrified at the end of blair witch but i was very freaked out the actors are very genuine and convincing and the final scene is quite terrifying    im gonna make another reference to pa like with pa i think people said this movie sucked because they didnt find it as scary as they thought it would be however you cant deny that this movie gets under your skin    after youve seen pa or maybe before you watch it watch the movie that paved the way for such a successful movie
Mar 29 2010,positive,thats the outsider that beats most of the hollywoods scary movies its on my top 5 scary movies of all times the mockumentary is great the marketing of the film is legendary the 1st time i saw it on a theater i had chills in all my body even now its difficult for me to watch it alone at night i understand thought why so many people didnt like it it was something new and experimental its shows nothing and has a fast ending well i think everytime something new an unusual appears most of peopleespecially those who cant understand itwill criticise it negatively its something we can see through human history its human nature that way  for me the things that didnt show us are most terryfing than any cgi monster or makeup the source of every human fear is the fear of unknown and thats exactly what this film takes advantage the terror comes from the mindfrom the things that you cant see but you can perceive it from the reactions of the characters from the noises from the background story and from the woods think about that the next time youll enter a gloomy forest
Mar 28 2010,negative,the ending might weird you out on the first viewing but any repeat viewings will bore you to tears hugely overrated tedious horror
Mar 26 2010,negative,film about a bunch of ass holes who dont realise each other are ass holes until they get into the woods none of them know how to use a map or compass and they all think that standing around bickering will help them get home quicker even everlasting camera batteries isnt going to keep these guys happy oh and there was this witch  or was there i ask not to sound dramatic but because i didnt see it instead i wasted my time watching this film to see people bickering right the way through    not fun there were some dramatic scenes with plenty of jump opportunities but none were taken    a lot has been achieved on a small budget but this could have and certainly should have been so much better
Mar 24 2010,positive,the best horror truly is the stuff that feels real blair witch uses the mockdoc style to great effect it also illustrates human nature in scary situations
Mar 23 2010,positive,definitely original and suspenseful this film was pretty good but i expected more from it
Mar 23 2010,negative,oh nausea how i love you p
Mar 22 2010,positive,when i watched blair witch i couldnt even get to the wc to have a pee i was so damn scared as the first scene of jaws has permanently wrecked every sea swim legs kicking in the quiet water ddderr nu derrr nu dum um dum dum so my days of happy camping have also come to a close cos when i watched blair witch i was off every weekend into the woods and woods are all the same when youre lostthat noise outside the tent of rock against rock ive heard it that sound and the twig snapping which is definitely not an animal i know itand those twatty studentsi know them all toospecially the one who threw away the map  umm this ones like your glass of rhum and coke when you realise from the after taste that someone just spiked it
Mar 21 2010,negative,this entire movie was about 3 kids getting lost in the woods none of them can read a map let alone have any common sense about anything nothing was scary about this movie
Mar 21 2010,positive,unbelivieablly scary and haunting
Mar 20 2010,negative,omg what a piece of crap this was
Mar 20 2010,negative,i think it was the movie itself that made people barf in the theaters when this one came out not the jiggling camera work which spoiled it for me pretty poorly made
Mar 20 2010,positive,very scary to watch but great with acting like a documentary
Mar 18 2010,neutral,you either like it or you hate it
Mar 17 2010,positive,the first and most twisted of the carrying the camera along with the action movies when i first saw it it pulled me in a bit but the ending was a uhh dang     now copied by cloverfeild and paranormal activity for the low budget look im filming my own movie
Mar 16 2010,negative,you know this movie gave me the creeps it deterred me from going into the woods alone at night for awhile you could say that it succeeded in that sense
Mar 16 2010,negative,boring not even scary lol 
Mar 16 2010,positive,best horror movie ever made hands down also joshua leonard
Mar 15 2010,positive,okay so the horror genre had gone through a lot of different phases over the years weve had the classic monster movies films about horrors of fire horrors of water movies about demonic possession dimeadozen slasher films psychological thrillers and the occasional horrorcomedy we always know theres a fantasy element to most of these movies its escapism and we know its not real but now we touch upon a film that wants you to believe that it is real    one of the most hyped and ingeniously marketed films of alltime the blair witch project presents a new found footage genre where three film students set out into the woods of burkittsville maryland to produce a documentary about the fabled blair witch what drew so many people in was that the filmmakers advertised the movie like it was a real event like real people had actually gone off into the woods and this is what happened to them the movies official website listed these people as missing even to this day i think some people still believe this was a real thing that happened how does that work    well we have heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard begin their filming by interviewing locals about the supposed legend of the blair witch one mentions a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods where he tortured and murdered them he pled insanity saying that the spirit of an 18th century witch forced him to do it naturally this is all film gold to them as they wander out into the woods stopping near coffin rock where five men in the 19th century were found ritualistically murdered they set up camp but the deeper they go into the woods the more tense the atmosphere around them becomes and the more onedge they become    i have to admit when i first saw this movie i didnt think it was anything special sure its a cool concept and theres plenty of mystery but i didnt think the characters were likeable and it got just a little tiresome and confusing after a while but after giving it a second watch the blair witch project has a lot going for it what i like is the gradual transition of these characters they start out lighthearted excited slightly arrogant but mostly fun people ive made student films before so i enjoyed seeing them get so into the filmmaking aspect of this but as time goes on and they get more and more lost their nerves and emotions start taking hold of them and its all they can do to keep from screaming at each other all the time and you know what it works we start out enjoying whats happening because thats what theyre doing and as they become more stressed and scared so do we and for all the faults these people have we can still identify with and understand what theyre doing theres always someone that wants to be a leader someone who will lose patience quicker than the others and someone who will do a lot of complaining this doesnt make them bad people theyre just caught up in a horrible situation the only thing that seemed really off is when we find out what mike does with the map it didnt seem believable to me even within the films logic    of course i should also talk about the scares during the night we hear strange soft noises from outside the tent the fear lies in the mystery throughout most of the movie were peering out into the dark wondering what could be out there its quite effective at times most of the time were afraid of a strange noise itself rather than what could have made it for me i think the creepiest moment is when heather discovers bloody remains of one of her friends after one of them goes missing because were teased with the possibility of something but we dont know what actually happened or how    the movie isnt always engaging though while i mentioned like the transition of the characters i dont feel the same way about the horror aspect what i mean is i feel like it should slowly build each scary scene on top of the next until it unleashes a hellish climax it seems to start that way but i thought one or two of the really scary moments were played too soon and the ending im still really uncertain about it i get what they were going for and how it relates to the legend but im confused to how it was set up is heather supposed to be holding the camera at this moment because her screams sound really far away and it just doesnt feel as frantic as it should im left more confused when the credits roll than anything    but i admire this movie for its authenticity and attention to detail the filmmakers put the actors through hell just like the characters when they end up in a certain part of the woods the reactions are real they didnt know where they were going to end up they even believed that the blair witch was a real legend and were given less food each day of shooting to make them more edgy during the scene where theyre in the tent and the tent starts shaking violently that was the director shaking it which actually scared them    the blair witch project was a milestone for independent filmmaking it was made on a shoestring budget and grossed almost 250 million which still outstrips all other found footage films is it a masterpiece well it is for the most part but i still feel like it could have been slightly better but its certainly effective it puts you into that mood of being stuck in the middle of nowhere your nerves constantly on the lookout ive never gone camping before and seeing this movie didnt change that i personally prefer another found footage film for reasons that ill explain in a few days but this movie is still a fascinating journey it features one of the most chilling scenes in any horror movie heathers apology to the camera near the end it scared a lot of people and it was a groundbreaking piece of cinema
Mar 15 2010,positive,still the scariest movie ive ever seen
Mar 14 2010,positive,good movie better than blair witch 2 or the cheap ripoff paranormal activity  if you havent seen it worth a watch
Mar 13 2010,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen definitely could have been given a better budjet and maybe then it would have been better just maybe
Mar 12 2010,positive,true it doesnt have much of a story and its characters are weak and unsympathetic but its full of creepy campfire scares mockdoc the blair witch project keeps audiences in the dark about its titular villain  thus proving that imagination can be as scary as anything onscreen
Mar 11 2010,positive,now its not scary at all no music so it wasnt scary i know that it was a documentary but i still liked it it was fun watch and i bought it both dvd   and vhs  of it i will get it on bluray when it comes out too
Mar 11 2010,negative,i really dont know if it even deserves that much when i first watched it at 14 i nearly fell asleep in the movie theatre if it comes across as that inane to someone barely experiencing puberty its pretty damn stupid if you ask me
Mar 10 2010,positive,scared the shit out of me when it came out good horror thriller
Mar 9 2010,negative,stoopid like paranormal activity
Mar 9 2010,positive,id never even heard of the blair witch project before i saw it so in my defence i was 14 i believed it was real needless to say i was terrified of the dark that night
Mar 9 2010,positive,a great movie not scary though if they added music it might of been scary
Mar 8 2010,neutral,ground breaking in 1999 but doesnt hold it certainly wasnt as suspenseful as the ads at the time lead to believe
Mar 8 2010,positive,this movie is amazingthe blair witch project is the first of its kind and its fast and fun and the most inportant thing its scarythis film unlike paranormal activity this film is actully scary and realevery one is real and notthing is fakethe scenes were the teens are freaking out is perfect and i think that the ending was amazingsee it
Mar 8 2010,negative,i really respect someone that can make a film such as this on next to no budget and make loads of money i didnt really enjoy it it was a pretty cool idea theres not much happening to fill out an hour and a half worth of film
Mar 8 2010,positive,scared the crap outa me
Mar 8 2010,negative,stay clear of this as much as you can after so many years i finally watched it with very low expectations and it delivered just that not worthy of being shown in movie theatres hope this will not become the standard for movie making people that cant read a map then start wining about it a whole movie long is not my idea of an entertainingmovie evening s
Mar 7 2010,positive,okay it has been overblown somewhat and it is far from scary  but it must be lauded for the naturalness of the three leads and what was achieved on such a small budget i did wish that i didnt have to wait nearly 90 minutes for heather donahue to top whining though
Mar 7 2010,negative,the kind of movie that generated a hype  but you never want to see it again
Mar 6 2010,positive,creepy when you watch it by yourself in the dark for the first time
Mar 6 2010,neutral,i thought this movie was kinda confusing and i really didnt like it
Mar 5 2010,positive,three film students set out into the black hills forest to make a documentary on the legendary blair witch armed with a 16mm camera a hi8 video camera and a dat recorder every step word and sound is captured after wandering around the black hills forest heather josh and mike are cold lost and hunted finally one night after the last ray of light had left the forest black they were never to be seen again despite thousands of hours searching the black hills area neither of the filmmakers or any trace of their gear was found and the search was called off one year later a bag full of film cans dat tapes and video tapes were found the behind the scenes video footage and the film are cut together to make a fictional movie which seems more than real    this movie scared the hell out of me man one of the most extremely scariest and creepiest movie i have ever seen extremely real better than paranormal activity man very chilling very thrilling movie made me stick to the screen superb the ending of the movie was just awsome its a documentary style well the actors were good the night scenes scared me you never see anything but still makes you shake your boots lol i loved it
Mar 5 2010,neutral,after all it is not a bad film there are these three guys who fight after few days of life in common more or less is like a reality show it would be lovely if all the reality shows finish with the death of their characters on the contrary for the three guys in the movie i feel sympathy specially for the girl so we were like this in the end of the nineties dressed with flannel shirts and with long grunge hair or beard i wasnt really frightened by the blair witch tony blair is 10 times more dangerous
Mar 4 2010,positive,people who didnt see this back in the day with all the hype just wont get it
Mar 2 2010,positive,this one isnt for everyone i like it because its original
Feb 26 2010,positive,this movie is incredible from start to finish it draws you to it it does an spectacular job of setting the documentary idea the acting is great sos the concept and the absence of music makes it even more worthwhile and scary    i can see why this movie received so much credit my family regards it as being overrated but i see that theyve overlooked it    on the dvd the curse of the blair witch elaborates the story and makes the movie even eerier the curse does a good job of impersonating a real documentary that happened and it is kind of a double negative joke it is a new breed of horror from masterminds who created a scary and thrilling story    i can see why people thought that this was true and it is extremely lifelike this is one of the best horror films ever and that is a stretch because halloween used to be the highest grossing independent film ever but now this is    i hope forward to seeing blair witch 3    all horror fans have to see this 100
Feb 25 2010,positive,doesnot scare me but at the right end when they be at the house there when begin to scare me  i wish it was real  good movie
Feb 25 2010,positive,when i saw this movie in the theater i froze at the end i was then brought back to reality by the sound of half of the audience laughing and the others puking or running to the restrooms to hurl that last scene blew me away
Feb 24 2010,positive,enjoyed it not sure its one you could view again  again tho
Feb 23 2010,positive,a new breed of horror is introuduced in this film and it is very hard to duplicate the movie is pretty scary throughout but the ending is most memorable there is no gore but the suspense is top notch the acting is convincing enough to keep your attention and it feels like your there with the characters
Feb 23 2010,positive,when i saw this movie in the theater i froze at the end i was then brought back to reality by the sound of half of the audience laughing and the others puking or running to the restrooms to hurl that last scene blew me away
Feb 23 2010,negative,didnt think this was scarry at all and was a poor excuse for a movie lame
Feb 23 2010,neutral,the way it was filmed made me motion sick
Feb 23 2010,positive,epic the movie premiere was also epic
Feb 22 2010,negative,didnt like the movie at all  great movie if you like seeing the camera shuffling and cant concentrate on anything i really disliked it
Feb 19 2010,positive,another one of the scariest movies ive ever seen
Feb 19 2010,positive,whole movie was bit scary ending was amazing very very similar to paranormal activities 
Feb 19 2010,positive,ok i had heard that the blair witch project was although not gory still very scary i had only seen parts of it and thought it was kinda scary but then paranormal activity came out and reviews claimed  scariest movie since the blair witch project and scarier than the blair witch project i saw paranormal activity which was relatively scary but back on topici was reluctant to watch the blair witch project i watched it last night and during the film itself it was scary but not like frightening but when the movie ended and i thought about it it becomes so much scarier you may hear this movie is stupid or you never see the killer or theres no blood 2 out of those 3 comments were true but this movie is not stupid made on a shoestring budget it managed to scare me more than any recent big budget thrillers and thats what i was looking for
Feb 19 2010,positive,weird like paranormal activity except better
Feb 17 2010,positive,i watched couple documentaries and they explained how in bw 1 only true thing is about serial killer in that house but bw 2 is based on true storywhere some guy take those people and kill them all
Feb 16 2010,positive,a key point was spoiled for me a long time ago so the ending the part that i didnt know about was the only really compelling part and jeez the characters swear a lot
Feb 16 2010,positive,i dont watch horror movies but this one was an exception the movie was very scary and impressive for the unique filming
Feb 15 2010,positive,first horror film that actually scared me

Feb 12 2010,positive,as fake as it is it is still guaranteed to freak you out first viewing  teen years
Feb 12 2010,positive,loved the movie would have liked a bit more closure at the end
Feb 11 2010,positive,early version of paranormal activity this film started a great turn for mystery documentaries worth the watch    ty
Feb 10 2010,negative,terrible film documentary is much better
Feb 9 2010,negative,i watched this movie by myself in a dark room i found this movie boring i couldnt see how or why anybody could be scared by itnot one moment did i jump or move from my seat this movie lacks the horror element and tops the cake with bad acting
Feb 8 2010,positive,i thought this was a great scary flick i just wish they didnt use the fbomb every 5 seconds     this was just a mental mind scary movie  no gore to shock you
Feb 8 2010,positive,with the recent release of paranormal activity it seems only fair that i write this review now in this review i have seen paranormal activity before this one so you can judge me all you want but my view is that this is inferior to paranormal activity now that is not saying this is a bad film i understand that this was the original and i really liked the style it wasnt too ridiculous and the acting i actually liked a lot better than paranormal that being said this movie comes up short on scares and freak out level it seems as if everything is forced and some of the events that happened arent too scary at all the blair witch project comes up short on scares and it can be a bit annoying at times but the acting is very good and it is definitely going to make you shift in your seat from the uneasiness it creates    you can judge me all you want for having seen pa first but blair witch just did not scare me or invade my imagination at all but it did make me very uncomfortable the direction is pretty cool with many scenes in complete darkness with only the audio to save you from the creepy sounds and actions happening some scenes are staged nicely but there isnt the big payoff that you have with pa it rises its gets creepy it gets uncomfortable and the pay off is weaker than it should have been the ending is actually quite well done and leaves much to the viewer to extract but it didnt chill me like pa nor did it make me scream out loud which i hardly ever do like pa either pa is simply a better movie but this is some decent filmmaking and bound to scare many others    what i commend the movie for is being better in the acting department than in pa pa had two actors who were alright in their roles for being called by an ad in a paper blair witch has some solid acting and the construction of the characters from the beginning is pretty meat and is has a more home movie look than pa these characters are funny stupid teenagers trying to make a documentary and things start going wrong and yes they make some very poor decisions but those stereotypical horror movie choices are flushed out by true panic and mental breakdowns its a cut above what you would think and i was very satisfied with how the movie progressed    all in all no two people will ever be scared by the same thing obviously if you are looking to be scared you have a better chance of being scared than someone who does not want to be scared and think they are impenetrable i usually let myself go for these type of movies and pa scared the living piss out of me and blair witch simply did not but the filmmaking i found more home video like which i admired the acting is much better than pa and the film is well paced i think i admire this more for being a good movie and a really haunting one the blair witch project may not scare you or give you that massive payoff you were hoping for but its some damn fine filmmaking on a budget of 60 000    rent it
Feb 7 2010,positive,i hear people rip on this movie all the time why like all good movies there is a certain atmosphere and location that blair witch must be viewed in and for clarification paranormal activity is a huge ripoff of this movie blair witch is more well done this is why pa is not bad eitherits just not an original idea    blair witch project upon first viewing reminds me immediately of alfred hitchcock the fear comes from what is not seen the tension building as we try to figure out what may or may not be therethe beginning is lighthearted enough chronicling the start of the making of this documentary by three college students they interview people film themselves and get a little important background on the blair witch a slow start but all important nonetheless    things start to pick up once they reach the woods heather josh and mikey slowly become more and more irritable as time and weather wear on them as they note key locations and events regarding the blair witch things continue to go south as they hear noises see things hear things notice thingstheir panic is palpable and powerful as if youre right in their tiny tent with them until josh disappears then the shit hits the fan    the music and the atmosphere really draw you into the film creepy foreboding sinister and hidden looming in the background quietly and eerily there is not blood in this movie but there does not need to be the fear grows by leaps and bounds and the climax is well let us just say that you probably wont have a good sleep that night    blair witch is a true horror film nothing startles you like most horror slasher filmsthe tension grows and grows and grows like hands slowly clasping around you neck never once letting off any pressure until the climax which makes that climax ever the more scary and spinetingling suspenseful eerie and mesmerizing blair witch project does horror the right way and stands as one of my favorite movies of alltime never mind of one the best suspensehorror flicks of alltime too why are we afraid of the dark because we fear that which we cannot see    sweet dreams
Feb 7 2010,negative,very overrated and not even slightly scary
Feb 6 2010,positive,this movie had me curled into a ball on my couch by the end no other movie has mentally terrified me as much as this one when i saw it
Feb 6 2010,negative,very dull good tecnique with the camera work but it makes you feel dizzy after a while the fact we dont see the witch makes it boring rather than having a greater impact
Feb 6 2010,negative,a movie about the three dumbest people who just get dumber and dumber as the movie goes on
Feb 6 2010,neutral,its scary at the end lol d
Feb 6 2010,negative,scary no way boring and dull of course i honestly did not find the ending impressive or appealing all i can say is the actors and actresses did all right
Feb 4 2010,positive,its great but kind of freaky
Feb 3 2010,positive,intriguing with an excellent conclusion that beats anything that came before it the film is proof you dont need a million dollars for a good concept its a shame the film didnt create alot more fear made on a shoe string this film works but the acting and script writing is the major let down here  the lower quality film works to the films benefit creating the first film of its type in the process hollywood would eventually follow suit
Feb 3 2010,positive,everyone seems to hate this movie and i dont know why i always thought it was one of the best horror movies ever made and still to this day is one of my favorite movies
Feb 2 2010,positive,this movie rocked the film though lower quality just added effefct to how fucking scary this movie was the plot was fantastic and i thought the actors were perfect the only bad thing is that i know that this is fake it says it right at the end i still wouldnt be sleeping well if this story was 100 true i thought the scenes were so well put together and i swear to god if i ever find my tent sahking i am running for my life until i find a road the only bad thing about this movie is how long it took to get freaky the very beginning was only freaky because you could see what was going to happen
Feb 2 2010,positive,look for whatever reason this film just works works maybe its the brilliantly simplistic execution and the acknowledgement of our fear of the dark regardless the film works wonders with its well drawn out concept the performances from the three actors who used their actual names for their roles deliver truly dramatically effective performances the film has been penalized for not being real after people found out about it but honestly how anyone could think it was real is beyond me why would you think their families would condone to show footage of them being terrorized and seemingly murdered on the big secret is just plain ridiculous however its with that state of mind that the film is truly effective and even though i knew that it was fake you cant help but doubt the knowledge you have because it just all feels so damn well although it doesnt hold as well up over time due to the various rip offs blair witch still remains a truly disturbing and powerful genre entry
Feb 1 2010,positive,it took a fair amount of time before the suspense actually kicked in
Jan 31 2010,positive,i saw this movie once right when it came out and thought it was amazing but will never watch it again as i am still afraid to go down a basement staircase because of this film nice work lowbudget scariness
Jan 31 2010,positive,suspenseful and groundbreaking the style works masterfully even if the ending leaves you hanging
Jan 31 2010,negative,3rd time round and still a bit disappointing   great concept and some of the interviews with the locals sets the scene well but a bit too slow and lame ending spoiled it
Jan 31 2010,neutral,seeing as which this movie was praised for using such a cheap cam recorder i wasnt really impressed i like it that they never revealed the blair witch i just dont get it how people could be so terrified watching this film
Jan 29 2010,negative,this was a good horror film i may be one of the few people to admit this but i would say many would agree with me garbage
Jan 27 2010,negative,this is an hour and a half that i will never get back i am lesser a person for having viewed this movie

Jan 27 2010,positive,it got me even if it is fake its one of the best works of art ive ever seen
Jan 26 2010,positive,sometimes its the most simple effects that are the most effective effects thats the case with the blair witch project
Jan 25 2010,positive,this movie makes you dizzy i saw this movie when i was 16 and it scared me half to death but the f word is used more than any other wordthey did a good job of making it look like a home movie

Jan 23 2010,negative,when this came out in theaters i snuck in and still felt ripped off
Jan 21 2010,positive,an edgy terrifying horror that proves you dont need special effects to produce scares the suffocating atmosphere chills you to the bone
Jan 21 2010,positive,keeps u hanged on if u willing in to watch can seem like a drag but once captivated can really make a person hang on to this one
Jan 20 2010,negative,the blair witch project 1999 is really not that a good film its was boring  shit while it had good use of the style of the camera even though it was outdated was like a homemovie gone wrong which i like movie that a filmed like homemovie but this is the worst kind of them  was a really pointless movie of the 90s i really cant believe that i was eight and was shit scared of this stupid film    the film did have some cheap scary  really unsettling moments in this weirdo movie  it had its far share of creepiness but these all mostly happened at the end of the movie which thank god it was a long movie but it was a shit spooky film and was bad for its genre horror mystery  thriller which is a huge disappointment on the genre because i love these sort of type genre  this film really did ruined it while the only bit of the film that truly scared me was the ending as the acting  story really made me believe while also the voice  sound effect in the film really did give me goosebumps  was really eerie but those scenes were only the good parts of the movie which the rest were utley crap       this film is also in my favourite book as i use like my bible i bloody love it called 101 horror movie you must see before you die which the blair witch project is in in the section of the 90s movies which personally i dont agree with which i would of when i was eight but now i really dont and i know it every people of view but i would find another great 90s horror movie to see before you die as i really do wish i didnt see this film now but i can say i thought it was totally rubbish
Jan 19 2010,positive,good way a keeping ya thriller but other then that pretty gay
Jan 18 2010,negative,the movie was sooo boring waited for something good to happen but nothing did and the ending sucked
Jan 18 2010,positive,hungrycold and haunted
Jan 17 2010,negative,this was so stupid nothing ever happened it was so boring do not see it
Jan 17 2010,positive,i threw it in the river funnest line ever
Jan 17 2010,positive,i love this movieit is very eerie and entertaining
Jan 17 2010,negative,i have no idea why it got as great of a review as it did for one i found this movie very boring and not scary at all the only thing good about this movie was its ending
Jan 17 2010,positive,creeped me out at the time of release
Jan 16 2010,negative,i effing hated this movie plus it made me want to vomit from motion sickness
Jan 16 2010,negative,two words steadicam  or does that count as one
Jan 16 2010,negative,rubbish all that hype for a very dull movie and crap camera work i didnt like it much at all
Jan 15 2010,negative,great acting but not very scary
Jan 15 2010,negative,amatur film but an interesting concept of dealing with the idea of fear
Jan 14 2010,positive,the blair witch is a film were you dont watch it for entertainment mabye for some peopleyou have to put yourself in the characters shoes then when you think about it its a terrifying film
Jan 14 2010,positive,i know a lot of people dont like this movie but i thought it was fantastic for a mockdoc this is filmed extremely well and the ambiance and atmosphere was on point
Jan 13 2010,positive,the last minutes are the scariest
Jan 13 2010,positive,i want to avoid being cheesy here i want to avoid any cheese heather donahue    horror films of the 90s saw the supposed end of freddy krueger and jason voorhees vampires in a strip club a giant anaconda hannibal the cannibal chucky with his wife pennywise the clown a mocking of the slasher genre and a little independent film about 3 college students the blair witch project was one of the first films to incorporate the idea of a documentary horror film where the events are meant to be perceived to the audience as real i have seen this film numerous times and i have to say that it remains an ok film its not without its problems but the fact that it does so many innovative and effective things outweighs its problems    the film follows the supposed real footage of 3 students in 1994 seeking to find the mythic blair witch in maryland and at the same time make a documentary for the public about this witch they take a 2 day hike in the woods and we know from the beginning that somehow they eventually found themselves missing and without their camera the weakness i can see people having major dislike for is the lack of any major events nothing really happens until the very end and quite frankly its really boring at times there are times where it tries to make a great attempt at horror but for the majority of the film we just have the main characters talking to each other about the problems theyre going through for me this sort of thing works because i can appreciate the lack of events due to the large amount of suspense one thing i incredibly love about the film is the lack of the blair witch itself id be lying if i said i didnt want to know what it looked like but the film does a great job about building up the tension of it it seems to follow what 1979s alien did by not showing the monstervillain for most of the film it knows that youre imagination will fill in the rest and that its more likely to scare you that way though theres been much speculation as to what it looks like and ill admit id like to see one glimpse of it the lack of any creature really shows that its trying to take the audience seriously however there has been no official image of it released that means that even if you look it up you dont know what it is that theyre looking for the camera work further cements the the good horror aspect of the film its quite disturbing to think of this as real footage because of just how awful the events are for the characters    the thing about the blair witch project is that besides the horror aspect and the camera work theres very little to talk about it its one of those films that quite simply youre either going to get it or not      andrews rating75 out of 10
Jan 12 2010,negative,lousy hokey horrible
Jan 12 2010,positive,genius everything a horror movie should be its scary because it is seemingly real
Jan 11 2010,negative,this was one of the absolute worst movies i ever saw  i cant believe anyone would give it a high rating  of course you dont need to see anything to get scared but the whole time it felt like i was waiting for some sort of peak in the plot and nothing happened  the whole movie was flat and boring  the movie felt like a really terrible and excruciatingly boring horror story that is told once around the fire at camp and everyone is begging for it to stop halfway through  thats how boring it was
Jan 11 2010,neutral,i expected much more x
Jan 11 2010,positive,a great movie to watch before a campout  i was very glad it was not longer
Jan 11 2010,positive,sometimes you dont need to see stuff to get scared it was a different type of presentation not sure if this was inpired by any other film but it was a nice experience the website of this film adds to the makebelieve stuff too
Jan 11 2010,positive,sometimes you dont need to see stuff to get scared it was a different type of presentation not sure if this was inpired by any other film but it was a nice experience the website of this film adds to the makebelieve stuff too
Jan 11 2010,negative,there are few films out there that have bored me quite as much as this one people running about with camcorders being stupid for 2 hours is not dramatic its just dull brainbreakingly dull    dont get me wrong im a fan of films that are so bad theyre entertaining but this film has absolutely nothing going for it
Jan 10 2010,positive,a really good movie in its heyday
Jan 10 2010,positive,what can i say i liked this    it was one of the first films to be filmed in first person there were no scary stuff caught on camera or gory scenesbut the story itself felt realistic enough to enjoy it and well entertainedthis is not a true story as the actors are all alive and well    this and cloverfield is one of the best first person camera movies out thereas well as vhs are really good to watch and be entertained    they gave the actors messages in milk carts to tell them where they should go in this filmsso they were really out camping and didnt expect what was coming next made the film quite unique b
Jan 10 2010,positive,so scary because its true
Jan 9 2010,positive,very unique at its time  surely scared me then
Jan 9 2010,positive,the movie that inspired the camera style where the actors are filming a film low on budget but high on thrills
Jan 9 2010,positive,this film was good but not great it had some intense scenes but none that were scary but i loved how it was set out to be a documentary
Jan 8 2010,negative,awful horrible ending
Jan 8 2010,positive,i liked the movie i actually enjoyed the hype more people wondering if it was real the viral marketing etc  its a long road to the payoff but it did give me chills
Jan 6 2010,positive,very scary do not wash before a camp cause i did and i could barely sleep the scariest scene is the final one i give it 78 only venom goes to the town scene which i did not like
Jan 5 2010,negative,too much shaky camera movements and nothing much happened to spook me  and essentially a film about kids arguing and falling out in the woods no reason to watch this
Jan 4 2010,positive,the best found footage movie ive seen and while its not too scary its realistic and seems very possible a good movie to creep you out of going into the woods
Jan 4 2010,positive,wow just wow that was perhaps the most kick ass movie for the horror genre ever not only does it suck you in with its dark and chilling atmosphere but if you watch in the dark youll really sht your pants with this one the acting is superb i mean i thought this thing was real didnt read the wiki page properly its shot in doucmentary style i mean theythey just looked so godamn convincing especially when they freaked out that was cool they did everything properly introducing the blair witch not just going for a walk and in the cliche going oh by the way there was a witch omg nope they do it right but there was just one thing keeping me from giving it a 100 the college kids stupidity namely they brought nothing but junk food on a several day hike and two didnt even think to use the godamn sun to walk back to the city seriously comuntiy college right the ending was the best though i mean i wontt spoil it but blairay scares the shit out of them and meay just awesome my recomendation buy it now 4 and half crazy rednecks out of five
Jan 4 2010,positive,a cult movie you have to let yourself be scared but its a classic
Jan 3 2010,negative,stupidest movie of our times
Jan 2 2010,positive,this movie scared the shit out of meh at first now its one of me favorites
Jan 2 2010,negative,went to the movies watched half of this then puked in the lobby  motion sickness strikes again
Jan 1 2010,positive,the most explosive horror film of the past 20 years quietly terrifying and intense the blair witch project totally scares not because of stunning special effects or make up but because of its shaky handheld cinematography that doesnt let you see it all the film goes straight to your head and plants horrifying ideas that stick to you like leeches and oh that nightmare ending
Jan 1 2010,negative,quite possibly one of the worst films ive subjected myself to for all the hype i was sorely let down whats pawned off as a supernatural thriller left nothing more than a desire for dramamine and a refund over an hour of screaming whining and crying my 1 year old son is more entertaining when he needs a diaper change and would result in a better film as he tries to wiggle away  it saddens me that paranormal activity is being compared to this
Jan 1 2010,positive,this is one of those rare movies that can actually bring you to that place of childlike fear the ending is perfection
Jan 1 2010,negative,i could say a lot of hateful things about this movie but i wont it had some spooky moments and couldve been better
Jan 1 2010,negative,just kept waiting for it to get scary  way to much hype for nothing but a poor home movie
Dec 31 2009,positive,10 years on and this film can still produce a few scares the reason for its success is simple a genuinely great premise well conceived good performances and you dont get to see what the evil actually looks like it is like a long messedup version of a twilight zone episode in a lot of ways the idea that you get lost in the woods and can never find your way back out still genuinely disturbing if you have enough imagination not to need a big cgi monster to provide the scares for you
Dec 31 2009,negative,this one  just sucks its not scary nd it hasnt a good story neither so
Dec 30 2009,positive,the blair witch project was one of those rare very rare movies where i didnt know it existed until a friend rented it and came home to find me and some people hanging out there he comes in and tells us that hes got a boot leg version of some movie thats about to come out sometime soon and that he scored this rare footage that was all true and uncut from which the real movie that hadnt supposedly been released yet was going to be made from get it so were all like ok lets see this live footage that you have and so as we all watched this as a group we were all duped into believing that it actually happened until towards the end of the story i started seeing some loose ends unravel and yelled out it was all a scam that was a fun prank a while back 
Dec 28 2009,positive,the blair witch project not only is a creepy horror film it has very witty humor at the beginning but very good movie very scary film this film  had not any well own  actors an director  this is a very low budget film but very good shot to camcorder film that had inspired other films like diary of the dead quarantine cloverfield  and paranormal activity this is a great horror documentary   reviews by critics    scary as hell peter travers roling stone magaizine    geninely frightening john anderson newsday    one of the creepiest films since the exorcist chris nasbawatay entertainment weekly     chills you right the core dennis dermody paper    thumbs up creative inventive and ingenious roger ebert siskel and ebert and chicago sun times    this a great horror film by daniel myrick and edurado sanchez had both wrote a great script and directed this film wonderfully this a creepy must see and this is the most suceessful independent film of all time this a great horror indie this is a must see highly recommended
Dec 28 2009,positive,i dont know about one the scariest movies every made but it was spooky  however for some reason i found this movie very entertaining  it does have a good ending though
Dec 27 2009,neutral,boring ish til very end
Dec 27 2009,negative,it didnt get good until the end
Dec 24 2009,positive,when i first saw this movie i almost died a little bitits a shocker and insanely intense
Dec 24 2009,negative,creepy not good but creepy
Dec 23 2009,positive,im one of the few people who actually enjoyed this movie
Dec 22 2009,negative,so boring gave me a headache
Dec 20 2009,positive,i loved it when it first came out the style of the movie is brilliant making it feel that its real and not made up
Dec 20 2009,negative,omg even a shyamalan ending is better
Dec 19 2009,positive,i hav never been scared dis much  dis film is a mus watch wit lights off  i couldnt whistle 4 sumtime aft watchin d complete movie  dat too d climax  omg
Dec 17 2009,negative,we only get creeped out when we pretend to be the 4th character but as the outside looking inwhen you hear stuff like that you try your best to get out by following the path and light after a few amount of days you would expect them to the suspense of the blair witch the stories of the children all very sound and mysterious what you dont know is what you fear technique works well but when you try to piece the story together there is no intention and no harmony and really no horror just a huge practical joke the so called force seems more like two dudes screwing around with the lady    and in the end it is so cruel not just for the audiencelooked like a witch was doing this but for heather donahue     in the end your like wtf     not for the out of no where ending but the fact that there is a out of no where ending
Dec 16 2009,positive,haha i was one of the dumbasses who like this
Dec 15 2009,positive,this movie was ok i thought it was going 2 be scary but it was not  still good though
Dec 13 2009,positive,i saw this movie when i was 16 at night then i had to go sleep in a campground in a tent yeah think about that for a minute scary as shit for a teenager not so much for adults still a good concept though nothing like this had really been done up to that time loved the marketing scheme where they made it seem like it had really happened to these people sucked me in but remember i was 16 still holds centimental value to me
Dec 13 2009,positive,my views on this movie are mixed but the overall impact and the structuring of the movie are enough for me to appreciate it and i will admit that i was slightly creeped out at times my biggest complaint comes from the fact that the movie is almost a chore to sit through because it almost seems to become one big fight and whine understandably but still and i literally have gotten headahces from it the two times i have sat through it i can understand both sides of the spectrum as i am pretty divided on the film but as of now i am giving it a semifavorable review
Dec 12 2009,positive,this is a one kind of the movie that again you either love and terrified with it or get bored with the camera angle and say this is sucks for me i have the different views which is taking for both for the bad things first the movie is not even close to terrifying if you know the fact that it is made up not from the real story also the moving style of home video camera was really annoying however the very great part is this is sooooo convincing with the amazing  performance of the actors and the nature which seems so real
Dec 12 2009,negative,i once heard a guy saying that he liked cloverfield and quarantine but hated this movie i love cloverfield and quarantine but ive not seen blair witch project and call that guy a douchebag    after watching it myself initial thoughts on my head goes im a douchebag
Dec 10 2009,positive,are you kidding me this movie is extremely underrated by the majority of the movie going public with a minuscule budget the blair witch project was able to achieve great success with a brilliant marketing plan trick people into thinking the events were real you see this same marketing technique used to today paranormal activity and 4th kind both not as good as blair witch another milestone in blair witch was the realistic acting and the ever increasing drama of the movie some people claim  you never see anything although true if you saw something it would definitely detract from the realism of the movie watch the movie it will definitely keep your attention
Dec 9 2009,negative,saw it didnt like it  paranormal was a lot better
Dec 8 2009,positive,one of the eeriest and most impressively puttogether independent horror films that made a huge success
Dec 8 2009,positive,creepy ass movie scared me
Dec 7 2009,positive,an extremely ground breaking and unique way to tell a story with an ending that will leave you saying
Dec 7 2009,positive,a horror film which truly delivers the scares i literally couldnt sleep afterwards
Dec 7 2009,positive,this is the best thriller ive seen scarey as hell plus the filming genre was something different to that of other movies
Dec 6 2009,positive,this is one of those movies that you either loved or hated there really doesnt seem to be any middle ground on the spectrum of feelings for witch needless to say i loved it yes its just a bunch of doushebags running around the forest yes theyre running away from a ghost that may not even be there yes you could have gotten better camera work from a cokedup 80 year old with parkinsons disease but thats what makes it good it feels real and it scared the shit out of people it borrowed that realistic approach from movies such as the infamous cannibal holocaust but employed it to better effect thats why it was so successful great movie that should really be experienced in a theater with an audience
Dec 5 2009,positive,great acting the ending was lacking in information for me but was still a real original chiller
Dec 5 2009,positive,whilst the ending and even the film itself will spilt people apart on their opinion of the film i found it to be a highly orginal and scary film
Dec 3 2009,positive,unbelivieablly scary and haunting
Dec 2 2009,positive,scary one  havent seen another like this one
Dec 2 2009,neutral,i was waiting to be really really scared that i forgot to get scared in the cinema but the great thing about this movie is how it stays in your mind and creeps you out for days afterward a classic new twist on horrors that made a huge impact on a generation
Dec 1 2009,negative,although the idea and plot are spoton the lack of script proves this movie fatal as time and time again we hear arguments over the map which tree we just passed etc etc also very state of the art movie equipment so no one brought a cell phone
Dec 1 2009,positive,when you think about how this film was made for next to no money and that it was made by a couple of people with little experience you have to take that into account that being said i didnt think the film was great and thought it was over hyped not bad though and much better than some attempts at horror films ive seen
Nov 30 2009,positive,relying on the technique of exposing the audiences common  fears the dark strange sounds fantastic improvisation and making a movie look disturbingly realistic through the use of video cameras allows the blair witch project to rank as one of the scariest movies ever made
Nov 30 2009,positive,truly a cult fim so scary and psychologically unnerving
Nov 29 2009,positive,it was great when i believed it was real lol
Nov 29 2009,negative,not so much a brilliant film as it is a brilliant marketing campaign helps that the majority of the film is about somethingbasically the coming apart of a team on a mission and the precarious hold filmmakermegalomaniac in miniature heather has over her two coworkers and her own feelings of insecurity and panic actually it looks really good compared to recent more expensive effortscloverfield paranormal activity to name a few should really be seen after watching the documentary curse of the blair witch to get all the background info or at least visit the website beforehand preferably without knowing if its real or not all that said why on earth did mike throw that map away
Nov 29 2009,positive,well the ending creeped me out anyway
Nov 29 2009,positive,it was ok at the time but the nostalgia wore off quick for me
Nov 29 2009,negative,overrated uneventful annoying how did this make so much money
Nov 28 2009,positive,this movie was very supenseful but no 100 for two reasons 1 it gave birth to such a cliche genere in movies and the part where the girl is crying is funny and disgusting because of her mocosboogers
Nov 28 2009,negative,i bought this at blockbuster for like 599 the other night after discussing with friends how it really did scare the hell out of me the first and only time i watched it  a friend hooked me up w a screener copy and we watched it at my sisters apartment where the electricity inexplicably cut out halfway through  ten years later i could not have been less scared  maybe because i knew how it ended  maybe because i now know we never actually get to see anything  either way i wish i could go back to blockbuster and return it as i highly doubt i will ever reach for it again in fairness we tried to rent it first but it was inexplicably already checked out
Nov 27 2009,negative,just wasnt that scary the shaking of the camera just didnt give you time to get scared i heard a lot of people got sick from this the way to scare people is to truly just make things jump out from what it seems this movie had a scary concept and after you see it you do feel weird but the overall movie just didnt cut it
Nov 26 2009,positive,this movie was a throwback to olden time  less is more was the attitude and it worked  the movie was made the way films should be made it builds up suspense by not showing the evil that lurks in the woods  it does not throw all its cards on the table but it plays on the fear of the unknown which people have in the back of their minds  the only downfall to this movie was the things that followed its wake such as the mockumentries and book of shadows blair witch 2
Nov 24 2009,positive,i always believe that this story was real so when i watch this movie i feel something weird on me fear its just a bit of how i can describing it
Nov 23 2009,negative,there was nothing scary about this film and it was frankly retarded  who in their right mind continues to film when their life is in danger  by attempting to be too realistic the film makers made the film extremely unrealistic  totally unbelievable story  made me want to bitch slap the characters to put the god damn camera down      i love horror moviesbut only when they are well done and actually scary
Nov 22 2009,positive,may make you giddy but a good one besides its promotion is a lesson in marketing too
Nov 22 2009,positive,i got to see this film when i was in high school so scary imagine your self being lost in the forest and someone you didnt even see and know try to kill you and your friends whose with you and finally you will learn that one of your friend is the killer this horror classic film was sooo remarkable
Nov 21 2009,positive,the first time i saw it i almost pissed myself it seemed so real you can feel their panic greeeaaaaat movie
Nov 21 2009,positive,it does scary me a lot
Nov 20 2009,positive,the blair witch project is one of the scariest movies i have seen ever  it uses its low budget and documentary style techniques to its advantage in making the audience feeling like it is really there thus making the experience scarier  what also makes this movie an excellent horror film is the reality of the situation  it is not unrealistic to be in the situation they are in trapped in forest that offers them a little more than they can handle  the chemistry between the cast is fantastic
Nov 19 2009,positive,one of two movies that ever scared me
Nov 19 2009,positive,i was the only one laughing in the theater and i got flack for it but it was still exciting i thought it was real like most suckers
Nov 18 2009,positive,its really well done for what it is even though its an accidental ripoff of cannibal holocaust the acting was kinda corny not to say that it wasnt realistic for moronic film students who wanted to film a documentary about a witch the main reason it works is because of that fear of the unknown but when you dont deliver at all it tends to get annoying
Nov 18 2009,neutral,i can honestly say that i am not scared by blair witch project sure it has its moments but i dont really like the mockdocumentary film style the ending itself actually kind of sucks i was expecting something scary but the camera falls over there i spoiled the ending now i cant recommend the movie because you know exactly what happens its certainly an important movie as it proved that you can make a movie without needing millions of dollars like hollywood movies always seem to use its not a terrible movie and thats quite an accomplishment considering the budget the acting is actually pretty well done and that was surprising still blair witch project just wasnt scary enough for a fresh rating  final score 50
Nov 18 2009,positive,i remember the first time i watched this film my brother caught me off guard when i was only 12 years old he told me we were going to go to the theaters and watch a scary film my perception on horror movies during those days and even more so now are that they are absolute crap they do not care about the bigger picture the story the imagination and at that age of my life i had never seen anything like the blair witch project i pretty much thought it was going to be another washed up flick using the same tactics in the predecessors before it but i was completely and utterly wrong    what followed was the biggest and most frightening experience of my life i had no idea what i had gotten myself into and i had almost shit my pants i didnt see a trailer of this movie before i saw it didnt read the synopsis my brother didnt tell me anything about it by the end of the movie i couldnt stop thinking about the characters and the blair witch     this movie is absolutely fucking brilliant the creatorsactors are geniuses ive never been so scared in my entire life
Nov 17 2009,negative,waste of my time watching this
Nov 16 2009,positive,awesome movie haters can kiss my ass
Nov 16 2009,positive,oh my days i hid in the cinema
Nov 15 2009,positive,it was pretty good kinda suspenseful
Nov 15 2009,positive,one of the best horror films out there
Nov 14 2009,positive,this movie also scared me but still cool
Nov 13 2009,negative,lame i hated this film not scary at all this so stupid i rather go out in the woods at 300am then watch this stupid film
Nov 13 2009,positive,i remember when this first came out and hearing how awful it was so i didnt bother  then one night i was in the mood for a scary movie and this happen to be on  i felt the camera work enhanced the experience remember people complaining about that and the actors did pretty well  having said that the sob scene was a bit gross  while some areas of this were silly it was enough to scare me  which if i am not mistaken was its intended purpose
Nov 12 2009,negative,simply put this movie was a massive dissapointment not sure what so many people see in this movie yes its a little creepy at times but nothing more
Nov 12 2009,positive,34this film does what other horror films have rarely done leaves you scared as hell even when the film is over
Nov 12 2009,positive,the blair witch project is that sort of film that leaves you in the edge of your seat throughout the movie it has a lot of creepy moments such as the parts where they find the sign of the blair witch a very creepy and disturbing movie who ever says that paranormal activity is better and scarier then this is crazy
Nov 12 2009,negative,this movie made me mad because the marketing was 10x better than the movie  nearly everything about this movie was awful
Nov 10 2009,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this old movie again
Nov 9 2009,positive,pure undistilled absolute this isnt a stylized entertainment piece its raw true terror a landmark horror film im sorry but you cant call yourself a horror fan if youre one of those idiots who thinks blair witch is boring those people dont know what a film is
Nov 9 2009,positive,ive seen lots of horror moves and i only really liked the new dawn of the dead because im a huge zombie nerd but i really loved this movie and the scaryness it holds  esspecially when you go camping in the woods right after
Nov 9 2009,positive,the blair witch project was creepy disturbing and wicked it takes place when three film students went missing in 1994 and a year later their footage was found this evidence was proof to explain unimaginable horrors  which can lurk in your very souls and turn your heart black like shadows it was a tragedy to see such genuises go missing in the forest but wherever they are they are in the earths hell hole populated by an evil old spirited wicked witch who died with a history a great    plot based on a true story this creeper was defintely creepy and scary    performance not real acting but this is real enough to persuade the audience the horrors of true nightmares    writing they scream they run away no script was posted but this is what real horror looks like    productions they went into the forest with cameras and sound edit equipment and they set off the trip for the blair witch    finalize the real horror of nightmares lurks upon this documentary watch if you dare
Nov 9 2009,positive,a must see which pioneered a different type of scary movie
Nov 8 2009,positive,the blair witch project is curiously engaging film that uses its mockumentary feel to great effect to generate several moments of bone chilling suspense that are not only scary but also capture how a person stuck in those circumstances would react              this is the first horror film in my life that i actually found scary
Nov 8 2009,positive,nostalgia based rating
Nov 8 2009,positive,absolutely terrifying
Nov 8 2009,positive,pretty scary ind of boring though
Nov 8 2009,positive,scared if you believed in it looking forward to paranormal activity
Nov 7 2009,positive,loved it or hated it i loved it
Nov 7 2009,neutral,mostly overrated mystery behind it is wellspun though and leaves you wondering but the buildup and most of it is annoying
Nov 7 2009,negative,this movie was offensively horrible this last halloween i read an article on how this movie could still deliver shivers and i thought to myself yes if your talking shivers and quivers like im running to the bathroom cause i ate some really bad chinese food i dont want name drop cause that guy must have been paid to write any type of review that would reflect favorably on this movie and he must have used that money to support his crack cocaine habit
Nov 6 2009,positive,it was a very unique horror movie experience  i feel that horror movies are truely great when they can convince the watcher that this can really happen or is believable  the movie leaves you thinking hum maybe all those ghost stories could be true
Nov 6 2009,negative,the only thing that was good about this movie was the publicity around it the movie itself is dull shit not scary badly played and not very well made  but the fact that for some time people really believed that these events happened that was just amazing how could they manipulate everyone like that  as a movie its shit  but the publicity was an unbelievable phenomenon
Nov 5 2009,positive,amazing one of the most unsettling and uneasy movies ever created the peformances are brilliant and the dialogue is very relevant and constant even in todays day and age a masterpiece in the horror genre and wonderfully original
Nov 5 2009,negative,after i had seen paranormal activity everyone told me if i loved that i would love the blair witch project i was in best buy just recently and was looking through the sale bin and found it in there and decided to buy it i sat down on a cold and rainy night and popped it in the perfect mood for a scary movie to be seen the first part with the interviews from the people talking about the blair witch gave me a very uneasy feeling and i have always loved scary stories and was getting into this one just to tell you the movie is about three friends who go out to make a documentary on the local legend of the blair witch once they got to the woods the movie got extremely boring and pointless the acting was horrible and i dont see why people think this movie is scary the only part i found unsettling was the ending the ending was very creepy but the rest of the movie was total crap they just seemed to swear a lot in order to express their fear the girl in the movie was one of the most annoying things i have ever experienced the acting was so dramatic and overdone by the end  just didnt care anymore this just goes to show you no matter how much money your movie makes its not going to change the enjoyment factor of the film two stars
Nov 5 2009,positive,i have seen many horror movies in my lifefrom them the 65 are bullshitfrom the other 35 the 20 are very good and from this 20 only the 9 scares the shit out of methis movie belongs to this 9it is extremely scary especially at night in the moviei love the found footage direction which makes the movie very scary and very suspenseful toooh yeah this is one of my favorite horror movies of all timeperiod
Nov 5 2009,positive,this film requires an imagination and compassion for its characters to fully appreciate its creepiness
Nov 4 2009,neutral,i love when the guy throws the map away  i know several people that would get lost in the woods
Nov 4 2009,positive,watched it again recently wasnt as good as i remember
Nov 4 2009,negative,i dont know why everyone thought this was amazingnothing happened and you dont know what the hell is going on because the kids are shaking the camera too much
Nov 4 2009,positive,i hate the shaky camera but once i thought it was real until i found out everything holy shit
Nov 3 2009,negative,i thought this movie was dumb
Nov 3 2009,negative,this was the dumbest ficking movie ive ever seen talk about letdowns i demanded my money back after seeing this piece of shit daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez should pay restitution to the public then quit the industry
Nov 2 2009,negative,very overrated annoying amateurish horror effort
Nov 2 2009,neutral,the movie is one of the first to pioneer the home camera as another angle for movies but there is a reason why home cameras have never been pioneered before there is only so much a home camera can capture and it is no wounder why then that the movie has no clear story line or plot and no character development but then again what horror film has a good story line because all we expect is a good thrill the movie scores in the scare factor and in originality but it comes short in every other facet the movie has tremendous build up till the end and it leaves you with a good thrill but the movie is no more than a cheap thrill that is only good for one viewing
Nov 2 2009,positive,this was by far one of the most realistic movies i have ever seen in my life honestly if i didnt know it was fiction i would have just gone with the idea that they were just three film students who disappeared up in the forest and some people found their film judging from all the movies that recently have tried to do the whole shaky handheld camera thing these days that just goes to show how groundbreaking this was for coming out in 1999 nobody had ever seen any horror movie like this it was filmed as if it was a documentary which made it completely devoid of any music at all which just succeeded in making this film all the more creepy it truly explores the human mind and the descent into insanity as it becomes more and more likely that they will die out in the forest this movie contains some of the creepiest scenes i have ever seen without so much as showing who is stalking them or showing a drop of blood that in itself is a feat that only a great movie can pull off the one thing that i was not a fan of in this movie was the ending it ended way too sudden but in a way i guess it fit the whole nonconformity to the normal horror movie genre this is just a fantastic movie that starts out a little slow but the suspense level just keeps rising and rising until the very last scene
Nov 2 2009,positive,great idea but gets annoying at times  not really creepy so much as it is disparaging
Nov 2 2009,positive,one of the best horror films ever 
Nov 2 2009,positive,suspenseful while youre watching but kind of goofy when you think about it afterwards
Nov 2 2009,positive,this film is scary because u never see whats getting them looks so real aswell
Nov 1 2009,positive,ive read online that this is one of the scariest movie of all time bullshit but still kind of good    i remember that in an old episode of family guy brian the dog took a blind guy to see this movie so he narrated the movie to the guy like this nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens something about a map nothing happens nothing happens the end and itexactly what happens nothing happens in most parts of the movie but still great and intense    i tought id be terrified about this movie but after it was over i didnt felt anything i mean i felt hungry after seeing they without food and the guy eating a leaf but i wasnt scared at all altough while watching it i felt really involved with the movie and even a bit scared at the scene where they hear children talking outside but after the movie nothing    the cast was very shit but i think thats why the movie was so succefull who went to see this movie thought it was real so it was scarier but fi fuck it    i hope that paranormal activity is better than this
Nov 1 2009,positive,it was one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time it was pretty scary because you didnt know what was was doing everything there was one scene in the movie i thought was very well done there was only one thing i didnt like about it which was the ending it was disappointing
Nov 1 2009,neutral,the blair witch project is worthy of distinction on several fronts first it was the highest grossing independent film since another horror film halloween second it launched the documentary style of horror film widely replicated by many films subsequently third the movie was the first to be marketed almost solely through internet and word of mouth    in 1999 every one heard about this little film that came out of nowhere to scare audiences at the sundance film festival the wordofmouth from sundance created this buzz about the film that subsequently made it the number one film the weekend it was released    i was in the audience that first weekend to watch the film my initial reaction at the end of it was eh it was ok i could see why people trapped in a snowy mountain at night got scared by it but honestly i think the blair witch project is the most overpromised and underdelivering movie in history    the film follows three students in the woods to find evidence of a witch as they get lost in the woods weird things begin to happen to them and onebyone they disappear whenever you have a movie with only three characters you better make sure they are actors that can carry an entire film in my opinion joshua leonard and michael williams are completely forgettable in this film and i wanted to forget heather donahue halfway through never has an actress achieved such an irritating pitch since faye dunaway in mommie dearest in fact when i went to see the film most of the audience was hoping she would get killed by the witch she was so overthetop annoying    the movie was more chaotic then scary which was the real letdown it was so stylized it was hard to figure out what was going on sometimes that is well done and the audience fills in the gaps which is obviously what we are supposed to do however given the fact there is absolutely nothing to clue us in other than some rocks sticks bones and shadows i found the whole thing more of a bad lsd trip and not even as scary as that would be    if the movie had not been so ingenious in its hype and first weekend sales this movie would be summarily dismissed as an arty attempt at horror fine to see once but not much there to support another view
Nov 1 2009,negative,dont get what all the hype was about ive been trying to find away to claw back the time wasted watching this film cheesy porn version was better
Oct 31 2009,positive,when i watched this i was warned that it was stupid and not scary rather hilarious in fact however i sat down and began to watch it with an unbiased mindset and found that for the entire duration of the film i was completely motionless the idea of it being on an old handheld camera makes you almost one of the characters the tension throughout the film is kept by the steady breakdown of the friendships and of the ability to reason properly as the film progresses and the night time intrusions become more intense the idea of being totally lost in the forest pursued by an unseen force that leaves and forboding totems hanging from trees it really tenses you up thinking what you would do in their postion all in all a really good thriller if you ignore the general concensus
Oct 31 2009,positive,this film just shows that you dont need a huge budget or buckets of blood to make a movie scary as hell the most realistic and scariest film of the 90s became the most profitable movie in history and its not hard to see why it will make you scared all over again every single time you watch it its funny how films with the most simple concepts are scarier than films with big budgets and special effects
Oct 31 2009,positive,about as scary as camping by yourself
Oct 31 2009,negative,dumbest movie ever i kept waiting for it to get good or for something to happen and just when i thought it was getting started it ended awful movie poorly made and got talked about more then it deserved
Oct 30 2009,positive,not scary but i still enjoy it for many other reasons
Oct 30 2009,positive,910    superb film i just couldnt help but feel it was missing something
Oct 30 2009,neutral,i personaly did not enjoy this film very much but i must admit that even 11 years later the film still manages to retain its very primal factors that made it so chilling it also works well as a guide to amature filmmakers who dont want to be eten by ghosts
Oct 30 2009,positive,a great scary thriller film that delivers great entertainment and lots of scares this film comes highly recommended
Oct 30 2009,positive,scariest movie ever need i say more
Oct 29 2009,positive,years after the hype died down the movie still stands on its own its time to rediscover this one
Oct 29 2009,positive,not a long movie but seems to drag on good story though
Oct 29 2009,positive,freaky gives you a headache and dark perfect combination
Oct 29 2009,negative,i saw it because everyone said i should
Oct 29 2009,positive,we never happen to watch this witch only some hints about her presence the strong point is the psychological terror the movie tries to show this is a well crafted project to make believe the public about a supposed real documentary on a witch living  in the woods the finale is kinda of enigmatic and creepy
Oct 28 2009,positive,i saw this in theaters 4 times when it came out lol
Oct 28 2009,positive,i cant believe it took me until today to watch the blair witch project i was completely shocked by how much i loved this innovative creepy as hell incredible the acting was totally convincing the ending was terrifying i loved this maybe my favorite horror film since the shining
Oct 28 2009,positive,i really enjoyed this film when it was released a very good example of this type of film directiom
Oct 28 2009,positive,90100  im not sure why there is so much hate for this movie  it was very well done  it made up a story about a woman accused of being a witch send out deep in the woods in the dead of winter to seemlingly die and an elaborate story of creepy things happening in the woods like the children pulled under water in the creek the water having the ooze forcing farmers to move their cattle the guy who saw the blair witch and had her voice tell him to kill these kids one of which survived but was institutionalized due to the experience  i probably would have enjoyed this more if the main woman was hotter but it made it more realistic that a film student who loves the outdoors isnt super hot  she wasnt butt ugly either though    this movie wasnt just the people in the woods screaming and hearing noises  it had important landmarks that were visited those symbols hanging from the trees were a good visual and something recognizable about the movie if you see a twigman do you not think of this movie had a scene that will live in parody legend for many years to come with the girl videotaping up her nose the bloody thing left by the camp site  nobody knows what it is  my wife constantly asks what it was was it a tongue  an organ  we are not supposed to know exactly what it is only that its part of their friendthese things help a movie live on i dont remember too many famous quotes in this movie but movie quotes like ill be back from arnold is just another example of something in a movie to help make it memorable and live on in film noir    the acting was pretty good too for people who are not really actors  you go through their emotions of being scared mad at each other when they lose the map must be truly scarey if you get lost in the woods forget about a ghost witch being there the woods in themselves is a scarey place to be      can anyone truly tell me that the ending wasnt as effective as could be thought up  hearing their friend screaming in the house to entice them to go into the house even the idea of one guy holding the audio and you hear the girls voice off to a distance  it was so real  then when you finally see the guy standing in the corner in the basement thats all part of the story of what the guy hearing the voices did to the kids before killing them  you know its over for the woman      it was advertised so masterfully that some gullible people actually thought it was true  would this be put into a theatrical release if it was real not sure how people thought that i just saw it as a real clever setup  the viral marketing and the big backstory made up for this was amazing  i love ghost stories and scarey backwoods so this movie played right into my tastes  the fact that you can google this topic and find tons of material on it make the blair witch project more than just a movie think cloverfield with the stuff they made up like the slushee drink and things to look for in the movie that enrich the experience love viral marketing    maybe you get sick watching the handheld camera shots maybe you want to actually see a person hack up another to get your horror thrills but this was so different it now holds a place in my heart and is a piece of nostalgia so id love it even if it didnt age well years from now
Oct 28 2009,negative,one of the few horror movies where i actually fell asleep in the cinema whilst watching it  watch cannibal holocaust man bites dog or the last broadcast instead
Oct 28 2009,negative,not good enoughnice concept but nthin scary
Oct 27 2009,positive,the phenomenal horror film that raved the critics in 1999 this film was really impressive it has to be the best first person film it served the audience fear tension and terror this film was pure genius in every way
Oct 27 2009,negative,lame my toilet could do a better job
Oct 27 2009,positive,brilliantly minimalist
Oct 27 2009,positive,holy crap this movie was terifying  i watched this with my friends and now i never want to go into the woods again  the real scare is the not whats there but whats not there  the three students heather mike and josh dont even know if something is in the woods  the real reason it scared me though was the fact that is was so realistic  because it had no zombies vampires werewolves etc it can really happen  it also is based on a fake ghost story that is very famous not the exact story but a different one in each town  a witch kidnaps kids and kills them in the woods is about half the ghost stories out there  even though this movie had a crappy sequel and maybe a third movie it is still in my top 10 movies of all time
Oct 27 2009,neutral,most retarded movie of my teen days
Oct 27 2009,positive,a little boring  pretty traumatizing
Oct 27 2009,positive,i can understand why people wouldnt like this movie it didnt really go anywhere and the camera movement is a lot to take in but i personally liked this film its unique from any other thriller film ive seen before
Oct 26 2009,positive,the hype for this movie was so well played out  very original
Oct 25 2009,positive,the film is a brilliant  it is a genre of its own  the ending is phenomenal  u got to see it
Oct 25 2009,positive,different from the normal scary movie no replay value for me
Oct 25 2009,positive,scared da crap out of me so freaky
Oct 25 2009,positive,creepy and pretty cool even though the ending is a little too ambiguous for its own good
Oct 25 2009,positive,a brilliant horror film unfortunately i just cant be scared
Oct 25 2009,positive,awesome though the sequel was such a pile of crap
Oct 25 2009,positive,possibly one of the most important films in the recent years as it highlights the obsession with reality and is a clear representation of postmodernism ideas this movie is only heightened recently with the release of paranormal activity and still remains an important film overall the film is slow in places but truly scary for the time it manages to be scary without relying in guts but rather the suspense and fear of the unknown which appeals to everyones primal fear of the night
Oct 24 2009,negative,this is a boring film nothing happens the whole film is about people screaming and a bit of running around a bad movie
Oct 24 2009,positive,is the blair witch project a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multimedia event it is both the picture shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared documentarylike frame is quirky annoying and spectacularly scary the scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me the gimmick that the blair witch project is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life now we all know the truth but the french term cinema verite is defined by this grisly film    a guaranteed cult classic blair witch has heather mike and josh heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of maryland looking for the blair witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills for most of the film it is very unclear the beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a experiencing the supernatural b being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c just completely out of their minds its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option a    most filmgoers know that the filmmakers sanchez and myrick used their mac cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and i commend them this is a tourdeforce thriller that does indeed seem real its all improvised and verite like and the best part about the movies many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us we are generally frightened by what we cannot see many times throughout the film the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery for the sake of the suspense the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick the realism is sometimes smothering    true the handheld camera can make you achy in the head but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart i viewed the film on dvd with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow myrick and sanchez to do what they were attempting to do spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and i was reminded of robert wises original the haunting from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks a babys giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own    much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before the blair witch project was released i never saw it and if it was as good as this film we wouldve seen it nonetheless this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around in the woods no one can hear you scream either
Oct 24 2009,negative,how could anyone give this movie a good rating is beyond me i was laughing at how incredibly bad it was while watching it in the theater back when it came out it was so hyped and such a utter bore come on some sticks ties together and hang them on a tree and how truly unrealistic could you make something i would have left if the people i went with didnt want to finish it one of the worst movies all time in my opinion
Oct 24 2009,negative,influenced other movies to copy the style but for me the film is boring
Oct 23 2009,positive,pretty cool  very well done  didnt creep me out as much as rec but it definitely had the balls  great
Oct 23 2009,negative,as legend is to dristan blair witch is to dramamine    the concept was good but only effective as long as the audience believed that this movie was vaugely plausible
Oct 22 2009,negative,not really scary actually alittle boring
Oct 22 2009,positive,well it was one of the more earthshattering and groundbreaking films of the 90s and ushered in a whole new handheld horror craze that is still being used today the blair witch project is the grandfather to films like paranormal activity that has mirrored the craze that is currently sweeping america    what makes the blair witch project so important is that it really marks one of the first times that such a lowbudget movie found such a mainstream audience and made a boat load of cash opening the flood gates for future filmmakers it sparked the creativity in a generation of bored twentysomethings  put a camera in their hand and got them out there making lowbudget pieces of cinema gold     so while not the best movie and to be honest with you most of the film is forgettable what the movie did for independent cinema outweighs everything else
Oct 22 2009,positive,i dont think many people understood this movie that was possibly down to the marketing and hype who knows i thought this movie was a good attempt harks back to cannibal holocost in concept but doesnt have half as much impact not a horror movie as what most people were led to believe but more of a psychological thriller dont get me wrong it is weak as hell in points and theres not alot in it but theres something about this movie that makes me argue its case every time its mentioned
Oct 21 2009,negative,the last broadcast did it betterwell aslong as you ignore the ending
Oct 21 2009,positive,i cant believe i forgot how absolutely perfect blair witch is it never gives you anymore than what you need
Oct 21 2009,positive,terrifying but gave me serious motion sickness
Oct 20 2009,positive,watched it again in preparation for paranormal activity  there are haters of this movie out there but i still remember looking around a completely silent theater at one point in the show and thinking is everyone even breathing in tandem right now  the reality aspect gets a little tired about half way through but overall the show proves that lessismore when it comes to scares
Oct 20 2009,positive,great film till this day i believe it has the record for highest gross profit because the film was so cheap to make but caked millions
Oct 20 2009,positive,i actually got freaked out by this hahaha and i saw it for the first time in 2006
Oct 19 2009,negative,i never saw the movie in the theater admittedly when i see movies like this in the theater it adds to the experience i ended up renting this and i was underwhelmed and quite bored
Oct 19 2009,neutral,i feel so left out the entire world screamed their heads off and i had to stifle a yawn i honestly wish that i couldve been as scared as i should have been but    although i must say that the last few minutes of the movie really got me going then it ended
Oct 18 2009,positive,the last half an hour is what is truly terrifying  i can promise you that the first hour is creepy within itself but the last half an hour that is what will haunt every last fear you have
Oct 18 2009,negative,simply awful but the premise was good
Oct 18 2009,positive,it scared the crap out of me
Oct 17 2009,neutral,you know i heard it was very scary and i was looking for a scare this morning it didnt deliver i kept waiting for it to get scary and to make me jump but it never did the ending was creepy as was the whole movie but it wasnt scary at all disappointed
Oct 17 2009,negative,really never fell for the hype surrounding this one
Oct 16 2009,neutral,in the news today had camera work like this 6 years before it
Oct 16 2009,positive,this movie was quite scary when i was 8    and now its largely irritating because of the constantly bickering characters but sprinkled throughout are a few choice spooky moments
Oct 15 2009,positive,paranormal activitys big brother
Oct 15 2009,positive,how can you not like this
Oct 15 2009,positive,i just loved the movie even though i saw it very late and on dvd  i must admit it was a bit creepy watching at night alone but i pulled through  first of all i loved the movie and then when i read about how it was done i was even more impressed  how often do you get a movie based almost entirely on improvisation i liked the acting a lot and the whole plot  first off heather donahue was really good as the girl trying to hard to get her work done and screwing up everyones chance of living  its in the script so i still like heather  it was just a well done movie  they never show the villainwhether it the witch or the man possessed by thw witch  and if the last seen isnt creepy i dont know what is  all in all great job by producers and actors
Oct 15 2009,negative,one of the worst films ever conceived
Oct 14 2009,positive,pretty good horror film i like how the ending tied back to what was said in the interviews earlier in the film although i was expecting this to be like rec suspenseful build up to an intense quick terrifying ending but instead this film was all build up to pretty much nothing scary at all i personally thought this film had excellent acting i was really convinced these people were ticked half the time even though i found the main character really annoying oh yeah and theres no witch so dont expect to see one i found that very disappointing    worth checking out for anyone looking for a cheap thrill by yourself or with friends personally i thought the film would have been infinitely scarier and better if there really was a witch
Oct 12 2009,positive,i think this movie was really good the way that your mind is what made it so scary made the movie amazing it was really intense and had me hiding behind my pillow although this is almost a classic movie i think paranormal activity was a great upgrade of this movie so if you liked this movie and thought it was freaky see paranormal activity your opinion will completely change but i still think this movie was really good
Oct 12 2009,positive,good movie spooky and has tragic ending  one thing i dont like the camera movement make me dizzy    this movie remains me of one japan horror movie noiri
Oct 12 2009,positive,i was going to give 4 stars but i realized that this is fake
Oct 11 2009,negative,total waste of time
Oct 11 2009,positive,the scariest movie i have seen in a while absolutely amazing whether the people were just actors or it was actual footage of the people than the actors did a damn good job of displaying what it is like to be affraid and hunted excellent movie
Oct 11 2009,positive,a true treat for all fans or horror
Oct 11 2009,negative,dumb there was only one part that was even a tiny bit scary  the teeth in the twigs  thats it  dont waist your time
Oct 11 2009,positive,what to say about thisi whent to see it at the cinema and was bored now i love it
Oct 10 2009,positive,i watched this tonight for the second time after watching it back in 99 or 2000 and i can honestly say that it is still one of the very few movies that actually scares me the maryland woods are pretty too
Oct 10 2009,positive,decent movie scared me a bitespecially the end shudders
Oct 9 2009,negative,it may have been scarry if i cared about the characters they were so stupid that half way through the movie i was actually hopping that they would die soon
Oct 8 2009,negative,utter overhyped shite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen apart from cloverfield
Oct 8 2009,negative,utter overhyped shite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen apart from cloverfield
Oct 7 2009,positive,it really freaks me out when i first saw it i wanted to go search for those kidsthen i found out it was all made up
Oct 4 2009,positive,i dont think this is a movie quite like this its basic horror and feels real without the hollywood special effects being filmed on a video camera makes you feel like your there
Oct 3 2009,positive,as dumb as it seems now you definately have to giv them credit for making what is now known as a classic with such a small budget
Oct 1 2009,positive,one of the few genuinely scary movies i have seen the atmosphere and isolation of these characters are what makes this movie work this also features some of the best acting i have ever seen from a teenage cast watching this alone and in the dark really makes you feel that you are there in the forest with these people this now ranks as one of my favorite horror films
Oct 1 2009,positive,proof you dont need million of dollars to make a good movie  and freak the crap out of people  note to selfnever watch alone without your back against a wall at night with open windows all around in the middle of the country one time was pleanty d
Oct 1 2009,positive,the first time i saw this i thought it was real when it was finished i couldnt move coz i was so fucking scared this is so creepy i like the concept coz it makes the film feel realistic we havent seen anything like this ive never heard of the blair witch the problem i had was probably the pacing and the drama with the characters but when it was night wow scared the shit out of me the atmosphere they build up with the sounds and voices is done so very well the scene where they hear children laughing outside their tent scared the fucking shit out of me this is a delight to see and youll have a good ol time if you love this creepy stuff
Sep 30 2009,positive,lembrom que me assustou bastante mas nunca o vi por completo por esse motivo    i remember that it scared me a lot and because of that i never saw it completly
Sep 29 2009,positive,i saw it years ago but i cant remember
Sep 29 2009,negative,only thing scary about this film is the camera work
Sep 27 2009,positive,freaky until i found out it wasnt real
Sep 27 2009,positive,is it real or fake i never knew until three years after i saw it it wasnt that bad but it wasnt good
Sep 27 2009,negative,this movie is really stupid
Sep 26 2009,positive,the blair witch project is an interesting mockumentary with an intriguing concept that was the victim of many bad decisions in the process of making it and especially of promoting it the ambition it seems was to create an experimental arthouse film that would appeal to mainstream audiences and by marketing it as a horror movie create surprise and buzz the attempt to bridge the gap between the two viewer groups was quite positive but what it actually achieved is alienating both the horror crowd was disappointed and annoyed especially younger viewers who snicked into an r rated movie expecting gore and headson horror and the more sophisticated avant garde crowd turned off from day one by the films promotion didnt even bother to go see it    a decade later its easier to put all that aside as well as the internetbased hype generated by the producers at the time the film can now be appraised as what it is an exercise in experimental filmmaking and an interesting one at that it takes a lesson from the true great classics of horror  in that the fear of the unknown the anxiety and anticipation of violence are much more effective than explicit violence in itself  and indeed its scarier than almost any horror movie created in the last twenty years although the teenagers who usually go for that kind of movie will probably disagree the blair witch project creates tension and anxiety and draws the viewer into the characters world and it doesnt matter one bit whether or not you think it might be real  in fact its more impressive when you know that its not    unfortunately it doesnt achieve true greatness in that respect either in its attempt to bridge between mainstream horror and experimental indie moviemaking the film reaches a sort of middle ground that isnt quite here nor there not quite satisfying anybody the blair witch project is not a classic or a great film nor will it ever be but it should be watched by fans of independent and experimental cinema and of classic horror and remembered as a brave and innovative experiment that didnt quite make it
Sep 26 2009,positive,a very good film they didnt have to have anything pop out at you for you to be scared they left it to your imagination as to what was happening to them and that made it better it didnt have to be overly r rated either which was nice although i wouldnt be scared the second or third time i saw it it is a very good film nonetheless now the thing with this movie is that when it first was on the internet it was sold as a true story as such when it came out it became the highest grossing independent film of all time or something like that now because of this movie no one can make a movie like this and pass it off as true case and point paranormal activities no one thought that was true despite the fact that they said it was because of this movie all that to say i really liked this movie quite a bit
Sep 26 2009,neutral,no witch is physically seen here  its more of a mindset as the rumors went or a feeling that something strange is going on and is caused by some witch out there in the woods  it was a good reenactment though of the students who brought along that video camera with them
Sep 25 2009,negative,a friend and i tried for some nights to get in and see this but couldnt cause it was packed we did eventually and wished wed not bothered
Sep 24 2009,positive,i dont know why i really like this movie  mayb its abt witch bcoz at that moment i was crazy abt witches 3
Sep 24 2009,negative,where to start its crap
Sep 23 2009,positive,this film is scary because it doesnt show the audiences anything it makes them think of things that could happen which in turn scares the audience its pure genious and with a tiny budget these two young filmmakers made a truly terrifying film this will in turn become a classic in the years to come      out of 4
Sep 22 2009,negative,this movie was hypedup way out of proportion i remember seeing this movie in the theater and leaving dissapointed couldnt help but laugh when i saw the snot pour out of her nose
Sep 22 2009,negative,complete and utter rubbish boring as hell and bloody pointless tbh i thought it was meant to be a horror film
Sep 22 2009,positive,heartpumpingly eyeshidingly tense and very very jumpy its one of those thatll genuinely rob you of sleep   if you can go camping after watching this youre braver than i
Sep 20 2009,positive,although it wasnt the sraciest movie ive ever seen i still really liked it i thought it was very good theyre arent very many scary movies out there that can make you believe that what your seeing is real when in reality its not
Sep 20 2009,positive,there are a few moments in all of film i can count them on one hand that either rubbed me the wrong way creeped me out or slightly freaked me out to call any of these scary would be a stretch when it comes to movies i do not scare easily never has there been a film that grabbed me shook me me and refused to let go until it wanted to at least not until now        i was a sopohomore in highschool when this film was released 10 years ago i remember the hype and the brilliant marketing campaign i remember the profit margians were unheard of and still are i also recall being interested for ten years i have been interested i saw the sequel it was okay but i had never seen the original i suppose i sortof wrote off the original for a time because of the okayness of the second installment the other day i went on a mission of sorts to find a copy of the original and watch it once and for all       today as i write this i am still concerned about thinking about the film too much the night that i watched it i woke up several times after i went to bed it was a defense mechanism that i activated to keep from seeing any given image from the film in my dreams i am aware of how juvenile this sounds but my jaw was dropped and my eyes were welled up the entire time i was watching the film i have never had a movie and believe when i say i have probably seen more movies than most people have that kind of effect on me i was scared the entire time i was frightened beyond reason i was speechless by the end the effect of the film was incredible and nothing short of transcendent the final scene ranks among the very best endings i have ever seen on film the movie has its detractors they say it was overhyped they say the camera work was too jerky whatever know this forget jaws if spielberg really set out to scare the shit out of you this is the film he would make five stars
Sep 18 2009,positive,easily the most orginal and intense horror film yet indeed you would need an imagination and to let go of the useless factthat its not real other than those two trivial things i shouldnt even need to mention its a homerun a genre all its own that i really dont see recieving much competition
Sep 15 2009,neutral,this one creeped me out a little but not muchit doesnt get good until close to the end
Sep 14 2009,negative,i got bored and left fourty minutes in
Sep 12 2009,negative,worst movie ever the hype was so big and i was expecting to see a really scary movie but i was thoroughly disappointed
Sep 12 2009,negative,clever idea but thats all it is one idea its boring people even if it did lead on to better things
Sep 11 2009,positive,i liked it but people in my theater were pissed i dont know what they were expecting
Sep 11 2009,positive,a movie that used all the marketing devices of movie making to a creative first by using the internet as part of its campaign    the movie is based as a docudrama with night of the living dead and this is spinal tap as influences      a trio of teens are in the maryland woods to seek out a local myth maryland has woods in the blair witch  as they hike further in the woods they get lost and suddenly odd symbols appear in the woods  the first person and amateur style of the film gets old fairly quickly  however the final 10 minutes is very effective and quite scary      based on such an original concept and a film that influenced so many others cloverfield and snakes on a plane granted they were terribleit deserves its places as one of the more influential movies of all time
Sep 7 2009,negative,the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  plan 9 not the mstk3000 version is even better than this
Sep 7 2009,negative,this movie was either loved or hated i felt somewhere in between i liked the idea of handy cam make it look real kind of filming but the actual story was not interesting
Sep 6 2009,positive,stupid yet very intense and somehow entertaining
Sep 6 2009,negative,got drunk with shot while watching
Sep 5 2009,positive,this film is the most scariest film i have ever seen this is the best horror film ever its questionable if the witch is fictional but either way this film shows people of things that can scare us when in a forest alone dont want to spoil much but its reccommeneded very underrated still get the jeepers at night from this film
Sep 5 2009,positive,this is not the kind of film that will make you jump in your seat but instead it puts us there we are hungry we are lost in the woods we have no cigs were being stalked by an unknown entity were lacking poon etc its amazing to watch these characters gradually lose their grip on reality hear strange sounds in the night find stickmen hanging from trees and end up walking in circles even though they were walking south the entire time dont expect blood and gore expect the unexpected
Sep 5 2009,neutral,personally i found the film more funny than scary
Sep 4 2009,negative,ok so the last bit freaked me out only cos i didnt get it 
Sep 3 2009,negative,this movie was just awful
Sep 3 2009,negative,stupidi am pretty sure that its fake
Sep 2 2009,neutral,good for the first time ridiculous after that
Sep 2 2009,positive,there are only a couple of scary moments in this microbudget horror movie the story if you can call it that involves three students acted convincingly by three people filming a documentary about the blair witch legend in the forest the three students had disappeared but the footage was later discoverd what the film is apparently is the footage that the three students filmed of course this is all fictional the blair witch project was filmed as if it was the footage the students filmed so the movie was filmed using a camcorder and 16mm camera so had you not known previously that the film isnt real chances are you would have thought the film was real the acting which was mostly improvised is convincing making the movie seem even more authentic so while it is not that scary the blair witch project has influenced such films as cloverfield diary of the dead and various other imitations this film proves that it is possible to make a successful movie with virtually no budget
Sep 1 2009,positive,scariest movie in history this is 100 of what actually happened no actors no crew no directors completely real
Aug 31 2009,negative,horible movie with terrible camara work peaple running around in the woodsnothing happens boring
Aug 31 2009,positive,the blair witch project plays phobia like a harp true terror isnt a man in a hockey mask its what we cant see losing the feeling of control occasionally in a movie such as final destination 2000 or nightmare on elm street 1984 i caught a glimpse of what i truly find scary losing control     the blair witch project is the final account of heather mike  josh who get lost in the woods of the town of blair during the filming of a project about a gruesome local legend i think i saw something about it on the discovery channel  the blair witch from the moment they start interviewing locals ideas are planted in their head and when it comes to getting lost that is the last thing you want on your mind the words of the interviewees echoes in their mind when they hear noises find weird piles of stones or eerie wooden shapes outside their tent after a while of being terrorised the trio begin to go a bit insane when one goes the others follow like dominoes the apparent leader heather tries to keep composed but considering the circumstances is pretty useless in a breathtaking shot heather loses her image of calm in a tearful apology to her family and to the guys where she states im too afraid to close my eyes it is then that you realise she hasnt blinked once in several minutes    have you ever walked into an abandoned building at about seven oclock in the night just when its dark enough to hide the entire inside of the building in freaky shadow remember the terror of apprehension as you hear footsteps if there ever was a movie to capture that feeling it is this that one seeing someone getting brutally tortured onscreen isnt scary at all hearing someone get brutally tortured offscreen is nerve shredding
Aug 31 2009,positive,one of those rare movies that is both entertaining and seems to have layers i have memories of crying people with runny noses and people in a corner of the basement still etch in my mind    what happened i dont know but i do remember having goosebumps for at least an hour after watching
Aug 31 2009,negative,its not scary end of i am 13 and the night after i saw one of the scariest horror films ever i slept in a tent and let me tell you i get scared very very easily un scary unchilling uninteresting
Aug 31 2009,positive,i remember discovering this movie on the internet when it was still being billed as actual found footage  it looked so damn freaky that i couldnt wait to see it in the theaters  opening weekend some friends and i piled into a car and drove to raleigh to see it  we get to the theater and every single showing is sold out  im not shouting thats actually what the sign on the window said  bummed we decided to buy tickets for the next nights showing and since we were already there we decided to see another movie deep blue sea  which you can hate on this movie all you want to but the scene where you get a good oldfashioned samual l jackson speech interupted by a shark eating his ass is just pure cinema gold  so we drove back the next night to finally see blair witch  every seat in the theater was full and i began to get nervous that people were going to talk through the whole thing  but when the previews stopped and that black screen came up with the words the blair witch project on itthe entire crowd went silent  and stayed that way through the whole film  i was terrified  this movie ruined me on camping for years  this was the first horror film that showed you nothing and yet your imagination goes into overdrive  thats the genius of it  by never showing the witch everyone sees her differently in their minds  over the years people have started to appreciate it more and its on every list of the best horror films of all time  its great man  watch it again with the lights off and the sound turned waaaay up  by the end youll be heading to the bathroom  cause you just shit your pants
Aug 31 2009,negative,rather boringit just ran around in circles until it was over  i watched the entire thing hoping it would get better at some point  it never did
Aug 30 2009,positive,some effective stuff at the end but generally overrated
Aug 30 2009,positive,enjoyable but not as scary as i thought it was going to be 45
Aug 29 2009,positive,another perfect example of the mainstream not knowing a good horror film if it bit them in the ass not only did this movie give us a refreshing moment in modern horror which was pitifully bad in the years leading up to this film but it revolutionized hollywood filmmaking plenty of hitchcock in this movie as you never see anything whatsoever its all in the viewers imagination and that is just as scary as anything you can put on film a great example that movies can be just as effective if not more so with a tiny budget and no name actors people are so quick to put down this movie for some reason but praise pos horror movies like drag me to hell and any of the horrible saw films this is a horror movie for intelligent movie goers who appriciate not being bludgened to death with every scene this is an art school style movie that is genuinely terrifying everything works to its advantage its pacing its actors its all around feel
Aug 28 2009,negative,so boring i left the cinema
Aug 26 2009,positive,best thriller ever ive never seen anything scariest in my life until 2009 rec or 2008 cloverfield but that one counts the most cause it was first maybe its not the best one today but for me for that time it was absolutely awesome it been a while since last time i saw and i think it wouldnt be so scary anymore but you just cant watch it without any thrill
Aug 26 2009,positive,the way it was filmed was revolutionary to some but what kept it together was the storyline and the acting  it felt real  it also didnt resort to idiotic things like showing someone drowning like rob zombie chose to do in the latest halloween he directed  in fact i say that movie would have been fine had he edited out that scene plus got the soundtrack right      blair witch is classic for the horror genre  definitely a top 10 movie
Aug 26 2009,positive,a legitimately scary horror film that revolutionized a genre and they did it with no money
Aug 26 2009,negative,good set up nothing happened terrible movie its a waste of time you never see anything barley hear anything and in the end its a mock documentary  boring
Aug 24 2009,positive,truely an awsome piece of cinema in which you forget your watching a film and instead seem to be in a freaky trance where all that matters is getting out of those black and terrfying woods its brilliant to think that as hollywood strives to be clever and brilliant while makign as much money as possible a college film does this well on such a basic idea this film suceeds because it breaks down the distance between audience and characters you cant tell these people are acting as you can with pretty much any hollywood or even succesful film to date there lines are realistic and flawed and human we see the trio go through an amazing array of human emotions that draw you in while reminding you that this is how you would react if you were lost and terrified youll leave this film with a fear of woods and a sceptical eye on nearly every other survival horror movie great acting great concept and in my opinion great execution
Aug 22 2009,positive,i remember the hype  i remember sitting in the movie theater absolutely terrified  i remember not caring when i later found out about the hoax
Aug 22 2009,negative,yay lets just watch a camera spinning teens swearing and screaming oh and at the end a guy pissing in the corner
Aug 21 2009,positive,one of the scariest films ive ever seenthe film has shaky camera angle techniquesand what makes the film uniquethere was nothing they were getting stalked byor even something that was after themthey were just lost in the woodsbut then you start realizing that something was after them
Aug 21 2009,positive,it was hard to believe it was not a true story  i was very convinced throughout the movie that they were not acting anymore
Aug 20 2009,positive,one of the greatest films of all time will always be my favorite film just because of how well it was done and simply the greatest ending of all time what you dont see is always the scariest it will keep you on the edge of your seat
Aug 20 2009,positive,nowadays camcorder horrors are ten a penny but back in 1999 this was a pretty revolutionary movie  shot with no script actors using their real names no budget and not even a glimpse of the eponymous title character what could so easily have been a disaster turned out to be one of the creepiest movies of the 90s and the decade that would follow  using the great jumping off point of this being the footage of 3 film students who mysteriously disappeared making a movie about a legendary witch this already has a much too real feeling to it from the beginning and if you can truly throw yourself into the movie that feeling is all it needs  this is perhaps one of the reasons why the film works much better on the small screen than it did in the cinema the video camera footage more at home on a smaller screen and away from the popcorn crunching masses  heather donahue is also not your typical horror movie female lead  at the time the post modern horror genre was in full effect and audiences were used to the likes of jennifer love hewitt neve campbell and sarah michelle geller fronting their latest dose of stalk and slash action  donahue is completely and totally normal ambitiously ruthless perhaps but no different then many other film students on a directors power trip  josh and mike are also just as nondescript and boy next door as you could get  its another way in which blair witch lays its groundwork so well  we already feel like we know these people  the early film is expertly peppered with vox pops regarding the blair witch which fills us in on what the characters already know so that when the spooky stuff does happen were just as terrified as they are  the spooky stuff itself is great  shot mostly out of focus and in the dark on swirling camera we are transfixed wondering if at any moment we may glimpse the titular witch  directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez have well crafted a movie which seems randomly put together but is in fact very tightly plotted the story advances well and the build up to the tension boiling climax is perfect  if there can be any complaint levelled at the blair witch project its that the characters could just have followed the river to get out of the forest rather than trudging around for hoursbut its a minor gripe  the blair witch project is a bold and adventurous movie which dared to do something different with the horror genre and succeeded in producing a spinetinglingly creepy and stuff of nightmares film
Aug 20 2009,negative,why cant i give no stars  it was horrible
Aug 19 2009,neutral,totally on the fence about this one thats why i split it right down the middle and it has nothing to do w the shaking camera thing
Aug 18 2009,positive,this film has so many clever frightening original terrifying outlandish and remarkable ideas that i found myself afraid to stand up and leave the theater once it finished in fear that the blair witch would get me
Aug 17 2009,positive,im scared to close my eyes but im scared to keep  them open says a terrified heather donahue after her film project to hunt down the infamous blair witch turns her and her two companions into the hunted every subtle technique that the film utilizes was perfectly effective the disclaimer in the beginning the documentary style the utilization of handheld cameras to give the sensation of actually being in those woods the unscripted dialogue and the provoked discord among the actors in an age where filmmakers rely on heavy makeup suspenseful music and computer generated images to terrify their  audiences blair witch project instead takes the far more penetrating approach of playing on its audiences most profound and primary fear the fear of the unknown and the unseen bwp demonstrates the masterful art of suspense and builtup tension rather than reverting to the current formula of horror films today a cheesy underdeveloped plot cookie cutter characters that we cannot care about sudden loud noises or momentary images of ghosts intended to make the audience jump although blair witch project might seem slow in comparison without these jumpy moments it keeps one on the edge of ones seat until the very end wonderfully chilling some of the shots in  the film were strikingly scary without being too gimmicky the exception being the parcel found outside  the tent on the last night with perhaps the best being the final shot as a person who very rarely finds herself impressed  with horror films i found the blair witch project highly effective
Aug 17 2009,positive,this film is not scary  everybody said its the scariest film ever created  i did not even think this film is scary nor creepy  however this film is interesting regarding the mystery of the blair witch  and i do give a lot of credit to the filmmakers for managing to make a homemade film with a budget no more than the price of a house
Aug 17 2009,negative,the biggest waste off a movie ever i feel dumber just watching it
Aug 16 2009,positive,a good horrorsuspense film takes it back old school when you didnt need excessive gore for it to be scary
Aug 16 2009,negative,not good for deaf people it relies on a lot of sound effects that wasnt subtitled boring as hell
Aug 16 2009,negative,i really didnt like this movie my cousin liked it but i didnt
Aug 15 2009,positive,when this first came out and saw it in the theatre it was quite an original and unique film  too bad so many copy cats came after a ruin its appeal
Aug 15 2009,neutral,this was probably the weirdest movie ive ever seen its not anything like any other movie thats ever been made its about three teens that get stuck in the woods and keep finding strange things while they videotape just about everything they do its sort of like it never really starts though after you watch it you and your friends will talk about it all day trying to figure out what really happened and what the movie was about thats what made it stand out from all the other movies and i actually liked discussing it the rest of the day so it was alright for that reason note this was my amazon review from the year 2000 you do have to give it credit for making you think and discuss it even years later but still very weird
Aug 14 2009,positive,ok not as scary as everyone said
Aug 14 2009,positive,add a review optional
Aug 13 2009,negative,this is the most ridiculous movies i ever wasted money and time on i wish it would have been better instead of just getting good at the end when the chick dies going down the stairs
Aug 13 2009,positive,smarter than people give it credit for
Aug 13 2009,positive,a really good scary film
Aug 12 2009,positive,a different point of view for a horror film where the monster is not only completely excluded but you feel as if you are the victim very well done
Aug 11 2009,positive,had to wait a decade until i saw it it was ok
Aug 9 2009,positive,this film gave me nightmares and i knew it was fake there are moments that terrify the living hell out of me im on edge the entire time the cursing and screaming gets excessive but who cares
Aug 9 2009,positive,say what you want this movie is and was revolutionary
Aug 8 2009,positive,it didnt need blood and gore like other big horror films all it needed was a hand held camera and woods and it succeeded entirely to scare the crap out of the audience as they thought that it was actually happening
Aug 8 2009,positive,what can i say i liked it
Aug 8 2009,positive,this is the scariest movie ive ever seen  i watched it at my dads place a cabin in the woods on silverstar mountain lol which of course intensified the creepiness of the film  incredible acting and the realism of the movie was amazing
Aug 6 2009,positive,very creepy the making was simple actually that is i think what made the movie look so real thats why even though i knew it wasnt real i was pretty much scared
Aug 6 2009,positive,the blair witch project succeeds as a groundbreaking horror film that provides all the suspense and thrills a good horror movie should have not to mention the documentary style that makes it seem more realistic and therefore more scary hopefully we can see more movies like this one in the future
Aug 5 2009,positive,i really didnt get why people would rave on about a movie like this i made the mistake of watching the second movie first i thought what the hell is this it isnt even real film its crap now my friends heard i saw the second movie first so they yelled at me for 8 days straight until i went out to the video store and rented it i felt the biggest sence of stupidity and guilt this movie is number one of my list of movies that will make you crap your pants when your home on a saturday night by yourself
Aug 5 2009,positive,dont no what to make of this really is it good or crap i rated it 60 because i dont think it rotten but i dont think its fantasic as well it kept me watching and the acting was good and it was a clever film is it scary not really i have seen worse
Aug 5 2009,negative,hates this movie felt sick afterwards because of the way the camera moved around totally overrated
Aug 4 2009,positive,this kind of horror movie is not for everyone as it gambles 100 on the suspense card and these types will never be good enough for some thrill seekers the key is doing is right personally this one still scares the shit outta me
Aug 4 2009,neutral,everything surrounding it was better than the actual movie but i would still not consider it completely without merit
Aug 3 2009,positive,made me not want to go into the woods or sleep for about three months after seeing it  after ten years its still pretty effective  i think the past ten years have fooled people into thinking this is a worse movie than it is because of all the movies that have stolen from it  if you watch the movie and try to clear your head of imitators youll enjoy it and it will still scare the shit out of you
Aug 3 2009,positive,i pick this as my favorite horror  flick because its the one movie that truly frightened me  a lot of people who want just blood and gore will be disappointedits more psychological than anything  if you want blood and gore try the collector or one of the saw series
Aug 2 2009,positive,not meant for mainstream hollywood but with an absence of special effects or a high budget this film will make you leap out of your skin more than most modern horror movies watch in the dark less people around the better
Aug 2 2009,positive,this actually scared me when i was little lol
Aug 1 2009,positive,i think they mightve gotten the cast wrong  from other things ive seen about this movie  linda blair  little girl from exorcist  played heather in this movie
Jul 30 2009,positive,i know stupid people who believed this movie was the real deal  lol
Jul 29 2009,positive,took me a while to get around to seeing this wasnt expecting much but gotta admit i kinda liked it
Jul 29 2009,positive,so the first time i watched this movie was with my dad back in 2000 and he not only hates horror he hates movies where nothing happens so watching it with him the first time was really ridiculous i could tell he hated it even at the end when he yelled what the hell was that a witch ah bullshit so a few years went by and i went back to it on my own and damn i missed a lot really what makes this movie work so well is the stories the townspeople tell at the beginning stories of kids in the woods being killed a rescue team being killed witches coming out of the water and the creepy old lady in the trailer well it turns out shes sort of the most important character in the movie the reason it all works is that every time something happens to the characters even though you dont see it you think about all the things it could be is it the witch is it some possessed town crazy is it ghosts you just dont know and your mind runs wild the scene in the tent when the children start laughing outside is unforgettable and the ending despite what my dad yelled 12 years ago is not bullshit its scary as hell
Jul 28 2009,positive,great film it freaked me out and i dont get spooked easily
Jul 28 2009,negative,very overrated but a bit frightening
Jul 24 2009,positive,i was one of those who believed this was a true story when i saw it it was frightening for sure
Jul 21 2009,negative,kinda frustrating firstly with the constant camera movements and then the constant wait for something really scary to happen i did get scared towards the end but just a little bit so its not one of the best horror movies out there
Jul 21 2009,negative,didnt see the point kept waiting for it to get good left disapointed and wanting my money back
Jul 21 2009,positive,i still love this flick even after 10 years
Jul 20 2009,positive,the story was real gud but needs work on da horror
Jul 19 2009,positive,best horror movie ive seen in a long time
Jul 19 2009,positive,this film was and still is the scariest and most chilling ive ever seen when i saw it in the cinema 10 years ago i was so scared i made my mate walk me home and i had to sleep with the light on it freaked me out so much and watching it again last night not so scared admittedly but i still found it very disturbing the scenes in pitch black darkness with just the odd  scream or branch being broken are overwhelming and builds the tension incredibly superb bit of filmmaking and a genius marketing campaign too
Jul 18 2009,positive,this one of the best horror movies ever made and certainly one of my favorite movies of all time this movie has major positives but two real drawbacks    first the shaky camera didnt really do much for me and i am not a huge fan of films that use that second the acting was second rate at best nothing special and in some moments very cheesy with this in mind however this film does some really incredible things    first off there are very few characters which is a good thing because you grow more attached to a smaller number so that way when something happens to one of them it has more of an impact second the mood and the environment of this film is very creepy the random structures and things found out in the middle of the woods is creepy and not something i would ever want to encounter next is the use of the dark and lack of lighting really the audience can only see what the characters can see and in the dark this makes the film very terrifying humans are naturally put off by the dark and in most films it is dark but the audience can still see what is going on this you cannot leaving the imagination to run wild producing a scarier movie with the imagination in mind the other thing this movie does is that it never showed the audience the monster this is very important because in all horror movies when the monster is shown it really is no longer scary because we can see it we can see what it actually is and rationalize it fear is inherently irrational and so in order to exploit this the movie must allow the imagination to run wild making the audience wonder what is out there allows them to imagine what it is and usually that would mean something frightening to that individual so it strikes a different core with each individual viewer also this film has many elements of suspense most occurring at night and many of them very scary and unusual and even in the daylight it doesnt feel completely safe    this movie is adamantly scary which is really unusual for a movie especially now being that audiences are exposed to so much of the same trust me this movie will make you second guess going hiking or backpacking in the woods after you watch it if you havent seen this movie you need to this is one of the greats
Jul 17 2009,negative,totally ludacris very hard to be taken seriously overall give it a 5100
Jul 17 2009,positive,they got me  this is the first movie to scare me since i was 7years old seeing poltergeist 
Jul 16 2009,negative,utter waste of time praise to the film makers for conning us out of our hard earned dollars
Jul 16 2009,negative,i think this movie didnt live up to the expectations too much hyped
Jul 15 2009,positive,if your going campingdont see this one
Jul 15 2009,negative,i hate this movie  cant understand how it ever became a hitshakey camerascreams in the woodsi can do thatnext time i see 3 guys  a girl in the woods i hope its a porno
Jul 14 2009,positive,really good for its times a bit lame now
Jul 13 2009,positive,amazing awesome really scary wish i would have watched it in the theater and didnt know anything about it it would have made it even that much better
Jul 12 2009,negative,a month before this was released i was visiting some film industry friends in la they showed me the advance copy exactly like the theatrical version and told me it was all real it didnt scare me in any way my friends were disappointed when i announced that i thought it was a big hoax and i was disappointed in the general populace who made such a big deal about it
Jul 12 2009,positive,the blair witch project is a landmark of the horror thriller genre after all of the slasher movies of the 80s got old when we all got sick of seeing chucky when freddy and jason finally got old and the same formula became played out along comes the bwp this movie is something truly unique and different as it slammed the audience with pure realism in documentary style shooting the actors become a bit annoying after only about 20 min into the film but overall it is something different from the run of the mill psycho killer flicks the eerie woods of maryland quickly become a character itself the creep factor truly rises when night falls and the weird shit starts happening the movie does take a min to get going but after about 30 min into the movie it starts to become clear that this is actually a good creepfest as a fan of horror i honorably give 4 stars to the bwp for sheer creativity fresh ideas and an absolutely fresh new take on the whole creepy woods bit check it out sometime and see what you think
Jul 9 2009,positive,admit it it scared you when you were a kid
Jul 9 2009,positive,sort of scary but still a good movie to watch
Jul 7 2009,positive,entertaining especially if you watch it right before you go camping
Jul 7 2009,positive,one of the first pseudodocumentaries in the horror genre and it worked people actually believed it was real
Jul 6 2009,neutral,im sure if you saw this before it was revealed that the footage wasnt realthan it scared the pants off you  but i saw it when i was 11 just a little bit after they told everyone that they were just kidding and it was fake  i wasnt scared one bit by it  the girl who famously says how scared she is annoyed me from start to finish and some of the plot twists like losing the map were just plain stupid
Jul 5 2009,positive,i got to see this film when i was in high school so scary imagine your self being lost in the forest and someone you didnt even see and know try to kill you and your friends whose with you and finally you will learn that one of your friend is the killer this horror classic film was sooo remarkable
Jul 5 2009,positive,i watched this for the first time when i went on a ride to wisconsin the other day to get fireworks with the family    i thought it was one of the scarestcreepiest things ever the three ended up dying mike heather and josh all went to black hills forest filiming a documentary about the blair witch they got stranded in the woods because thir friend mike kicked the map into the river one night because it was like reading a foreign language to him they head east for miles on end and josh is taken hes killed  heather and josh continue to try and find the car while looking for josh  they come across a house one night after hearing joshs last screams   the blair witch makes mike standin in the corner while he kills heather then mike  the documentary wasnt found for at least a year after the murders  it was very scary weird creepy and funnyonly because of some of the things they saiddid to each other to watch  i very much enjoyed this movie and im completely terrified of the black hills forest
Jul 5 2009,positive,i thought it as true very scary
Jul 4 2009,positive,fairly inventive when i look back on it
Jul 3 2009,negative,nick i want my hour and 15 minutes backnow   the movie start off boring and just as i feel that in being sucked it ends and it was terible   jack all i knew by the end of the film was that i seriously wanted all the characters to die it only built us up when one of them went missing and the real footage of the house all we know about the plot was there was something in the woods it was terrible and i would rather have spent that hour and 15 minutes ironing each of my fingers indevidually this was worse than freddies knightmarethe tv series  chrisdaniel myrick and eduardo s√°nchez owe me at least an hour of my life back   most of this film was more boring than sitting through a six hour talk about the history of thimbles by nickleback my friend fell asleep this film was more mediocre than my life the last 20 mins build up to a scary climax that did not occurit was bad wooooooooo
Jul 2 2009,positive,terrifying psychological horror film that blurs the line between reality and fiction using documentary style technique fused with a homemovie sensibility  eschewing traditional film narrative form the movie works because it makes the viewer part of the terror stalking the three student filmmakers who get lost in the backwoods while making a documentary about the fabled blair witch  the jerks of the camera the lack of light the utterly real feeling of isolation fear and ultimately terror of the undefined makes this one of the finest horror pictures ever  in the end it truly fucks you in the head
Jul 1 2009,positive,i didnt see this until 2005 and watching it late at night alone it actually did scare me
Jul 1 2009,positive,not been a film like it since top notch
Jul 1 2009,positive,didnt like the shaky camera shots
Jun 30 2009,negative,really freaky but not very good id cover my eyes cause i thought something scary would happen but nothing did just suspenseful eh
Jun 30 2009,neutral,i loved it the 1st time  the second no so much
Jun 30 2009,positive,this was so scary that it was sexy
Jun 29 2009,negative,i had a russian babysitter that took me to see this terrrible
Jun 27 2009,positive,a truly claustrophobic and shocking movie
Jun 23 2009,negative,can i give this a negative ratingwhat a steaming pile of 
Jun 23 2009,positive,seems like it was inspired by cannibal holocaust this decides to take a less is more approach and it works quite well in some places this film actually manages to be quite tense and creepy with quite an interesting ending unfortunately the main characters were quite annoying especially heather but that aside this is a masterclass in low budget horror not bad
Jun 22 2009,positive,great for what it is  a gimmick  but then what massively successful movies arent largely gimmickry
Jun 22 2009,negative,anyone that ever beliived that this film was based on true events probably still believes in the easter bunny
Jun 21 2009,positive,the ending freaks me out  it was a good idea when it was made
Jun 21 2009,positive,really great movie but i was diappointed at the end
Jun 21 2009,neutral,thought it was real
Jun 21 2009,neutral,i admit this film freaked me out the first time i saw it mostly because my stomach was turning from all the bumpy handheld camera work
Jun 21 2009,negative,this truly scared me back in the daynot sure if i could sit through it now though
Jun 21 2009,positive,this is definately a hit or miss for people its kinda love it or hate it  i myself thought it was great and would really encourage people to see it  aslong as you have a reasonable imagination and dont get too woosy watching hand held camera filming you should really get a kick out of the story  the way that the movie has been made is also masterful minimal production costs with maximum effect  at only about an hour and 20 mins its not going to take up much of your time so watch it
Jun 20 2009,positive,not really scary until you think about it later in bed at nigh alone in the dark it is definatly a psychological thriller not a horror movie i  really liked it i spent way too long trying to figure out the stones and bible refferences if anyone knows what it means let me know please
Jun 20 2009,positive,this is the perfect example of how to exploit a simple idea with a minuscule budget and turn it into a national phenomenon  this film thrives on its own subtlety withholding any objective visual scare in favour of a terrifying atmosphere and growing sense of dread  the acting is decent and everything feels very natural particularly in the later portions of the film when the characters become more and more agitated and desperate  to be honest i would have liked to see something at the end even if it could have been just the shadow of a figure on the wall or something  but even this minor payoff is withheld as the filmmakers instead decide to leave everything completely open to your imagination  i would call this film a work of genius considering the the simplicity of the content itself and the impact it had on society and even though you probably wont watch it for years at a time its definitely still unique and terrifying in its own way
Jun 19 2009,negative,meh  i can appreciate the idea but it just never got scary  even at the end i was mostly annoyed at not having a clearer picture
Jun 19 2009,positive,a true incident in form of documentary straight from the victims handy cam it was hell lot of scary i never thought such things could be documented and the film threw shiver down my spine     may the victims rest in peace    ps  please dont watch this at night
Jun 17 2009,negative,personally i didnt get it they walk around  a forest in ciricles and film it
Jun 15 2009,negative,a really big let down its very overrated it wasnt even scary it was like a cheap home made horror movie that a 13 year old made the ending made no sense avoid this garbage it was very boring
Jun 15 2009,positive,beginning was  irritating and the did not pronounce healthilynot possible to understand without subtitlesmovie was overall goodwith not a single shadow of any ghost or monsterindian movie should learn how to make this type effective of presentation
Jun 15 2009,positive,dont stand in that corner
Jun 15 2009,negative,how could anyone be scared of this shitty handy cam filming poor acting and one weakass story make this one majorly overrated piece of crap
Jun 14 2009,negative,i was unimpressed with this movie
Jun 13 2009,negative,no dont do it this movie is totally wothless

Jun 11 2009,negative,it was way scarier when i was 10 rewatching the actors do a great job of capturing nothing in particular minus some great shots of trees and their own faces in the dark nowhere close to the masterpiece it was said to be
Jun 11 2009,positive,this a very creative idea for a movie i give that some awesome props aka brownie points
Jun 11 2009,positive,this is one of those rare movies that actually gets my heart pounding in my chest i love how it shows us nothing and leaves everything up to the viewers imagination the shaky cams and total darkness work so well nothing seems unbelievable a truly terrifying movie
Jun 11 2009,negative,the promotion was geniusbut id say that i only liked the last 2 shots of the entire movie
Jun 10 2009,positive,the orginal hand held movie
Jun 10 2009,positive,very clever low budget makes it gritty and real the girl is so annoying but it helps draw you in and become involved top suspense too
Jun 9 2009,positive,admit it before the kids started going on talk shows and ruined the concept of found lost footage this movie freaked you out
Jun 9 2009,positive,no horror film has ever been shot like this up until now a masterpeice idea for a spin chilling tale of terror  shot to make the film look like a home video it puts you right into the story at the deep end edge of your seat stuff that leaves the hairs on the back on end for days a must see for all horror fans
Jun 8 2009,negative,somebody explain to me how this was scary if you think this was scary just find some woods even if you can see your house from them and just walk through them at night
Jun 8 2009,negative,when this movie came out it was a hit i dont know why it was a waiste of time they build up suspense for no reason
Jun 7 2009,positive,the less is more thing really works in this film

Jun 6 2009,positive,after 13 years of the release i finally take a look at it and i just loved every minute of it it doesnt have much going on but there is a certain feel to it that just makes you want to watch it until the very end enjoyable i will probably watch it again in the near future
Jun 6 2009,negative,if these people were really scared they are a bunch of wusses
Jun 5 2009,positive,frighteningly realistic  it sucks you in and doesnt let go  it moves at a breakneck pace so youre never bored  makes me never want to be alone in the woodsor outside at night for that matter  the ending creeped me out to no end  i still get chills just thinking about it
Jun 5 2009,positive,i was so scared after thisand i havent spend a night in tent after that
Jun 4 2009,positive,an impressive way to show that you dont always need to show blood brutal murders heavy makeups and special effects to create a thriller movie 
Jun 4 2009,negative,i felt it was more of a comedy but i saw it way after people were making such a big deal outta it
Jun 3 2009,positive,watching this one alone at home at 2am really helps i think it takes some willingness to get sucked in im not afraid to admit it i was impressed with this one only two or three movies ever have managed to actually creep me out and this is one of them the ending was perfect
Jun 2 2009,negative,i heard there is a massive lawsuit by the public they want 2 hours of their life back
Jun 1 2009,positive,please check out curse of the blair witch over all a good idea but the movie was the worst part
Jun 1 2009,positive,this is really a very scary film in its presentation and mystery  it feels very real and draws you in as if you are involved on the trip yourself
Jun 1 2009,positive,seeing it in the cinema not knowing what to expect was great  is it a wonderful film no but its like a barnum and bailey curiosity  there doesnt have to be  a point
Jun 1 2009,positive,a gritty and intense horror film that made a big wave toward the genre
May 29 2009,positive,not as good or as bad as everyone said it was
May 28 2009,positive,maybe the last time i was actually scared in a movie theater
May 28 2009,positive,the blair witch project has lost its horror aspect due not to the film but to many parodies however i feel the film is still a great genre piece that has its place in history and will not be soon forgotten
May 28 2009,positive,i dont get the ending
May 27 2009,negative,its not scary enough to be a thriller looks like an unfinished movie rather than a thriller all i remember is tears and mucus dropping out of her nose
May 26 2009,negative,the worst movie eve made
May 26 2009,positive,so scary but i wish you knew what happened at the end
May 25 2009,positive,greatest horror movie ever made
May 25 2009,positive,heather donahue michael williams and joshua leonard student filmmakers set out to shoot a documentary about a local legend the blair witch in the forests near burkittsville maryland many children have vanished in the 1940s and people still avoid going too deep into the woods so the party sets out to look for facts that prove the legend equipped only with two cameras and a little hiking gear first they find little piles of stone that must have been arranged artificially later they have to admit to be lost in the woods eerie sounds at night and more piles of stones in places where they have not been before cause the already desperate group to panic and one night days after they should have been back home josh disappears completely only what has been recorded and filmed with the cameras is found a year later and shows what happened in the woods
May 24 2009,positive,im a huge fan i love the concept i love the cinematography i love the psychology and the lowbudget vibe great creepy stuff
May 24 2009,negative,my friend and i saw two of the more anticipated movies of 1999 on the same night both opened the same day eyes wide shut and blair witch project and i dont think i could have found two better examples of the opposite extremes of filmmaking blair witch for all its hype at the time was disappointing and even insulting at times granted the core performances are very convincing however much of what they do doesnt make any sense at all the films key distinction is essentially that it looks bad with lots of handjerky motions which only serve to make one dizzy there is little real story to the movie and suffice to say the movie feels improvised and off the cuff and subsequently amateurish the only fascinating aspect to this movie is how in the world it could have generated so much hype as it did i still remember how the theater we went to was a packed house while the ews was only half full both were goodsized theaters i honestly dont know how such a badlyfilmed inconsequential film could steal thunder from the genius of kubrick blair witch commits the worst crime for a horror film it doesnt scare it doesnt even tease us with a scare its just boring for all those critics who compared it with the exorcist i can only imagine they meant exorcist ii as time goes on i think ews will be remembered while bwp will be long forgotten
May 24 2009,positive,its such a creepy story this movie was so wellmade and kinda realistic that i almost started believing in the existence of witchcraft there are some scenes in the movie that freaked me out
May 23 2009,positive,this has got to be the scariest movie i have ever seen so realistic so dark i had to turn the light on because i almost crapped my pants recommended for anybody without a squeamish stomach
May 23 2009,positive,still the one film that disturbs me the most
May 21 2009,positive,screw it i was scared
May 21 2009,positive,i think its a great movie for the first of its kind

May 11 2009,positive,classic   live terrifying experience  with a brilliant concept low budget movie wins over audiences    but until the end what the hell is going
May 10 2009,negative,10th may 2009 nearly 10 years after its release and i finally watch the blair with project this film was very much hyped in 99 but it really isnt that scary there are moments of suspense and creepiness but overall it falls flat i was sitting their all film waiting for some big scary as anything ending for nothing to actually happen credit to the sound mix though which is one of the more effective parts of the film the problem is that the characters are just annoying as hell and so dumb you just dont care anything for them and in fact want them to perish so you dont have to listen to their whining
May 9 2009,positive,after 10 years im still scared by this movie this one rewrote the rules of production of genre even marketing respect it
May 9 2009,negative,selective disturbing somewhat of a classic but something that needs to be experienced atleast once the fact that it wasnt real even when people and tv hyped to be real and it wasnt was a bummer but the ending was ok
May 9 2009,negative,i sawthe blair witch project when it was showing on tele with the hope that it would scare the hell out of my me not only was bwp very unprofessional some people say that was one of its advantages but i really dont think so but it wasnt scary at all i nearly fell asleep watching it really for 80 minutes i thought that the scary part was coming up and then it ended hugely disappointing
May 8 2009,positive,at the first instance i saw its promotional trailer i thought it was real so i grab the knob and closed it go to my favorite theatre and watch it the story spreads widely and everyone watched it the film is quite convincing and the style called cinema verite is done effectively thus bringing the emotional and psychological thrill to every viewer a great milestone for movies
May 8 2009,positive,a very inventive and smart modern horror film unlike the crappy saw movie series
May 8 2009,negative,i thought this was absolutly terrible i finally saw it because its a classic notice how there are quotations around the word classici was very dissapointedi think the idea for this film was a great one but it was not well done at alli do not recommend thisthe only well done part was the very end
May 8 2009,negative,thanks for introducing us to shitty cinematography    oh and anticlimactic endings
May 8 2009,negative,one of the most boring films i have ever seenit drags on and on and doesnt even have an ending
May 7 2009,negative,im only giving it a half star cuz the ending sucked so bad and the sniffling chick that you just wanted to smack

May 5 2009,neutral,very well done pretty disturbing film because the way it was filmed complete new way of making a low budget movie
May 4 2009,negative,nothing scary about it
May 2 2009,positive,the movie as a whole was lame but some pieces were surprising and scraythe end freaked me out and therfore i have to give it ahigher rating
May 2 2009,positive,a great and creepy flick that i could have made it in my backyard
May 2 2009,negative,looks good because of the handheld camera approach which gives the movie a more real feeling to it but this movie is awfully boring even a glossy hollywood horror movie has given me more frights than this
May 1 2009,negative,the best part of this movie was the fact that heidi scared herself thinking we were going to scare her after watching it
May 1 2009,negative,i just got a headache
May 1 2009,positive,i actually though this was very scary it sort of creeps up on you and before you know it you are clutching at whatever pillow is within reach it takes a lot of time to build up atmosphere which is where the true horror lies something that a lot of modern american horror movies could learn a lot from
May 1 2009,positive,a brave try at such lowbugdet minimalist film although it holds no actual horror at all it does hype me up those who find cloverfield likable should also watch this
May 1 2009,positive,h8 it worst film i ever watched scaried my sooo much neva watching again but great if you want a scare 
Apr 30 2009,negative,retarded i kinda hated it i culd care less if it was real

Apr 28 2009,neutral,it is original and nicely  shot but so unbelievably boring not scary and a waste of time
Apr 27 2009,positive,this being a truetolife documentation made this film even more thrilling and scary youll just hate how the camera moves alot
Apr 26 2009,negative,utter nonscary toss how this achieved its legendary status gawd only knows
Apr 25 2009,positive,would have been a better movie if the shaky camera work hadnt given me motion sickness
Apr 25 2009,positive,cut em some slack  genius concept a la cannibal holocaust that resulted in 10k for every dollar spent in return  suspend some disbelief let your imagination run wild and get a lil bit scurred
Apr 24 2009,negative,boooooring i almost fell asleep not scary at all and hell yeah  boring and the hand held shaking camera  give me a break
Apr 22 2009,neutral,it does a good job of hyping you up but i just found the end to be disappointing  i can understand why they did it i just didnt really like it  still was a really good idea and there were parts that i definitely liked  not really scary though  let down
Apr 22 2009,negative,grotesquely overhyped horror pic an exercise in lowbudget minimalism tries to pull a fast onefilms absolutely nothing for 87 minutes if you have a fear of loud screaming and fast running youll have nightmares for weeksbut the rest of the gags are halfassed no matter how much we employ the lowestcommondenominator horror theory pretentious filmmakers think theyre clever but im thoroughly unpersuaded who knows who cares
Apr 21 2009,positive,whats all the hype about it was a good idea stop
Apr 21 2009,positive,other than jaws the blair witch project is the most effective horror movie i have seen to date if i had seen it when it came out i would have thought it was real its just that good
Apr 19 2009,positive,chances are you wont forget this hairraising film it has an effective and psychological plot and is constructed very well

Apr 14 2009,negative,worst horror movie ive ever seen incredibly boring
Apr 14 2009,positive,the thing about this movie that is scary is that fact that you dont see the witch but you know its out there stalking you and watching you that is scary
Apr 14 2009,negative,its because of twats like this that we got cloverfield and other pos projects to let some untalented bimbo run around making audiences puke and get headaches while she cries and bitches into a camera brafuckingo
Apr 13 2009,negative,i am so sorry that i watched it
Apr 11 2009,negative,seriously sucked

Apr 11 2009,positive,a pioneering effort in the world of horror movies     i dont think so although the film was impressive and certaintly creepy in places the man in the corner the bundle of blood and weird circle of sticks    good film i didnt get sick due to camera movement its a film not a roller coaster
Apr 10 2009,positive,this is amazing  its one of my top 5
Apr 10 2009,negative,absolute shite  glad i never wasted my money at the cinema

Apr 9 2009,positive,so into horror movies
Apr 8 2009,negative,i think the f bomb every other word was a bit ridiculousnothing too scary about this movie
Apr 8 2009,negative,i saw it for my first time and all it was is whining bickering and thats about it it was not scary just obnoxious the only reason people found it scarry was because they thought it was for real later they all found out the filmmakers were full of shit the film had amazing marketing that ill say other than that it was crap i could make this movie its worth watch because it was a big film in our pop culture but thats about it
Apr 8 2009,positive,the f bomb gets droped alot
Apr 8 2009,negative,yeah so i fell asleep watching this
Apr 8 2009,positive,well done and innovative  could have done wo all the language
Apr 7 2009,negative,everybody was obsessed with this movie and i dont really know why
Apr 7 2009,negative,i live not to far from here and even i didnt like this movie  give me a break
Apr 7 2009,negative,one of the most overrated movies ever
Apr 6 2009,positive,dont know whats going to happen next
Apr 6 2009,negative,highly overrated more boring than terrifying
Apr 5 2009,positive,while we know its just a film the methods of filmmaking and the full commitment of the actors go as far as films can go at tricking us completely involved and genuinely creepy the films only real criticism is the reality of the actors continuing to film
Apr 5 2009,positive,scary as when ur by urself
Apr 4 2009,negative,what a load of crap this film is  any movie that i can film in my backyard should not be a feature length film  this movie is made up of shaky cameras and cussing  seriously that is seemingly the entire plot
Apr 4 2009,negative,so i could only give this movie a star and a half because it was mostly crap but i saw the second movie first and i only gave that one a half star so this film was actually a huge success compared to other one some of my friends were actually scared while watching this so i give the film makers credit for being able to scare a few people
Apr 3 2009,negative,it suck dont watch it
Apr 3 2009,negative,got so bored that i didnt even finish watching it
Apr 3 2009,positive,the 1st time i saw this was at 1 in the morning with a buzz onso yes it did scare me a bit
Apr 3 2009,negative,terrible film and not as cheap as people made out at the time of its release it had the largest advertising spend ever just to reiterate terrible film made popular by virtue of the largest advertising budget ever cynical
Apr 2 2009,positive,returned to this years after the hype unexpectedly good film but i still find myself rooting for ms witch
Apr 2 2009,positive,good but at the end of the day nalt happens good ending though
Apr 2 2009,positive,say what you will one of the greatest marketing campaigns in history for a film with one of the biggest box office ratios ever it was made for cheap as shit the blair witch project was an intense film people bitch about not seeing the witch in the movie but i still enjoy watching this
Apr 1 2009,negative,not worth seeing thats it a joke
Apr 1 2009,negative,probably the funniest movie ive ever seen if you think this is scary do me a favor watch it with at least 2 other people with lights on and i gauruntee that you will come out laughing at about every other thrill this is in no way a horror movie because nothing happens no one dies on or offscreen and these three dumb college kids are stuck in the maryland forest really maryland forest thats about 2040 miles of forestland how on earth do you get lost in this amount of forest alas i cannot express enough how much i hate this movie it has no room existing the end
Apr 1 2009,positive,this movie is scary is evertwo coffee mugs up even though i didnt understand the ending
Mar 31 2009,positive,you can only bow to the success  budget ratio  id say it deserved it well i only saw it ten years ago but i remember it being freaky  
Mar 31 2009,negative,this goes in my napoleon dynacrap catagory
Mar 31 2009,positive,at the time seemed very original and different amazing how uninteresting it was on a revisit several years later
Mar 30 2009,positive,a genuinely shocking film if you are a person who actually goes out camping in the middle of the woods you will get what is scary about this it is an atmospheric horror movie rather than a situational horror movie the situation slowly builds but it is the building sense of hopelessness and progressively more supernatural events that is meant to get you it was filmed in a completely unique way and im not talking about the handheld camera work do a little research if you have no idea what im talking about which was actually first seen in the lost forgotten and in some places banned movie cannibal holocaust
Mar 30 2009,positive,im going to have to say i was very disappointed with this movie it has been hyped up and everyone says how amazing it is and some aspects that i enjoyed are   1 the acting  2 the ending  3 the direction  4 the lighting   5 the sets  6 the costumes  7 the linesscript    the reason this movie only made it to an average rating in my book is the plot the first hour of the movie has some information that is important to the movie but for the most part its just fighting and cussing its almost pointless the last half after the first hour had more substance and a better plot line the things that happened in the last half were tense and akwardly terrifing the whole movie has a bit of terror too it because being lost and scared is real but what makes this movie better is whats happening the things you acnt explain and the fact that your following them and feelings and seeing what their feeling     heather donahue she was great each character played a role with the same name as themselves and her performances dripped of realism she was full blown amazing and had real conviction her performances was realistic and she made me believe every second of the movie her screams she could put jamie lee curtis to shame d    joshua leonard he was a tie with mike for my favorite character he did a wonderful job of acting he was a totaly real and indivdiual character his lines seemed real and his body language was just so realistic he was so emotionally ranged     mike williams his character was a very different type of character becase he had a strong willed and terrified character his emotional range was more than perfect he was my favorite character the ending was perfect and he was great he is so meant for films    this movie was a wonderful besides the lack of plot during the daytime scenes     rated r for  small amounts of gore pg13 amounts  language like 130 fwords and all the other lesser but still pg13 style words
Mar 30 2009,negative,i have to imagine this film was meant to be seen on a big screen because on dvd it borders on incoherent  screaming at nothing needless shaking of the camera constant reference to the camera its almost like they were too in love with the idea of the film to actually make the film
Mar 30 2009,negative,in 1999 two young filmmakers scared the living daylights of moviegoers with a horror film unlike any other daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez shot the blair witch project with the tiniest of film budgets and released the film in one of the most bizarre marketing campaigns ever propelling the independent film to a remarkable boxoffice success this is what happened    in 1994 three student filmmakers heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams decided to make a documentary that explored the local legend of the blair witch they hiked into marylands black hills forest with cameras and were never heard of again one year later their footage was found and pieced together by myrick and sanchez the blair witch project became their legacy because of the nature of the film and the mystery of its marketing the film is thought to be a true video recording of what happened during that fateful hike    unlike other more conventional forms of horror the blair witch project does not hold up well after a decade this is because as it ages it gets less appealing with the accessibility of digital cameras and video technology anyone can make such a film post it on you tube and get either instant gratification or immediate disparagement yes it is probably the most innovative horror innovation since john carpenter√¢s halloween 1978 but the blair witch project has over the years lost its ability to deceive and scare viewers    shot with two unsteady handheld cameras one in color the other in blackandwhite the blair witch project was the original inspiration for matt reeves cloverfield 2008 this technique gives viewers a nauseating stomachchurning feeling throughout something which i admired in cloverfield but detested in the blair witch project at least the former was entertaining but that cannot be said of the latter which is an example of execrable filmmaking at its finest    there is an absence of depth and substance in the blair witch project yes one can argue that it is in the nature of such a film which makes it not require any kind of depth and substance however to categorize something as film there needs to be a degree of professionalism to how it is being done characters and the narrative must be adequately developed the blair witch project exhibits near emptiness it is an amateurish longdrawn video clip that in my opinion has one of the lowest scare quotients for a horror flick    the film will appear creepy to most as it plays on our fears of the unknown it builds tension through silence which is occasionally punctuated by strange sounds and the use of darkness adds to the eeriness yet the most chilling scene happens in the day when the trio discovers humanlike impressions made using leaves and twigs and hung using nettings and ropes but for the rest of the film i wish to say i wanted to be scared but i couldn√¢t    score 2510    all rights reserved
Mar 29 2009,negative,poorexcruciating to the eyesnever would recommend to anyone on gods green earth
Mar 29 2009,positive,intense and original blair witch is a very welcome surprise the entire film was shot by the three actors who were indeed dumped in the woods for a week with a very barebones script that called for lots of improvisation limited access to the directors and complete isolation results in damned great and convincing acting this may just be the most original film i have ever seen and its excellent filmmakers and horror lovers will thrive on the blair witch project and i defiantly recommend it to anyone else seeking something wholly unconventional
Mar 28 2009,positive,right before it came out there was a big media marketing push claiming it was very real i saw made for tv documentaries and read news articles about the disappearance of these three teens  i bought it  the movie scared the everloving buhjeezus out of me then i found out that it was all a hoax to sell tickets i didnt care i still had a terrifying roller coaster ride
Mar 28 2009,negative,rip off of cannibal holocaust skip this movie
Mar 27 2009,positive,i dont know why people dont like this movie it was cool it makes you think and its not a fuckin film its real
Mar 27 2009,negative,an idea  not a movie
Mar 26 2009,positive,im its only fan haha

Mar 26 2009,positive,great acting setting and freaky ending even the open woods can feel confining
Mar 26 2009,neutral,amusing when it came out although i dont think it was supposed to be funny
Mar 26 2009,positive,at the time this movie was genuinely disturbing in a snufffilm kind of way
Mar 25 2009,negative,i thought it was gonna be a fantastic fright fest i was sorely mistaken it was a big pile of poop
Mar 25 2009,positive,ugh as much as i want to give it 1 star they did create quite the buzz
Mar 24 2009,positive,tough to sit through with the filming style
Mar 24 2009,positive,ha good to see that caused such impact but did you know all was improvised and good story behind it
Mar 24 2009,neutral,this movie makes me barf
Mar 24 2009,negative,the best part was the lady talking about the horse thing
Mar 23 2009,positive,i dont want to say this is the scariest movie ever because movie dont scare me but this is one of the movies that has most effectively spooked me the fuck out
Mar 23 2009,positive,three students filmed a documentary about a local legend  called blair   witch after that the 3 never came back but their videos was seen a year later
Mar 23 2009,positive,the surprise hit of 1999 the blair witch project drew audiences in with an incredibly astute and innovative marketing campaign which blurred the lines between fact and fiction masquerading as found footage directors eduardo sanchez and daniel myrick devised a fairly genius formula which has since been done to death the imdb credits for the principle actors were listed as missing presumed dead while sanchez and myrick pasted up missing posters for them at the cannes film festival people genuinely believed the blair witch project was real which all led to it becoming the most profitable film of all time 22000 budget to a 240 million gross even watching it today now all the hoopla has died down it still holds up remarkably well its atmospheric tense and does so much with so little it expertly and slowly builds up its premise and situation never going for easy scares while creating a genuinly unsettling atmosphere its the kind of film that can only be done once the kind of film that captures a moment so expertly that it cant be replicated the blair witch project is an abject lesson in how to market a small independent film so that it can hang with the big boys as well as that its also flipping scary
Mar 23 2009,positive,no fucking redneck is this creative 
Mar 22 2009,positive,spoiler alert cool premise and very good execution creepy and frightening great job hiding the fact that the movie was a hoax for several months its crapyourpants scary as a true story but it still holds up as a good fictional horror flick
Mar 22 2009,positive,good for what it is
Mar 21 2009,positive,not just a movie but also a phenomenon amazing backround work with the marketing greatness
Mar 21 2009,positive,this movie keeps you on guard the entire time just brilliant
Mar 20 2009,positive,one of the scariest movies ive personally ever seen and to this day a year or two after seeing it reminiscing about it still chills me to the core
Mar 20 2009,positive,thought it was real until it was beep fake
Mar 19 2009,positive,this movie was weird i also got sick at the end because the camera was so shakey it made me throw up
Mar 19 2009,negative,lol at motion sickness from poor camera footage
Mar 19 2009,negative,ugh i remember watching this a long time ago and before watching it thinking oh this is going to be great now i wished i had never seen this pile of crap sorry dont know how anyone found this movie scary it was extremely boring and i kept looking at my watch
Mar 18 2009,positive,i really got the tension and the thrilldamn
Mar 17 2009,positive,i had never seen this wow  very cool concept slick direction  about as scaled down and minimal as can be  creepy the way a ghost story around a camp fire is loved the ending
Mar 17 2009,negative,dont ever ever ever ever ever watch this
Mar 16 2009,negative,sucked ass to me anyways
Mar 15 2009,negative,only if i can rate negative i would it was such a hype i was suckered into watching it the first day it came out i left the theatre almost wanting to throw up from the camera jittering
Mar 14 2009,positive,it is a rare and somewhat pleasant occasion when a film allows the viewer to leave the  to his or her imagination the blair witch project is one of these rare occasions its clever and unprecedented cinematography is nothing short of brilliant with footage as raw as its budget the film can make even the bravest of movie goers motion sick its realism is what makes it frightening from the honesty of the actors to the shrill piercing screams of heather donahue never in my life have i seen an actress so realistically share her fear with the audience seeing the impenetrable fear in her eyes as she makes her final confessions heather brings us into the woods and takes us on a journey into our wild imaginations
Mar 14 2009,negative,this movie sucked since it made me sick and it took too long to kill everyone
Mar 14 2009,positive,the film is a classic example of a movie gettin lots of attention for nothing  everyone would admit it is nowhere near a half decent movie but it did good business coz of the endless discussion around it i would rate it among the biggest anticlimaxes of all times  more often than not u wud hate it but u must watch it for the heck of it
Mar 14 2009,negative,amazing what pure hype can do for a films profits
Mar 12 2009,negative,i used to be frightened to death of my basement because of this movie for that it fails
Mar 12 2009,positive,ohhh my gosh this is my fave  way back years ago
Mar 12 2009,positive,ok this movie scared the holy crap outta meso much so after seeing it at the thearte at the midnight show i was scared driving thru the woods to my parents house that night
Mar 11 2009,positive,this was scary in middle of the night d
Mar 10 2009,positive,pretty creepyim such a wimp lol the documentary style of filming is amazingmakes you feel like all thescary stuff is more real
Mar 10 2009,positive,interesting low budget film proves that with a little imagination and fortitude a film maker can do lot that pays off in this case  big time
Mar 10 2009,negative,i hate this film its simply not scary or even that interesting that much the only good part was the last two minutes why couldnt the whole film have that effect
Mar 10 2009,positive,u will either love or hate this due to the nature of the filming personally i like the way it leaves everything to the imagination making it psychologically far scarier than any hockey masked knife wielding lunatic
Mar 9 2009,positive,the film itself is probably only 3stars but in context of the everything else the website the fake scifi special traveling artifact displays etc the entire experience was definitely unique
Mar 9 2009,negative,i do not get the hype
Mar 8 2009,positive,gritty wellthought of with all the marketing campaigns successfully drawing in anyone curious enough very lowbudgeted horror masterpiece that started a whole new take on the genre in terms of using firstperson pov through cameras
Mar 8 2009,positive,the little movie that did  still eerie and scary to watch
Mar 7 2009,positive,not as amazing as all the hype that surrounded it at the time but till scary
Mar 6 2009,positive,original grounbreaking horror when i first saw this i couldnt sleep after the endingleft everything to your imagination no other film has scared me as much as this although it looses its effect after the first time you see itmade on a slender budget its better than any big budget horror filmpure geniusclassic
Mar 6 2009,positive,i looooooooooooove this film 
Mar 6 2009,positive,i love it it is so nice
Mar 5 2009,positive,a true classic it has to be the scariest movie ever made
Mar 5 2009,negative,the worst movie i ever saw i watsted my money when i went to the theatre to see it would have walked out if i hand gone with someone else
Mar 5 2009,positive,i think this is genuinely stunning and the product of hard workborderline genius marketing and a fantastic premise this scared the shit out of me its a low budget gem but the end product is professional and will still be talked about in years to come  next time i go camping im keeping hold of the fucking map
Mar 4 2009,positive,the most realistic scare film in decades imagine if it was youhandheld cameras genius
Mar 3 2009,negative,all that camera shaking i had to leave the theater before i threw up seriously
Mar 3 2009,negative,practically a lullabye  i dont like scary movies
Mar 3 2009,neutral,creepiest movie ive ever seen and i barely get scared of horror movies
Mar 2 2009,negative,waste of time not scary 2 hours of listening to a bunch of jerks bitch at each other
Mar 2 2009,negative,dont every make a movie like this again
Mar 2 2009,negative,the most overhyped piece of dog shit ever not to mention 2 hours of my life that ill never get back
Mar 2 2009,positive,ive seen this film at least 10 times and as much as i try to be objective and watch it knowing in the back of my mind that its a hoax for a concept it still always draws me in  it must be the way it plays on all of our basic fears and sticks with it all the way through rather than going for the easy pay off horror shot  a great movie and still as scary if i ever find a bundle of sticks outside my tent im out of there
Mar 1 2009,positive,near perfect but entirely creepy
Mar 1 2009,positive,unusual for the time and genuinely scary but the novelty of it wears off after a while
Mar 1 2009,positive,that thing in the woods is still scary after all these years
Mar 1 2009,negative,i thought the ending was stupid
Feb 28 2009,negative,i dont get the hype about this this movie lame boring waste of time
Feb 28 2009,positive,it was coolwhen i first watched it cuz it seemed so real and the end was scarier than sht
Feb 27 2009,positive,unknown more frightening than the known yada yada really just running through the woods at night screaming that did it for me
Feb 27 2009,positive,effectively scary movie  the movie creates a great tone and advances it all the way til the end  you get the feeling of the isolation  certain things they find on the way that make you frightened as well  its almost as if your part of the movie as its filmed with the documentary style in mind you get a first person view  the end however and other pieces that could have been added made it fall short of its possible glory  you never really see anything at all which sure it lets your imagination run wild and create your own fear but with all the tension building and then realizing at the end that all you really saw where 3 kids running around the woods cursing and screaming about rocks in piles and sticksyes i wrote that becomes a letdown  it also makes you wonder if maybe there was no witch couldve been some random person maybe a bum maybe one of the 3 film students especially since spoiler one of them disappears  overall it sets a good tone with great potential but fails to actually deliver scares when you actually think about the situation
Feb 26 2009,positive,a masterpiece  such an awesome concept and i cant think of another film like it
Feb 26 2009,positive,you either love it or you hate iti love it
Feb 26 2009,positive,dont get why people think this is scary  im actually sad that i dont think the ending is scary  lol i feel like im missing out
Feb 26 2009,negative,i couldnt sit through it due to the shaky camera
Feb 26 2009,positive,dumb but brings back memories
Feb 26 2009,positive,an excellent thriller in independent film
Feb 26 2009,positive,sooo underrated
Feb 26 2009,negative,i can make a better movie than this one trust me i really can i made  which is a lot better this movie sucked so bad i cant believe it are you supposed to be scared
Feb 25 2009,positive,awesome movie a must see
Feb 25 2009,positive,i would call it more intense rather then outright scary
Feb 25 2009,positive,there is so much profanity in this movie that the dialog would be cut in half if you took it outbut i am a master at horror flicks and this one was scary
Feb 24 2009,positive,i rewatched it the other day considering i havent seen it in like 4 years and i never realized how well done it wasit really did look real
Feb 24 2009,negative,was there ever a more overhyped movie than this one  unwatchable
Feb 24 2009,positive,was it a real documentry or a flick documentry still not sure but it definitely scared the hell outta me
Feb 24 2009,negative,soeverybody freaks out over standing in the corner uh no thanks
Feb 24 2009,negative,absolutely pants was very disappointed by this film i have to say
Feb 23 2009,negative,it took me years for me to give this film a chancei had a bad feeling about this onewhats so scary about this documentary wannabeone of the most boring films i seeni can understand people thinking it was the real deal but most of the filmthese teens are lost in the woods  arguing all the timeby the time it gets to the end  hearing all these noises coming from the woodsi was bored to deathhorrible micro budget film that made so much money    
Feb 23 2009,positive,slow to start with a let down of an ending but somewhere in the middle it captures the quiet horror of the woods
Feb 22 2009,positive,hype was a bit much but this was fun at the time
Feb 22 2009,positive,way to creep me out at 8 years old
Feb 22 2009,positive,one of those movie you can see onec and that would be fine it was good but not to much replay value
Feb 22 2009,negative,could not stand this movie
Feb 22 2009,positive,pretty badass the way my dad told me he said it wasnt bad and it looked completely real i think in a way it was a unique horror flick  because quite honestly it wasnt stereotypical it didnt have a big boob chick or the asian and black guy who always end up dying or the white guy and white girl who always end up being alive  it was a situation that torn the characters apart and i wanted to see this blair witch but in reality the forest wasnt that huge
Feb 22 2009,positive,one of the scariest movies ive seennot for everyone
Feb 21 2009,positive,overexposure ruined this film had it been a smaller indie release i think that this film would be more highly regarded than it is
Feb 21 2009,positive,either you loved or hated it  obviously i loved it because it was raw and something the horror genre needed it revitalized it breathed fresh air and challenged the industry  the resultso many copycats but never as successful  in fact some of the current ghost hunting tv shows are due to this film  i only wish i would have come up with this movie
Feb 21 2009,negative,a fair movie by amuters however i know that it isnt based on real life
Feb 20 2009,negative,i hated every moment of this movie  i like many others got conned into seeing it in a theater  what a ripoff
Feb 20 2009,negative,i still feel ripped off
Feb 20 2009,positive,you love or hate this movie the marketing that went behined this thing will be talked about for years to come  i loved it it puts you in the tent with these student film makers and the pay off at the end is so creepy   they new playing on peoples imagination was their greatest strength
Feb 19 2009,positive,no too scary but times of realease was very original
Feb 19 2009,positive,honestly this is a perfect example of what i look for in a horror movie even knowing beforehand that this film was fictional i enjoyed reading some of the more humorous production notes on the movies stillactive website i just couldnt help but feel more and more scared as the film progressed it was just perfect how the tension built up and up and up until the very very end unlike most horror ventures which have their casual upanddown stabbing momentsthere is no real violence in it despite various small fistfights and one shocking and fairly unexpected image after the 23 point it clearly proves that 1stperson horror is much much more terrifying than any 3rdperson production could do it makes me want to make something similarsomeday maybe
Feb 18 2009,positive,admittedly this is not the greatest film ive ever watched when i first saw it i hadnt heard of it before my brother convinced me that this was a true story turned into a motion picture from actual footage several weeks later i saw heather donahue on jay leno and things started clicking due to my stupidity and such good memories i have to give this movie high marks
Feb 17 2009,positive,great scary ass hell movie dont know its true or falce but really good movie 
Feb 17 2009,positive,scared the hell out of me i like scary movies but this one really got to me maybe because of the fear of the unknown
Feb 17 2009,negative,a pointless hyped up load of amateur rubbish this film reaches its end before anything scary happens the americans may have fallen for it but the english asked for their money back
Feb 14 2009,neutral,its ok  the 2nd one its crappy
Feb 14 2009,positive,the single most brilliant premise for a horror film in the past 20 years the grainy video inter spliced with eerie 16mm footage makes for a truly disorienting experience the blair witch project shows possibly better than any other film that whats unseen is much scarier than what is
Feb 13 2009,negative,everything sucks the only that could have made it worse ben affleck
Feb 13 2009,positive,i squeezed myself three times into overpacked theaters to see this movie and had to sit on the floor once
Feb 13 2009,negative,this movie just pissed me off
Feb 12 2009,positive,this is a unique film the film works since its director understands that what really scares people isnt what they see but what they dont see
Feb 11 2009,negative,these kids could have been strangled with a cordless phone
Feb 11 2009,neutral,i just could not stand the shaky camera work
Feb 10 2009,positive,this was a real scarey moviemore because it seemed real than what happens in the movie
Feb 10 2009,negative,can we say waste of 2 hours
Feb 10 2009,positive,i hope this isnt the last good us horror filmnothing has come close since i did like cloverfield thoughalthough not really horror
Feb 8 2009,positive,created hype because it was made without a budget and still made it big big enough to sell out to hollywood for a sequel money hungry people using film as an excuse its akin to rape in my view  good film real snot too
Feb 8 2009,negative,dumb and not scary almost gave me motion sickness
Feb 8 2009,positive,watched it alone at night and it was way scarier than it should have been movies since this have stepped up the game especially indies and i dont consider this film to be anything very special
Feb 7 2009,negative,yet another waste of paper and film
Feb 5 2009,negative,yawnboring as hell  stupid
Feb 5 2009,negative,such a stupid movie for all the hype
Feb 5 2009,negative,this was kind of scarywhen i was 19
Feb 5 2009,negative,i watched this one on video and felt it was highly overrated and hyped
Feb 4 2009,negative,this was way overhyped and only the last couple of minutes were even remotely scary
Feb 4 2009,positive,i have to say when i watched this years ago it scared the shit out of me
Feb 4 2009,negative,honestly im glad they all died
Feb 4 2009,negative,only the marketing made this movie any good
Feb 3 2009,positive,i love psychological drama and this is the best my spine tingles every time i see the movie poster  i dont usually like hroror so this was just right for me
Feb 2 2009,positive,classic cult film love it
Feb 2 2009,negative,whoever made this film robbed a good portion of americas hard earned disposable income
Feb 2 2009,negative,1 star i give this because i hate it
Feb 2 2009,neutral,bit of a strange onerelies heavily on atmosphere created by the 3 central characters which is no bad thing i love the way the movie ends in such a way it leaves you feeling like you just took a sucker punch to the stomach
Feb 2 2009,negative,there were a couple of creepy bits but lets face it  blair witch is just the fword from start to finish
Feb 1 2009,negative,made me motion sick
Feb 1 2009,negative,there is a lack of answers and a certain statisfaction to seeing these dumb characters fall apart but ultimately it has some great ideas but i just couldnt connect to the characters and they are just making the wrong choice every step of the way and yelling at the top of their lungs the film is very much a pleaser because of what little they have but ultimately the picture is just not scary id give it a very low rental at best
Feb 1 2009,positive,that was a scary and one of a kind thriller
Jan 31 2009,positive,scary and creepy  super duper weird movie ever
Jan 31 2009,negative,ummmm they try 2 be scary but its just weird
Jan 31 2009,positive,i love the thing that it seems real and is scary at times something that most of horror movies dont do
Jan 29 2009,negative,i dont see what the fuzz is about boring movie never been so bored and do not let me start on the sequal
Jan 28 2009,positive,this movie is an origonal masterpeice that will change cinema forever this movie is creative and inventive they way the actors play off of eachothers emotions well there in the miskis of beging terrorised by something is perfect you really beging to get into the movie as you hear stories about the witch from the town people you feel like a kid around a camp fire getting told a scary story about a witch that kills little kids then as you beging to hear the noises and see the things and hear the little kids laughing you beging to feel like its not just a story anymore the ending of the movie is perfect it leaves you with the shot beging unknown but you yourself know what is about to happen its like the old horror movies its what you dont see what scares you you to as an audiance begin to lose your mind as the characters do as well because you are just as confused as they are as they walk for hours and never get any closer neither do you until the end when as there greatest fear comes true yours does as well as the movie is shot threw there eyes you become them almost so you feel what they feel this movie is perfect
Jan 28 2009,positive,fairly well crafted and atmospheric lowbudget flick which doesnt really go anywhere
Jan 28 2009,negative,sucked worse than the grudge
Jan 28 2009,negative,i really dont understand why people like this so much all i could think in the end was when was i supposed to be scared
Jan 28 2009,neutral,a lot of shaky cameras some snot some weird noises and a terrible ending
Jan 27 2009,positive,one of the scarest movies
Jan 27 2009,positive,the end really got me for some reason  at least this movie was semioriginal
Jan 26 2009,negative,had to read at skool rubbiishhhh 
Jan 26 2009,positive,this movie was made so credible and seemed so real that i actually believed that everything that was found on that tape really happened
Jan 25 2009,negative,i  saw this well part of it ages ago of course it made a ton of money on a shoestring budget so i have to give it some credit
Jan 25 2009,positive,9310    i never did get to see the blair witch project when it was originally released pity becuase it would have scared the living shit out of me as a kid blair witch proves that suggestion will always always be scarier then whatever scary thing someone decides to put on screen the film leaves you in the dark about everything and as such you know no more of the characters situation then them themselves sure the people act stupidly at times but thats another aspect that makes the events seen so much more real people will act recklessly when all hell is breaking loose around them ominous wooden figures popping up everywhere children laughing outside the tent the fact that no matter what way they go they cant seem to leave the forest its fuckin creepy blair witch is one of those few horror movies that make the dark seem a little bit deeper and menacing even after its ended
Jan 25 2009,positive,i love this film for many reasons one is the fact that the film is rated ma in australia and yet the only bit of blood in the whole movie is a jumpy hard to see shot of a chopped off finger another thing i love about this film is that people believed it was real
Jan 25 2009,positive,this has to be the scariest movie ever paranormal activity aint got nothin on this
Jan 25 2009,positive,no the filming didnt make me feel sick to my stomach no i didnt fall for the hype and think it was real yes i did suspend reality while watching it and finally yes it did scare the behoobies out of me
Jan 24 2009,neutral,i really liked the whole cursed side to it but thats it the ending was ba 
Jan 24 2009,negative,amazingly crap film spent the whole film waiting for something to happen
Jan 24 2009,positive,when i saw this movie i was 11 it was 1230 at night when i started it so i was pretty delirious and it scared the fucking shit outta me  so much so that i refused to watch it again until i was 17 or so and then i laughed at my dumbass self cause it wasnt really all that terrifying  still pretty decent though if youre into horror films
Jan 22 2009,positive,pretty groundbreaking for the time
Jan 20 2009,positive,the reason you think this movie sucks is the fact that it is unfortunately easy to level a parody towards in reality though its not that bad in fact its kinda good the writing suffers from the why arent you fucking running syndrome and the stop arguing and start walking while theres still daylight syndrome yet the use of lighting and sound is masterful and the performances are very convincing  horror as an artistic genre always works better when you show instead of tell be it a film or a novel the best horror directors have mastered this the team behind blair witch shows incredible potential
Jan 19 2009,positive,last movie to keep me awake
Jan 19 2009,negative,i was told it would be scary when the credits rolled i was still waiting for the scary part
Jan 19 2009,negative,why was this ever even cool it was dull as hell and snoozeworthy even to a tenyearold
Jan 19 2009,positive,scariness  15 stars  entertainment  55 stars    worth watching once every few years to just to laugh at
Jan 19 2009,neutral,the last few frames of the movie was indeed truly creepy because it was done without any special effects or anything  watching it on the big screen was quite nauseating from the constant movement of the camera  seeing it once was more than enough
Jan 19 2009,positive,one of the most terrifying experiences i have ever experienced if you dont think its scary watch it when you are camping its either going to be a big mistake or a huge success
Jan 19 2009,positive,its not as scary as i thought but some of the scenes were really spooky
Jan 18 2009,neutral,i expected something else the way peeps were talking about total disappointment
Jan 17 2009,negative,not even close to being one of the best or scariest of the horror genre but it is creepy at some parts
Jan 17 2009,negative,a real disappointment sounded so good with the nice idea to avoid showing the evil well it was just a few guys yelling at each other in the forest and screaming like what the  is that
Jan 16 2009,neutral,an interesting concept and could have been a good movie but the end product was mediocre at best
Jan 15 2009,neutral,a very scary film wouldve been better if there was less talking scenes
Jan 15 2009,positive,im more for the intense ghost stories and slasher films but this movie is the best of the movies iv seen without a lot of blood and gore
Jan 14 2009,positive,i think i was the only one in the theater who was freaked out by this moviei knew it wasnt real but it felt realill never watch it again
Jan 14 2009,positive,i saw this movie the day it came out and still thought it was real therefore loving it
Jan 14 2009,positive,all they did was run around some woods with a camcorder and it still scared the shit out of me
Jan 14 2009,neutral,come on seriously they lose the map on purpose and then on top of it stand around and mope  run people run it doesnt matter which way just run its night time so lets stopno keep running  they asked to be killed and got their wish
Jan 13 2009,positive,one of the scariest movies ive ever seen amazing how you can create an effective movie with 3 actors minimal gore no special effects and an improvised script it certainly has its critics but for me it delivers bigtime
Jan 13 2009,negative,this works best as a rental watched in a dark room on a small screen with a good sound system the gimmicky filming can make some viewers feel queasy but it does impart a bit of cinema verite and spookiness to a mediocre spook story its what you dont quite see and what you barely hear that make it scaryif you find it scary at all
Jan 13 2009,negative,this was such a bad film that i wanted to walk out on the cinema
Jan 12 2009,neutral,supposed to be a psychological thriller but not particularly scary however it does a good job showing the deterioration of the minds of the people interestingly the main question isnt answered so youre left wondering whether there is something supernatural or not very interesting movie
Jan 12 2009,positive,good but only watchable once
Jan 11 2009,negative,retarded  i saw this years after it came out and i will never understand how anyone could possibly be gullible enough to buy this crap  are there really human beings out there that believe this was real  two hours of three raving idiots bitching at each other like little girls and pissing themselves over being alone in the woods
Jan 11 2009,positive,atmospheric for about an hour then rubbish for 30 minutes
Jan 10 2009,positive,on october 21 1994 heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams hiked into marylands black hills forest to shoot a documentary film on the local legend the blair witch they were never heard from again one year later their footage was found documenting the students five day journey through the black hills forest and capturing the terrifying events that led to their disappearance
Jan 9 2009,neutral,years after the hype and the hoopla i finally witness this real life event i must admit not as dumb as i thought it would be and on top of that actually sends chills up your spine in several instances the fear is real you can feel it the panic sets in and subsides at daylight and the most effective thing is that these actors are nobodies some people say they get motion sickness but i did not there is a lot of shaky camera work to make it more real but this is not nearly as bad as cloverfield which did make me sick despite its successes though it has several big downfalls the leading lady heather donahue is fking annoying the last half of the movie you just wanna slap her and physically shake her insisting she shuts up also the real aspect is flawed to me cuz these people are just stupid okay guys its 8 am and we have to get to the car but lets just sit around and bitch though until 4 pm oh crap its dark now seriously these guys wasted so much valuable time and have themselves to blame for their death it runs way too long as well cuz its like how many times can you do the same sht and finally everyones gripe no payoff at the end some people love a cliffhanger but with something like this you wanna be rewarded you want to see what the terror is all about and instead you get nothing no explanation no glimpse of a culprit nothing and thats why everyone hates this
Jan 9 2009,negative,ugghh so disappointing but its scary
Jan 9 2009,negative,stupid movie i dont know wat the big deal was about it
Jan 8 2009,negative,im still bitter about this steaming pile of crap
Jan 8 2009,negative,i dont think that the filmmakers really had their own idea of what went on  it was okay but nothing to write home about 90 of the dialogue consisted of the word fuck  yep great reactive acting there guys
Jan 8 2009,positive,the movie was incredible and there was many events that you wouldnt even think would happen the way they shot the camera really made the movie seem more real and the acting was spectacular i would have rated it a 10 if only a friend of mine hadnt said it was fake
Jan 8 2009,negative,i wonder how well this has aged
Jan 8 2009,positive,damn im so disgusted i almost believed it was a real film the extras features were so credible with data history police stuff family friends just about their lost of course the rest about the witch was bullshit for me i was making the conclusion that someone a fanatic did something to them to prove the existence of the witchcraft or the feed that false illusion of that fucking witch but anyways just to find out later it was a student project
Jan 8 2009,positive,i believed it was real for a long time scary
Jan 8 2009,positive,4 stars entirely for the ending which still creeps me out rest of the movie is dumb trash
Jan 7 2009,positive,creative and very scary
Jan 7 2009,positive,scared the crap outta me
Jan 6 2009,negative,really lame but kinda fun watching
Jan 6 2009,positive,the horrifying situations and the reallife elements make this one of the creepiest docs to ever hit the big screen for those who hate it they just dont get what this movie is about its not out there to be one of those lame movies that have no story line horrible acting and try to make that up with frightening images which all comes down to the images which in most cases dont scare you making the film awful this movie doesnt do that watch it again and see what im sayingyoull get it
Jan 5 2009,negative,this had to be one of the worst movies i have ever say i cannot believe i paid money to see it
Jan 5 2009,positive,i was obsessed with this movie when it first premiered and remained fascinated by the story for years afterward watching it on vhs yes predvd playing the computer game after showed a span of time and planning trips to the town where the blair witch apparently was not until now have i really sat down and thought about the great acting by these three young people tell me where you are josh ive never seen something like this pulled off as well or as convincingly as these doomed three i mean people thought this was real and it wasnt due to the credits or the director because obviously those facts would be disregarded it was because there acting was so sincere and the believability of the footage was strong almost unquestionable yes this took great directing but this is an instance where you have to ignore that things didnt get messed up for me until i realized that there had been a blair witch 2 made what a sham but this is definitely worth buying and seeing many times any movie made after this where it was based on some sort of home footage so to speak would be compared to the blair witch project
Jan 4 2009,negative,movie srsly scared the shit outa me
Jan 4 2009,neutral,this totally freaked me out then again i was 14 and had never seen a scary movie
Jan 3 2009,positive,this has got to be one of the creepiest films i have ever seen the thought put into it and the scare it instills in spite or rather because of its low budget are enough to show how remarkable this film is daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez truly made an everlasting mark with this great little scarefest the greatest parts of this film are 1 the antagonist is never seen and 2 it does not contain all the gore that is in many horror films today this film proves that the best horror films are the ones that get into and mess with your head you dont have to have creepy music and cheap scares to be terrifying the unseen is always scarier than anything anyone can show you give this film a chance give it a second chance this is what horror films should be
Jan 3 2009,positive,few films have accomplished what blair witch did the marketing around this movie the idea the low budget its just a work of art to me
Jan 3 2009,negative,i wasnt scared for a second
Jan 3 2009,positive,do you like hearing people fight constantly are you looking for a movie with constant whinning and crying well do i have the movie for you its called the blair witch project though i admit that this movie was pretty creepy for what it was it did nothing but annoy the fuck out of me really ill never set eyes on this again pretty much
Jan 3 2009,positive,a lot was said about this movie i thought it was just acting
Jan 2 2009,positive,a film thats all i could say a film
Jan 2 2009,positive,movie only not rating the hype
Jan 1 2009,positive,suspenseful and nerve wracking dreadfully slow after the theyve been lost for a couple days yet the ease of identification between the audience and the characters makes it more genuine better than cloverfield better than quarantine just for the fact that it didnt waste what it hadthe two newer movies had technology budgets and actors why the hell did they waste them all
Dec 31 2008,positive,nowhere near as good as the hype would lead you to expect the whole cinema verite schtick was not new nonetheless bwp is an effective bit of lowbudget psychological horror
Dec 30 2008,negative,beyond dumb retarded
Dec 30 2008,positive,reinvented the handheld camera in a horror movie thing
Dec 30 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me
Dec 29 2008,negative,great concept great ending terrible acting
Dec 29 2008,negative,ok this could have been so much better
Dec 29 2008,positive,made me a little dizzy in the theatre way to much shaky camera
Dec 28 2008,negative,now say it slowly with me hype
Dec 28 2008,positive,i gotta give the team of filmmakers daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez for the incredible marketing campaign they put forth on this film the blair witch project was an absolute phenomenon that could not be stopped as it spiked peoples interests to the point of hysteria and made the film a shitload of money the blair witch project is about three film students who are making a documentary on the infamous blair witch that supposedly haunts the black hills forest after wandering through the woods the three students are completely lost and feel as though they are being followed by someone or something what happens next is eerily spooky and genuinely chilling especially for how very apparently low the budget was the entire film was posed as a very real thing which fooled people and sent people into hysteria the press and marketing on this film alone is worth five stars however the movie itself is definitely a venture into ultra lowbudget territory that adapts the now very popular cinema verite style of filmmaking cloverfield quarantine this isnt a really bad film at all as it manages to chill the viewer without barely even trying i enjoyed it
Dec 28 2008,negative,so boring i kept waiting for it to get interesting and it never did it made me sick too  the camera movement was too much
Dec 27 2008,negative,why did people go nuts over this
Dec 27 2008,positive,unfortunately for me and other people who hate horror movies this one is very well done my only explanation for the low ratings of other viewers is that they dont have particularly active imaginations or are susceptible to motion sickness after looking through a shaky camera lens for an hour and a half however the constant firstperson view and impressive improvised script make this a really awesome really creepy film just as long as your own imagination scares you more than some scaly blooddripping monster
Dec 27 2008,positive,i literally slept with the lights on for three nights after seeing this for the first time its impact has diminished as ive gotten older but it remains a bonechilling little classic for some reason my enjoyment of this film contributed to my equal liking of the reviled sequel i hope every day for blair witch 3
Dec 26 2008,positive,im afraid to close my eyes im afraid to open them    in october of 1994 three student film makers disappeared in the woods near burkittesville maryland one year later their footage was found    review  highly disturbing shoestring flick that has three college film students going out in the woods of nearby burkittesville maryland to find an entity only known as the blair witch the three individuals do not take the mumbojumbo seriously at first but as they film their journey the tension builds to a fevered pitch strange occurrences and loud nights cause the three to slowly go crazy and their safety becomes a major concern as the clock ticks could the myth really be a reality the blair witch project is one of those films that was copied by hacks in the subsequent years that followed some of them good but a good majority failed this will all cause many to forget how creative and truly original this film is the documentary style and the clever advertising campaign led many to believe that this was in fact reality the craze was on par with that of the exorcist for a short time in 1999 followed by an interesting but somewhat disappointing sequel the blair witch project makes a real case for best horror film of the 1990s and one of the finest productions ever for the usually trivial genre
Dec 26 2008,negative,bleh a movie thats worth seeing once just because its so different i have to give it credit it had me and the people i went to see this movie with who were friends at the time a lot to talk about and we were discussing what happened what its all about etc the rest of that night but after that i dont remember anything good about it just a cheaply made getrichquick scheme
Dec 25 2008,neutral,i went to it blind and was blown away however if you dont go blind into it it could suck
Dec 21 2008,positive,i dont know i just love how hilarious this movie is
Dec 21 2008,negative,this is so dumb people filming each other in the woodshow exciting
Dec 21 2008,positive,fantastic premise extremely well cast ridiculously well shot proof that pretentious film students can make a good movie the ending is a mustsee
Dec 20 2008,neutral,this did not translate to the small screen well
Dec 20 2008,negative,wouldve been better if they showed what the blair witch looked like
Dec 19 2008,positive,a successful mockumentary that create huge impact  the film is not about the witch but the dramatic events that happen when the students were lost  quarrel arguement shouting and screaming are so annoying  non of a single scene make me get frightened only the ending is very creepy  but the audio part of this movie is absoulutely good it is so scary and it really brings you into the mood  bravo
Dec 19 2008,negative,zero stars waste of film
Dec 18 2008,negative,riddle how many college educated persons does it take to realize we are in woods that dont cross state lines and we lost our map we should just walk in one direction until we find something more than they dropped off in these woods w a fucking camera trying to find some weirdo in the woods
Dec 18 2008,positive,scared the st out of me the first time and also made me nauseous  not so great the second time around
Dec 18 2008,negative,awful in every sense of the word
Dec 17 2008,positive,gimmicky  not bad for a small film with no budget  its not good as a rewatchable movie to revisit
Dec 16 2008,negative,do you want your money back too
Dec 16 2008,positive,scared the shit out me the first time i seen it
Dec 15 2008,positive,intriguing to say the least
Dec 15 2008,neutral,almost kinda creepy you wait and wait and wait and then in the last 5 minutes its slight kinda creepy
Dec 14 2008,positive,shes got her eyes on you blair witch not the chick on the box stupid lol
Dec 14 2008,positive,the scariest thing about the blair witch project is the fact that you never see anything its left to your own imagination to what the three students see and the end really creeps me out another horror movie classic which everybody should watch
Dec 13 2008,neutral,its better than most of the crap ive watched lately its funny in a weird way its not necessarily scary but you are curious as to how it is all going to end
Dec 13 2008,positive,a chilling horror movie with an original idea for its time
Dec 12 2008,neutral,if the writerdirectors of this movie can make millions of dollars anybody can i would have liked this movie more if they actually showed the witch the acting was surprisingly good for people who ive never seen act before
Dec 12 2008,positive,i found it quite interesting and i didnt know it wasnt real  i really prefer this kind of low budget film  ive been lost in the woods and it can be freaky  most people have no idea  well done
Dec 10 2008,positive,i know its not real but i still love this movie
Dec 8 2008,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
Dec 7 2008,neutral,it was ok better than the second one at least
Dec 7 2008,negative,this is way city folk shouldnt go camping
Dec 6 2008,negative,one of the worst movies ever
Dec 6 2008,positive,creepy as shit when i was fifteen still gets high marks for originality
Dec 6 2008,positive,like matrix in scifi style blair witch made a little revolution in horror style with the amteurish style of filming now any movie using this method is called blair witch style and the horror is never shown its only suggested which is a mark of quality
Dec 5 2008,positive,scarylike hell
Dec 5 2008,negative,top marks for advertising as a ten minute short would have been fantastic as it iszzzzzzzz
Dec 4 2008,negative,the movie isnt scary and its pretty dumb nothing out of the ordinary is seen  just little noises more interesting then the fourth kind though another movie that claims to be a true story but is fake  because i actually managed to watch this movie all the way through  note i previously gave this a 2 and a half stars but now i am alot more stricter on how i rate movies this is a definite 1 and a half star movie
Dec 4 2008,negative,i got motion sickness sitting still in a cinema
Dec 4 2008,positive,original for its time
Dec 4 2008,positive,very effective horror film very well done unique
Dec 4 2008,negative,a novel concept when it came out but there is absolutely no rewatch value whatsoever
Dec 4 2008,negative,watch if u want to be sea sick the endings a massive let down
Dec 4 2008,negative,biggest and most overrated film of all time this show sucks
Dec 3 2008,negative,another piece of crap that is all i can say my clever insults will not be wasted on this socalled movie
Dec 3 2008,negative,bad memories on this oneblue icee and pull apart twizzlers and shakey camera work
Dec 3 2008,positive,probably one of the scariest movies ive ever seen i thought it was real when it came out but its a proof that you can make a movie with a low budget
Dec 2 2008,positive,the first time i saw this was on a bootleg vhs tape it added to the atmosphere for this flick i honestly believe its a movie where the scare factor depends on what you bring into the movie if your imagination is great youll be truly frightened by what is unseen
Dec 1 2008,positive,afraidsee this one
Dec 1 2008,positive,the only movie that has ever scared me
Dec 1 2008,neutral,this was kinda a massive disappointment i mean there have been worse horror films made but this one was just boring however the style made the plot somewhat believable
Nov 30 2008,positive,a very fantastic and groundbreaking film truly remarkable and incredibly intense to watch
Nov 30 2008,negative,the idea is better than the execution
Nov 30 2008,positive,great the first time you watch it and then you never need to see it again
Nov 30 2008,negative,ruined the film industry
Nov 29 2008,negative,thought it was good when i saw itthen i found out it was made up

Nov 27 2008,positive,boring then totally gripping during the final scene loved the ending
Nov 27 2008,neutral,letterbox logra generar suspenso pero la segunda mitad rompe con el patr√≥n de plausibilidad creado en la primera  does generate suspense but the second half breaks the pattern of believability established in the first one
Nov 27 2008,positive,haha it has its scary moments but in the end is kind of funny
Nov 27 2008,positive,cannibal holocaust makes this look like seseme street entertaining non the less
Nov 27 2008,positive,when i saw this movie and imagined myself in such a situationit was shit scary
Nov 24 2008,positive,i will never go outdoor camping for the rest of my adult life
Nov 24 2008,positive,novel idea but very overrated
Nov 23 2008,positive,unsettling throughout anticipation of horrible things happening and empathy make this film scary the ending is unsatisfying though a far more sincere firstperson film than cloverfield or quarantine
Nov 23 2008,negative,very amateurish anyone with a camcorder some willing friends and some spare time can do this the tough part is the marketing and distribution ill give it half a star for that
Nov 23 2008,positive,oppresive atmosphere and original elaboration makes from this piece one of my favoritessome scenes makes me fear again and again every time i watch it
Nov 23 2008,positive,the blair witch project is brilliant major movies studios spend millions of dollars on making movies that arent half as scary as this the film is done amazingly well and the entire idea is genius the film style is great and so believable and the acting is fantastic and realistic in particular the constant bickering and the scene in which heather breaks down and apologises to the camera the ending is one of the most frightening things i have seen and left me scared also the blair witch project has the most well thought and clever marketing of any movie it is definitely worth a watch a great film
Nov 23 2008,neutral,shame about the ever lasting camcorder battery i want one
Nov 22 2008,positive,for what they were working with they actually did pretty good
Nov 22 2008,positive,actually really scary shame that it isnt a true story and they just lied 
Nov 21 2008,negative,horrible moviewas not scary at all
Nov 20 2008,positive,i know people are sharply divided on this one  i come down on the it scared the crap out of me side of the fence
Nov 19 2008,positive,this is one of those like it or hate it movies  i like the originality involved
Nov 18 2008,positive,what can be done with a little budget
Nov 18 2008,positive,    hello people i hope you all had a great weekend and enjoyed my last chill pill thriller eagle eye today i am coming up with another thriller but a totally different thriller and it is called the blair witch project by seeing the name itself you can assume that this is somekind of horror flick and your not at all wrong it is defently a horror movie but pictured with a hand held camera natural lighting and most importantly without background score that sounds really interesting rightbecause all the horror movies sounds good only when they have dim lights and effective sound engineering then how come this movie creates thrills    film students heather donahue michael williams and joshua leonard go missing in october 1994 while making a documentary about the blair witch a legendary creature believed to haunt the woods near burkittsville maryland they disappear soon after and their bodies are never found a year later the footage the students shot has been recovered and the film in its entirety is composed of fragments of that footage    shot in a mixture of color and black and white with shaky handheld camera movements and only natural lighting the footage includes material that was intended to be used in the documentary but the bulk of the film shows the experience of the three students as they wander through the woods occasionally the view switches out to a kind of mood footage footage of no characters just video of the environment while the audio track continues    soon after setting out they become hopelessly lost their situation worsens when michael in frustration kicks their only map of the area into the river without telling the others over a period of several days a number of terrifying mysterious and possibly supernatural events occur in one scene the crew hikes for more than half of the day only to end up in the same spot where they had started    much of the plot is open to the viewers interpretation including the finale few concrete indications are given as to the eventual fate of the three filmmakers    there is nothing secrecy about the story but the effect is in the naturality of it you never get thought that they are all actors and they are actually acting so much is the reality you just get involved in the movie and travel with them    as per vish this is the most differentdifficult movie to direct as they have to get the best naturality from the actors so they picked all new faces to match their criteria and you know what this movie holds the guinness book of records as having the highest profittocost ratio of a motion picture ever making back over us10000 dollars for every dollar spent this movie earned almost 248 million all over world probably making it highest earning horror film ever so for today enjoy this real life events of filmmakers in the blair witch project    
Nov 17 2008,positive,i was surprisednot in lovebut surprised
Nov 17 2008,positive,no gore or special effects and still one of the creepiest most psychologically unsettling films of the 90s heather can be annoying but her oftparodied confession is a brilliant portrait of unbridled terrorone of the great acting moments from all of horror movie history
Nov 17 2008,positive,i cant watch it alone
Nov 16 2008,negative,i was disappointed like many other people were
Nov 15 2008,positive,scared the piss outa me
Nov 15 2008,positive,im one of the oddballs that actually enjoyed this
Nov 14 2008,positive,looks amateur in directingbut scary of the horrors you never quite see
Nov 13 2008,positive,havent seen it in awhile but i enjoyed it back in the day i still remember the closing moments from the tent being bashed from the outside onwards being scary as all hell
Nov 13 2008,positive,it was great if you saw it in the theater during one of the first weekends it was open it lost its edge if you already heard about it from others
Nov 13 2008,negative,run a tree morons
Nov 12 2008,positive,briliant filmutilizing the imagination of its audience to empose the freakyness just rememberthere is nothing to be afraid of but fear its selfthere is plenty of fear in this film great and original
Nov 12 2008,neutral,only good once after that the gimmick is gone
Nov 11 2008,positive,obviously this is one of those love it or hate it sorts of films and most people wont know if they love it or hate it until the last 15 seconds  personally even after countless viewings i find this one of the most visceral and wholly terrifying movies ive ever seen  the intensity of the story builds and builds to the final sequence which is one of the most frightening scenes i can recall  nothing short of a work of art and a masterpiece
Nov 11 2008,negative,less irritating than cloverfield but also less interesting  boring contrived silly  i havent gone wilderness camping or hiking in a long time but i think anyone with any comfort level in the in the wilderness would find this movie frustrating
Nov 11 2008,positive,edge of your seat stuff
Nov 11 2008,positive,this is a great freaky flick  no blood and gore just something to really freak you out  nice and creepy  i love it
Nov 10 2008,positive,one of the few truly scary movies that has been made with intelligence once you buy its premise you simply cant object anything about it if it gets you it grabs you and simply doesnt let you go some say its boring ok go rent another friday the 13th real horror aint to see the guts of people but comes from the unknown
Nov 10 2008,positive,i thought the ending really sucked  it just left you up in the air like what the fk happened  i was hoping there would of been a part ii
Nov 9 2008,neutral,those who fell for it are stupid
Nov 9 2008,positive,one of the scariest movies ever  probably my number 2
Nov 9 2008,positive,this was a good movie for its time and i really enjoyed it when i was younger not so good now but it was the first film of its kind and that counts for something
Nov 9 2008,positive,scarysuspensceand horrifying all at the same time
Nov 9 2008,neutral,put some work into it and i could make a better handycam moviestory isnt that bad
Nov 8 2008,positive,it doesnt come around very often that a movie comes around that truely scares people well the blair witch project is one of those movies the film is an innovative piece of filmmaking and really a testament to the filmmakers who could create such a horrifying movie on such a lowbudget     the film follows three film students who want to make a documentary on a local legend in the burkittslville maryland area they soon realize that the legend is true and they begin to lose all mental stability the little things added in this movie create a terrifying feeling that makes you believe that these kids are going to die     the film is shot in a documentary style and is very very effective in making you believe that this is really happening the ending to the film is perfect and i dont want to ruin it for anyone so i will not speak of the ending     although the film is not based on true events and this really didnt happen it still gives you a sense of dread throughout the movie this film really does work and should go down as a horror movie classic this is a near perfect film score 90100fresh
Nov 8 2008,positive,before this movie was released a couple of national news channels brought us the story of these students making a documentary who got lost in the woods no biggie this kind of thing happen all the time there was a difference however the tape was found the people who found the tape were going to release the tapes to theatres so we all pile in to see it the next 90 minutes was one of the most chilling experiences i have ever witnessed people were screaming and crying by the last scene but it was so damn exhilirating it wasnt till afterwards that we found out it was fake but the movie changed me if you want to be scared watch this by yourself in the middle of the night out in a cabin in the woods
Nov 7 2008,positive,you watch this movie once then the second time you feel it is kinnda slow but it is etertaining to think of it you never get to see anything you head fills in the blank spaces since everyone said this really happend made things creepy
Nov 7 2008,positive,a movie that will always be remembered for its profit and advertising gimmicks which is sad because it is a genuinely tense thriller
Nov 6 2008,positive,one of the scarriest things i have ever seen
Nov 6 2008,positive,probably my favorite of the shaky camera genre it does not rely on quick frights like the majority of mainstream horror but instead takes full advantage of the camera the woods and the creepy atmosphere highly recommend
Nov 5 2008,positive,never been to a movie that induced the urge to vomit before somewhat poor filming choice if you can get over that it was actually a pretty great film
Nov 5 2008,neutral,a true horror movie using elements of terror other than popout ghosts and gory violence well for the most part to attempt to scare unfortunately the movie reallt did not scare and it was just not good overall as a film the movie built up towards a climax that happened far too quickly and would leave most audiences pissed off and wanting more far too melodramatic as well
Nov 5 2008,positive,i saw this in the theater when it came out and all i could think at the time was that id never seen anything else like it  even though you never see anything more than piles of rocks and little stick people its still somehow creepy as fuck  i just watched it again in broad daylight and it was still creepy almost a decade later  makes you want to go camping for the weekend  am i right  ill get the tent
Nov 5 2008,positive,this is a very well acted scripted and directed film it gives you the feeling your actually watching a reel student documentary you will forget its fake the only problem i have is the second time through the movie failed to keep me entirely interested its a small gripe
Nov 5 2008,positive,hard to believe that so many people thought it was real but still i thought it was pretty well put together
Nov 4 2008,negative,motion sickness gets me about 10 minutes in ive heard the whole thing but havent seen it
Nov 4 2008,neutral,sorry but this is very overrated and i hate the shaky realistic cameras
Nov 2 2008,positive,really fn scary  a week later we went campin and i about crapped my pantz onze hike
Nov 2 2008,positive,bone chilling deffinately dont want to watch it then go on a hike afterwards
Nov 2 2008,positive,i dug itand it didnt make me sick in the theater pansies
Nov 2 2008,neutral,does not withstand the test of time
Nov 2 2008,positive,i didnt like it when i saw it  but it made me keep thinking about it  in the end despite some of the poor performances i liked it  it was like a kids play acting game played by adults  great idea
Nov 2 2008,positive,hmmit was okgreat ending but it took way too long to get going
Nov 1 2008,positive,i saw this at 3 in the afternoon and it still scared the crap out of me  i knew it was hyped and not even real but the concept movie found in the woods was really not as far fetched as some made it out to be  i am not one for horror movies and this was just creepy enough
Nov 1 2008,positive,this wonderful film really screws with your mind truly original
Nov 1 2008,positive,i think this was pretty good when i saw it for the first time
Nov 1 2008,negative,the stupidest movie of all time it was like a low budget cloverfield movie with a bunch of swearing and  lack of common sense i cant believe they made a sequence for this crap
Nov 1 2008,positive,centerbimg  bi have just been blown away by the tremendous level of dread and the heartstopping ending to the blair witch project this film is a true milestone in the horror genre and its impact is still very much intact as it was in 1999 the three selftitled actorscharacters of heather michael and joshua especially heather donahue convey relatable personalities personalities that gradually dissipitate as an unknown terror engulfs them in madness the masterful atmosphere of nervefrying dread and paranoia of the unknown but omnipresent villain the blair witch is handled expertly through the video diary format from directors dan myrick and eduardo sanchez the song stayin alive from the beegees rang throughout my head while enduring this uscary as hellu fright flick which ironically states in the choruss refrained lyrics the mental and physical position of the characters b      centerbim going nowhere bcenter  centerbsomebody help me im stayin alivebcenter    centerimg  leftbin a nutshell the blair witch project centers around heather a cheery and ambitious filmmakerdirector who recruits two guys michael and joshua to work with various equipment including the big camera food supplies battery power and their tent her project concerns the legend of the blair witch in the black hills outside of a small maryland town its plan is to document the background and history of the legend the towns opinions of it and to finally venture out into the woods to locate two sites before heading back many of the townsfolk and one loon are open to it and are suprisingly knowledgeable about the topic while also admitting that its an unsettling topic along their way through the two sites they find subtle signs that make them recall some words that a townsperson told them heather is sure enough about her project but she has no idea what shes in store forin no time a mysterious person or something begins to mess with their heads during a few nights building up mental paranoia for each three to the point where disorientation becomes inevitable bleft  centerbimg  leftbfrom here the blair witch project pumps up the terror and dread guage to fever pitch leaving little room to think and plenty of time to fixate and wonder whats just beyond their reach and sight as the situation becomes increasingly intense and desperate you can feel your temperature drop as the characters morale detiriorates and youre emotions begin to drain out of you ive never experienced a horror film and a film of any kind like this before not even this years cloverfield and quarantine both inspired with the video diary technique and the descent its so photorealistic inyourface and mindboggling that it fries your nerves thinking about the heartstopping ending is still making me jump and im sure i have not been the only one on that all in all the blair witch project is a meticulously crafted and nightmarish mocdoc with an unshakable atmosphere and omnipresent villain that is a symbol of proof that the unknown and what is not seen is what scares us most this is used against us in an effective horror film and its experience is one to remember but definitely not cherish be ready for more critiques and opinions on every game and movie i can get my hands onbleft    centerbimg bcenter
Nov 1 2008,positive,saw it in theater and was sick motion sick for hours afterwards
Nov 1 2008,positive,scary you kinda need a good sense of imagination to find it scary imo very good
Oct 31 2008,positive,so this is pretty good in fact i think its really good    accident or not the psychological angle is ultimately successful and pretty scary the cinema verite style is also welldone keeping the shaky cam to a minimum keep mind ive never seen this in theaters while the constant threat and looming terror of the unknown is effective the awkward pacing and storytelling leave lots to be desired
Oct 31 2008,negative,how lame was this movie
Oct 31 2008,positive,the best part is i watched this in the middle of the woods on my ipod  at night  so i was pretty creeped out
Oct 31 2008,positive,i know a lot of people are hating on this film but i really liked it sure heather mike and josh freak out at each other every 510 min in the film but they are lost and a lil paranoid that a witch is following them i like how you can build suspense around basically nothing but sticks and creepy sounds i prefer this movie any day to gore films like saw or texas chainsaw massacre
Oct 30 2008,positive,not a lot of acting chops from the cast but it gets huge props for the way it was filmed its understanding of terror vs gore and the wicked smart ad campaign
Oct 30 2008,positive,every time i watch this movie i catch another piece of information i didnt notice the last time i watched it
Oct 30 2008,negative,the movie trailer for this movie is better then the movie if you want to see a movie pull this concept off better check out cannibal holocaust
Oct 30 2008,positive,scary at points but not as scary as imagined the final scene was a bit too short to get a hang of what happened
Oct 29 2008,positive,honestly i dont know why people hate on this movie so much i think its one of the best scary movies of all time
Oct 29 2008,positive,the blair witch project is the real deal in horror and much more than a clever marketing scheme  its geniunely chilling and proves to be nearly as tedious for the viewer as it is for the characters  we get angry when the characters get angry  we feel hopeless once theyve given up on hope  we feel everything theyre feeling and thats why the blair witch project is so effective  it doesnt feel like a movie but something more  my only problem with it is the film can get boring and the final scene is somewhat lacking in a payoff  with that being said however it is a testament to the actors performances which are some of the finest displays of acting youre likely to see in low budget horror that the film remains tense throughout  i recommend it if you havent seen it
Oct 29 2008,positive,fonttahomacolordarkorange2 the blair witch projectcolorfont    img  fonttahomacolordarkorangeat this time of the year every time i drive by a forest i wonder whats going on inside of it i can thank ithe blair witch project ifor that feeling words cant describe how terrified i was when i first saw this movie in fact ive seen this flick about 5 times and each time ive been scared really scared the best thing about it is that it seems incredibly real which is what the filmmakers were going for you can actually believe that this is the actual footage that was found in the woods the film basically consists of a bunch of scenes thrown together and is not necessarily set up like a hollywoodstyle movie which adds to the authenticity this is an expert class for what scary movies should be like whatever is hunting the three student filmmakers is never shown proving that our imagination can be much more frightening than what is really there even though we never see anything the scenes when they are in the tent at night have truly affected me for life while this movie may be a love ithate it type of deal its one of if not my favorite horror movie it introduced a new style of filming and displays what horror should behorrifyingcolorfont
Oct 29 2008,negative,i blame the internet
Oct 28 2008,negative,probably the most over rated movie of all timenothing happens not to mention they actualy made a sequel of this trash
Oct 28 2008,positive,not a stellar movie but truly appreciate young filmakers passion
Oct 27 2008,positive,a very interesting movie the first time i watched it i was totally freaked out i swear i was walking up my stairs and i kept looking behind me but this movie is probably only scary the first time you see it because you dont know what is going to happen a really good horror movie gets you everytime however i think the end where mike is standing in the corner as heather dies will always give me chills still a really good movie overall
Oct 27 2008,positive,damn how i shat my pants back in the days this was the most intense horror movie i have ever seen and after almost 10 years it still thrills me genuine in every way
Oct 26 2008,positive,overall the blair witch project succeeds in what it sets out to do fool you into thinking that what ur seeing is real the film is definitely novel  goes to prove that sometimes lessis more countless imitators tried to follow in blair witchs footsteps the stfrancisville experiment comes to mind  they all suck that just goes to show how good blair witch project really is i wouldnt call it the most terrifying movie ever made but i will say that it is very involving and unsettling if seen in the right environment  today everybody know about the blair witch project the marketing overdose which accompanied the films immense success personally turned me off to the movie for a while but two years later i got to appreciate the film again for what it is an original effective eerie mockumentory this film is best enjoyed if viewed in an appropriate setting i sayhave several friends over a couple of beers each shut all the lights unplug the phones and enter the burkittsville woods with the gang
Oct 25 2008,neutral,its called kleenexbut yeah the movieuh good only because the whole home video was a new and cool idea not really well known so everyone was like ooh and ahh but now after seeing movies like clvoerfield and quarantinewhcih do the same home video thing but way more extreme the blair witch project just doesnt seem cool anymore ill rate it as if i havent seen cloverfield but if i were to rate it now after seeing cloverfield it would be like1just saying
Oct 24 2008,positive,see this for the sheer originality
Oct 23 2008,positive,one of the scariest  creepiest movies ive seen
Oct 23 2008,positive,scared the hell out of me and pee scared the hell and pee out of me
Oct 23 2008,negative,very poor flicker hardly believable  a few years ago the texas chainsaw massacre was realized with the same budget
Oct 22 2008,negative,i was so mad that i wasted my money on this
Oct 22 2008,positive,this film is not for the casual viewer the documentarystyle in which it is shot does however bring a frightful experience since you get the impression that the events really happened also the fact that you dont see what lurks in the woods is actually really effective recommended
Oct 21 2008,negative,awful awful awful  this movie is so bad it was the 2nd film of 4 at a drive in and people actually left lots of themi should have  all hype 2 hours of my life i can never get back
Oct 20 2008,neutral,the second one sucked  the premise to this was good  the unknown actors were annoying
Oct 19 2008,negative,polarizing film i hated it for the bad bad acting and obvious attempt at skirting a budget  why not just make my own film like this
Oct 19 2008,positive,very good for a cheap movie
Oct 19 2008,negative,im so scared right now
Oct 18 2008,negative,horrible movie i thought this was a pretty good idea for a movie but the movie sucked really good acting for a horror movie but the movie overall sucked sooo bad wat a waste of time horrible movie
Oct 18 2008,negative,this was horrible and made me violently ill
Oct 18 2008,negative,its really really boring until the very end
Oct 18 2008,negative,oooh scary lets run around the woods like dumbasses
Oct 18 2008,positive,the majority of people that didnt like this film are poed cause they found out it was fabricated to look real  come on people do you honestly think they would release a snuff film publicly  youre angry cuz you got duped and thats the other part that made this film so great
Oct 18 2008,negative,waste of time worse film ever made in my opinion
Oct 18 2008,positive,an interesting experiment
Oct 18 2008,positive,the heavilyimprovised pseudodocumentary style of √¢the blair witch project√¢ has an interesting tradeoff the technique doesnt afford the filmmakers conventional moodbuilding tools like music or stylized photography but the feeling they achieve is unlike any that conventional methods could ever produce the cast is beyond convincing and the film is so ripe with foreshadowing that we feel unnerved before our trio of characters even start their illfated trek with a modest budget of only 24000 this movie is a triumph of originality and creativity over limited means
Oct 18 2008,positive,watched this for the 1st time since middle school  still scary but the movies not as good as i rememberedbut very inventive and an important film
Oct 17 2008,positive,god this movie is soo scarey i love it
Oct 17 2008,neutral,overrated overhyped
Oct 16 2008,negative,gives me a headache everytime i attempt to watch it
Oct 16 2008,positive,the greatest movie ever made
Oct 16 2008,positive,the movie itself wasnt anything special but it was awesome at the time it came out because people thought it was real especially those who saw the bootlegged version it was a viral phenomenon that will never be replicated
Oct 16 2008,negative,if there was a place in hell reserved for movies this one would be at the bottom this movie was so bad and horrible in every way i had to leave the theater i even requested my money back and to this day this is still the only movie bad enough to have requested money back
Oct 15 2008,positive,one of the most creative movies out there still scares me cant watch it with the lights off one of the best things about this movie was that a lot of people thought it was a true story the hand held camera shooting creates a truly scary realism
Oct 15 2008,negative,okay so you run around in a forest and some rocks are in a pile and im supposed to believe this is real horrible film
Oct 15 2008,negative,absolute guff the least scariest fim iv ever seen and plus really boring pretentious shite
Oct 15 2008,positive,i bought this and swapped it so many times from hmv before i found a copy that worked in fact one time they gave me back the copy that skipped along with the working copy so now i have two of these at home but thats bytheby its an ok film a good example of what you can do on a tight budget with a little imagination
Oct 15 2008,negative,a star for originality and for tricking so many people
Oct 14 2008,positive,i got so motion sick i had to call in sick
Oct 13 2008,negative,hell this was the worst waste of 2 hours ive ever seen i could flush my head in a toilet bowl and be more entertained sheesh
Oct 13 2008,negative,i thought it was absoloute shit
Oct 13 2008,neutral,on review the blair witch project seemed more like a cheap student film rather then the smart horror film i remembered it to be it still managed to spook me at points but never to the extent it did back in the day
Oct 13 2008,positive,the biggest event movie of the 1990s and the first to use the internet as a source of viral marketing anyone nowadays would have guessed the blair witch project was a multibillion dollar blockbuster the dark knight its day when really and perhaps this has something to do with the era it was made this massive hype was generated over a grainy shaky studentstandard film about being lost in the woods it was less dark knight and more titanic becoming the most successful film ever made making almost 100 times its budget how the film world has chased that dream ever since  as with any 90s horror this is played with full cynicism and a sense of reality the handheld camera makes it feel like a snuffhome movie which already creates an atmosphere of ambiguity is this supposed to be real or not but if the technique makes the atmosphere its the acting that amplifies it subtle references to surroundings echo louder into a more terrifying reality over the course of the film the woods take on the appearance of a maze never ending and encircling and in a subconscious reversal the eternal open spaces have never seemed more claustrophobic  little really needs to be said since its such a short and individual film that its more of a personal discovery admittedly some dialogue slips into obvious exposition and some of the spookier elements seem hokey and almost dated even but theres a relentless terror that begins as uneasy undercurrent and avalanches into warped hysteria forever squeezing events into the tiny frame of the cameras restricting us to only a small portion of the world outside  if anything this is what cloverfield wants to grow up to be without the obvious digital augmentation in postproduction to remove the real graininess the blair witch project is the ultimate oldschool highconcept lowbudget film one executed with style conviction and a decade on and away from the saturated hype fresh in its terror brr
Oct 13 2008,negative,horrible film but i have to tip my hat to a job well done by the makers of it they spent 22000 making it and it made around 250 million world wide thats what i call a success personally i hated the film though
Oct 13 2008,negative,know how things seem much more scary as a kid but when you look back you wonder what were you so worried about at the beginning i remember hearing about the blair witch project as a kid and reading the stuff on the internet about the missing students and all the other promotion stuff now ill admit i was terrified as a kid but almost a decade later now that all the promotion stuff and everything else about the film is gone you figure out rather quickly how much the film depended on its marketing and gimmick over crafting a real film dont get me wrong its a great concept and well shot but the blair witch project has aged as well as that sandwitch homer simpson kept after the workers picket at its best when you try to forget all its clear problems and age
Oct 13 2008,positive,i watched it by myself late at night on tv it scared the shit out of me then it ended and i felt stupid i thought n2 was better
Oct 13 2008,negative,this does not do it for me whats scary about gigglig kids in thhe woods or piles of sticks it might be brownies i just thought it really didnt deserve the hype although the end is good and when i saw it i hoped it would get good after that but it didnt
Oct 12 2008,positive,this scared the crap out of me at the time but i thought the ending was lame
Oct 11 2008,positive,i havent watched it since the first weekend it came out but it was genuinely freaky at the time
Oct 11 2008,negative,this movie was just so pointless nothing happened for the whole movie all they did was bitch about the map for a fuckin hour and just when you think there mite be gore what do they do they just have the camera drop on the ground and you dont even get to see the chicks dead body also the atmosphere wasnt even good it was really crappy
Oct 11 2008,positive,brilliant camera work looked pretty cheesey but still one hell of a movie
Oct 10 2008,positive,best horror film ever made makes me want to go camping every fall 
Oct 10 2008,positive,i know amongst some of you its not cool or hip to like this movie but i was fine with it and yeah i thought it was scary  of course watching it a 4th or 5th time will soften the sting
Oct 9 2008,negative,overrated piece o crap
Oct 9 2008,negative,all hype and no substance i might have been scared if i could see what the hell was going on
Oct 8 2008,negative,wow this was so bad i wanted to gouge my eyes and ears out i fell asleep
Oct 8 2008,neutral,revolutionary but not really all that good
Oct 8 2008,negative,this is not particularly a good movie by any means but i do give them credit for actually fooling a bunch of idiots into thinking this was real a few creepy moments at best
Oct 8 2008,negative,words cant even begin to describe how much i fucking hate this movie
Oct 8 2008,positive,well acted it had everybody fooled at first
Oct 7 2008,negative,the hype was better than the movie
Oct 7 2008,positive,its good the first couple times
Oct 7 2008,positive,was a good idea but not executed well
Oct 7 2008,positive,brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant  the most scared ive ever been at the pictures
Oct 6 2008,positive,the best horror film ever made in my opinion and yes i have seen the exorcist utilizing the viewers imagination this movie allows the audience to discover and unravel the plot with the characters providing a much more atmospheric and tense viewing experience also never revealing the blair witch was a step forward from the jaws method examining the nature of fear itself instead of gratifying itself with a definite answer of whether the title creature exists or not in the end nobody knows whether they drove themselves crazy out of fear or if they actually encountered a ghost making it a bit scarier
Oct 6 2008,positive,a brilliant catalyst for anyone that constantly scares themselves at night with nothing but a dark room and their overactive imagination
Oct 6 2008,positive,i wont lie i like this movie a lotprobably way more than it deserves  but being from the northeast and doing a lot of camping in woods similar to that of seneca creek state park with in fact the same model of tent used by heather mike and josh i could relate very well with the situation presented in this movie    true it isnt realbut neither are the million other horror flicks out there and this comes as close to real as possible  the movie isnt particularly scary if you just watch it without thought but if you put yourself in their shoes and think about how you would react to what they went through it becomes pretty freaky    its all in your mindif youre looking for straightup horror you wont find it here  but if youre a thinking type who likes suspending your own disbelief youll find good scare value in this movie
Oct 6 2008,neutral,pretty lame a lot of hype for a b movie
Oct 6 2008,negative,this gave me nightmares for a few years and if i think about it too long i think that i might start having nightmares about it again
Oct 6 2008,positive,ok when it came out but gets worse and less memorable every day
Oct 6 2008,positive,a very tricky one to rateon one hand it is quite original and very good at building tension the scariness comes more from the fact that the characters are lost in the woods and cant find their way back rather than the underdeveloped supernatural aspects there really is no story and no point but it was still interesting
Oct 6 2008,neutral,i was expecting so much read so many good reviews when i actually watch it it was just a stupid movie dunno maybe i was just dissapointed
Oct 5 2008,positive,went to see it the night it was released  many people at the time thought it was actually a real documentary  we knew it was fiction but it still scared the crap out of me
Oct 5 2008,positive,it depends where you see it
Oct 5 2008,positive,there are two kinds of people when it comes to this movie  those who cant get past the enormous hype lack of production values and the many miscellaneous aspects of this movie that separate it from what people have always been accustomed to and comfortable with and there are people like me who embrace all of the aforementioned partially as a reaction to that negativity and who are just more willing to embrace an endeavor of this nature  this movie isnt any more stupid than 90 of the horror movies preceding it and unlike most of those this shit was terrifying to me  it was new and different and it ushered in an era of independent film that seemed to say that if youre clever enough you dont need fake blood a movie star production values a good camera or an experienced writer and director
Oct 5 2008,positive,this movie really was revolutionary even though a year after it came out it got dissed up the wazoo
Oct 5 2008,positive,this too creeped me out a whole lot still never been camping x
Oct 5 2008,positive,way too long plus its hard when all 3 people are douchebags
Oct 4 2008,positive,very scary if you watch this on your own do not watch this on a portable dvd player in the forest
Oct 3 2008,negative,if i could give this less than half a star i would worst film ever
Oct 3 2008,positive,omg this has to be one of the scariest movies ive seen but it was still kinda lame how you didnt get the see how it ended and you have no idea of what happened next                              one of the scariest horror movies
Oct 2 2008,positive,suspenseful at times and i thought the ending was great for such a cheap film
Oct 2 2008,positive,amazing they cam make such a scary movie on such a low budget genious
Oct 2 2008,negative,i really didnt like this movie
Oct 2 2008,positive,a lot of copycats out there nowadays but when this came out it was something else  scared the ever living out of me at the time
Oct 1 2008,negative,you know i could run around screaming and pointing a camcorder at myself too
Sep 30 2008,positive,great movie has a good story line
Sep 30 2008,positive,i have been creeped out by stone walls ever since
Sep 30 2008,neutral,saw this only recently for the first time i didnt know what to expect and i was kinda disappointed i thought itd be scarier than it turned out to be
Sep 30 2008,negative,i hate this movie trying to make it appear as a documentary with actual footage of event another cloverleaf ho hum
Sep 29 2008,positive,a truly original horror movie saw it several years ago at the theater without knowing anything about it and it scared the crap out of me just saw it on dvd and it is still creepy should have never made a sequel
Sep 29 2008,positive,lets start by statingthis was not the first film made like this the first one to truly do it was cannibal holocast its not bad it is a little creepy in parts and the ending was very cool tenson got high wich was cool when they argued becuase if ya think about itwhat els is there to do when your lostno one stays nice but why i hate it soooo many knock offs after wards made for faaar less money can you beleave it was made for 70 or so grand i thought at most when i first saw it it made for grand at the most
Sep 29 2008,neutral,definitely made a different type of horror movie but it wasnt actually horror i wud call this an emtion driven film there was no point in the film that i got scared i like the concept and all the unsolved ideas but  it jst didnt work as a horror for my liking and 248 million it earned wtf
Sep 28 2008,positive,this scared the everlovin sht out of me
Sep 28 2008,positive,great marketing surrounding this film which definitely added to the intrigue when it came out i like the fact that a lot of what happens is left to the audiences interpretation even more scary that way
Sep 28 2008,negative,one of the worst movies in film making historyalong with cloverfield
Sep 28 2008,positive,its great it makes you afraid of something you dont see there are no auwful creatures no blood
Sep 27 2008,positive,im going to give it 4 stars for the first time i saw it  after that it would get 1 maybe 2
Sep 26 2008,positive,i watched this after wanting to see it for quite along time there is one problem with this movie though the middle was so god damn boring the start of course peoples own stories they heard as children and them starting the trip and the ending is scary and terrifying and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time but the middle is a big disappointment of course you cant really do anything with the middle i understand that but by the end of the movie i wanted to kill that heather chick so bad her voice drove me crazy although i bitch about the middle the ending was fantastic it was a gripping ending with nothing more
Sep 25 2008,positive,im never going camping again
Sep 25 2008,negative,one of the crappiest doco i have seen the acting was not that good since they swear more than 100 times also the camera was bad too shaky and find it hard whats going on
Sep 24 2008,positive,saw this in germany while in the army hadnt heard any of the hypefor a moment thought it could be real
Sep 23 2008,positive,i think the coolest part of this is that i dont think its meant to scare you really but if it were to happen in real life isnt this the way it would appear
Sep 23 2008,positive,i actually liked this movie
Sep 23 2008,positive,if you go down to the woods today
Sep 22 2008,positive,pound for pound the most visceral transference of fear ive ever experienced from a fictional motion picture  and all for just a paltry 32000  how can that be when so little is seen onscreen  because of the trendsetting documentarystyle firstperson approach and the complete immersion it brings to the viewing experience  i feel like im right there with heather josh and michael lost in the woods and hunted by beings unknown  the actors were subjected to the conditions seen in the film which makes their fatigue and desperation seem so real  because those aspects are real  upon its release many people thought this was a documentary and had to be told otherwise  those are the reasons why the oftimitated the blair witch project ranks as a landmark in cinematic horror history    i recently watched this for what feels like the 8th time and still manages to create chills during certain scenes and also drops a dollop of perfectly suited black comedy at just the right times  simply put a brilliant idea executed brilliantly  i notice now that there are a couple places that plod a bit but this still ranks among the fastest 90minutes spent at the movies  because you are there
Sep 22 2008,positive,ok when it came out it was really freaky and scary but now after all of the spoofs it is really hard to take it seriouslyso i am transporting myself back in time to the first time i saw the ending and freaked out
Sep 22 2008,positive,you either love it or you hate it there are no inbetweens to me the movie was a terrifying masterpiece the ending was so intense and disturbing it gives me shivers just thinking about it
Sep 22 2008,negative,oh my god whoever made this film should be shot in the face
Sep 22 2008,positive,very original  but not at all the most freakin mov ever like we so often heard  n read about it  cloverfield and rec  its remake quarantine all used the way to shot popularized but not created by tbwp
Sep 21 2008,negative,this movie bored me half to death  dont see what the big fuss was about
Sep 21 2008,positive,great for its time and still pretty scarey  too much hype if anything
Sep 21 2008,positive,truely great and orignal
Sep 20 2008,positive,i dont know why but i seem to enjoy movies like this makes it scarier
Sep 20 2008,negative,really really really bollocks and crappo waste of my life
Sep 20 2008,negative,another one not what it was hyped up to be
Sep 20 2008,positive,this is an effective creepy as hell movie1 the crying baby thing gave me chills and the rest of the movie doesnt falter which is amazing considering the godforsaken low budget of the film this one is really worth checking out for horror and suspense fans
Sep 20 2008,positive,annoying could have been so much better but that last scene freaky
Sep 20 2008,negative,one of the worst movie ive ever seen be away from this i couldnt stay at theatre at the second part before it i leave
Sep 19 2008,positive,probably the scariest movie i have ever seen
Sep 19 2008,positive,ive spent alot of time in the woods so i could really relate to this movie it was so scary it was like i was there and the interactions between the characters were so realistic exactly how people would react to that situation no cheezy one liners i never get tired of watching it
Sep 19 2008,negative,positively one of the most stupid no making sense movie
Sep 19 2008,positive,on a rainy night at one in the morning after little sleep much coffee and copious amounts of hype about how the footage was real this movie scared the shit out of me well promoted directors
Sep 19 2008,positive,for the time it came out it was unprecedented
Sep 19 2008,positive,fantastically effective amateur filmmaking
Sep 19 2008,negative,good idea  bad movie
Sep 19 2008,positive,this movie affected me deeply
Sep 18 2008,positive,saw it alone in a theater and it scared the crap outta me
Sep 18 2008,negative,way overrated    not really all that scary save for the confusing ending     also unfortunately started a ring of copycats     still resonates today with movies like cloverfield and quarantine which essentially are just crappy remakes with different premises    you can write a script like this with mad libs
Sep 18 2008,negative,theres two hours i will never get back
Sep 17 2008,positive,screw the exorcist this is the creepiest movie ever made
Sep 17 2008,positive,not scary yet chilling
Sep 17 2008,positive,this is one of the only movies ive ever seen that acturally scares me it just seems so real the fear of the unknown is alot scarrier than a bunch of fancy cgi monsters and costumes
Sep 16 2008,negative,i understand what they were trying to do and it was very realistic but the ending kind of abandoned the entire point altogether
Sep 16 2008,negative,i think this movie had a good plot and was well done i would give it more stars but it scared the living shit out of me and ruined camping forever
Sep 16 2008,negative,good advertising crap movie
Sep 15 2008,positive,still really good  i would like to know how much dialogue was scripted and what was ad libbed during filminga landmark film
Sep 15 2008,positive,for the longest time i thought this was real
Sep 15 2008,positive,this is da scariest movie ever
Sep 15 2008,positive,doesnt have the same impact it once did but still a very wellcrafted tense and interesting idea
Sep 14 2008,negative,stupid movie that seems to be about running around looking at trees
Sep 14 2008,positive,this movie freaked me out the first time i saw it  being right there alongside the characters as they go through this situation where neither you or them know whats going on is pretty terrifying  plus the conclusion is pretty harrowing and leaves you somewhat traumatized  good stuff
Sep 14 2008,positive,ah the movie that made me had motion sickness
Sep 14 2008,positive,the best new horror movie what i like about this movie is the fact it doesnt show a lot and its still more scary than most of todays horror movies with tons of special effects and make up the story is simple and the horror inside the mysterious forest is shown really realistic the horror which clearly shows that the most horryfying thing is fear of unknown
Sep 13 2008,neutral,highest costprofit ratio im pretty sure
Sep 13 2008,negative,boring dont waste your time
Sep 13 2008,positive,i just love those horror movies
Sep 12 2008,positive,i hate it when people say they dont like this film because it wasnt scary enoughplease     i didnt find it scary either but this is probably the most innovative film ever made in the history of filmmaking the simple touches of screams door opening and shutting and childrens fingerprints on the wall make this film more realistic and in that sense more unbelievable
Sep 12 2008,negative,watch the beginning then skip to the endthe middle is pure crapthe ending is chilling
Sep 12 2008,negative,silly and stupid had more fun on my camping holiday
Sep 12 2008,neutral,its a good concept not quite pulled off well enough to be satisfying  but its hyper disorientating hypnotic and hilarious  they just never stop shouting a good watch
Sep 12 2008,positive,a haunting little indie film really genius concept and execution not to mention the marketing campaign
Sep 12 2008,positive,okis this the greatest movie ever no but was it the scariest freakin movie in the world when it first came out and everyone was saying it was real whether or not you want to admit you believed it hell yeah it may not stand up over multiple watchings but almost guaranteed the first time someone watches this movie at night with the lights off and god forbid alone like i didby the last scene theyll be hinding under the sofa
Sep 12 2008,positive,scared the hell out of me the first time i saw itnow its become so campy is great fun
Sep 11 2008,negative,one great thing about this moviei discovered i get motion sickness from watching jumpy crap
Sep 11 2008,positive,great idea expertly executed left me wanting more and all i got was a lousy ripoff sequel its the marmite of the horror world but i firmly sit on the love it side of the fence top quality psychological horror
Sep 11 2008,neutral,good concept but not as scary as the hype made me believe  great build up of suspense
Sep 11 2008,positive,you have to admit it was unique
Sep 9 2008,positive,this was good i thought i think it started to bring back some of the better horror flicks
Sep 9 2008,negative,very weird not even scary
Sep 9 2008,negative,is there a minus star this is a stupid annoying film bogus bull shite
Sep 9 2008,negative,essentially a horror movie that fails miserably at being even remotely chilling
Sep 9 2008,neutral,if i wanted to sleep id have stayed at home expected more
Sep 9 2008,positive,sometimes it helps to see a movie way after the hype so not to be tempted to try and work forces against the hype i found it surprisingly good and tense and more than an interesting experiment and the last scene is a gggreat idea
Sep 8 2008,positive,absolutely brilliant and chilling horror film that will never get the proper recognition it deserves  everything about this film is brilliant  each derogative thing anyone says about the film comes from the fact that that person doesnt understand something  for example  heather donahue won the razzie for worst actress  well for the most part she wasnt acting  these young adults were thrown into the woods with a couple cameras and a limited ration of food with only the vaguest of ideas of what the filmmakers were going to surprise them with  the emotions and reactions you see are genuine  if you dont like this film try thinking about everything from a different perspective  basically let it invade your mind and imagine how you would feel lost in woods that are supposed to be haunted
Sep 8 2008,positive,creepy if you get to watch it thinking its based on a true story
Sep 8 2008,positive,probably the 2nd most terrifying movie ive ever seen in a theatre
Sep 8 2008,negative,i got dizzy with this movie
Sep 8 2008,positive,anybody that doesnt find this movie scary or creepy probably doesnt have an imagination or is so pissed at the fact that such a low budget film made so much money honestly it scared the shit out of me the use of the crapy cameras just made it seem more real
Sep 8 2008,positive,at the movies very creepy at home not so much
Sep 7 2008,positive,every time i think or watch this film chillis come down my spine this movie is so scary and effective they dont even need to show this creature called the blair witch to take an effect on you i know this movie is all make belive but you buy this plot into thinking it is a reality and you worry for these kids when u get deep into the film but thats my review scared shit less ha ha lol
Sep 7 2008,positive,i still defend this movie its got great atmosphere if you can get by the media hubbub surrounding it when i saw this in theaters in the 9th grade i thought it was just a horror movie and got what i expected the fact that i sent camping the next night has cemented it as one of the scarier movies ive seen
Sep 7 2008,negative,never really liked this and didnt see the big fuss made the whole video camera thing might be scarier but id rather have directors and movie cameras  a normal movie the ending was probably the most exciting part and then of courseit ended so
Sep 7 2008,positive,ok this was such a discovery for me one of the scariest movies ive ever seen minimalism of the production and unknown actors did paied out great creating a sticky athmosphere of scarefor sure blair witch redefined thrillers for good
Sep 7 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me i loved it i dont care that its fakle it was awesome believable performances too maybe due to the terrible qualtiy picture or something
Sep 6 2008,positive,omg i thot it was a real story i cudent go camping for the longest time
Sep 6 2008,positive,fuck this movive is scary n cool and its based on a true story damn
Sep 6 2008,positive,alot of people cant stand this movie i loved it
Sep 6 2008,positive,scaryim sooo bad at horror movies
Sep 5 2008,negative,waaaaaaaay overrated  this could have been awesome  40 minutes devoted to people asking wheres the fing map isnt exactly thrilling
Sep 5 2008,negative, 154 stars    part of the fun of this movie is trying to figure out whether or not any of this actually happened the film itself offers no answers as to what or who the blair witch is but i could see people becoming curious about the supernatural after seeing this movie of course its a big step to try to figure out what kind of supernatural occurences are real and which ones arent i guess thats just what i would want people to get out of the movie    i must admit when you get to the end you begin to wonder then if you watch the documentary that goes along with it youll be even more confused but sometimes confusing is fun really a fun movie but devoid of any legitimate meaning    shaffer system  technical excellence 1 star  validity 0 stars  worldview 12 star  contentvehicle incorporation 0 stars
Sep 4 2008,positive,overrated but still atmospheric and interesting horror movie mostly impressive in that it made 10000 for every 1 spent on production
Sep 4 2008,negative,frightened crap out of me
Sep 4 2008,neutral,crazy if it was real
Sep 3 2008,positive,i havent seen many horrorsuspense films i thought this was pretty scary
Sep 3 2008,negative,worst ending ever a total disappointment for all they hype it got
Sep 3 2008,neutral,one must recognize that this movie contributed to create a new subgenre the handcamera filmed movies the problem is that style extended to multyple of terrible films
Sep 3 2008,negative,sucked an spawned more sucky movies like cloverfield
Sep 2 2008,negative,this really sucks  enough said
Sep 2 2008,positive,the acting is actually pretty solid when they start fighting but its a one time scare that comes and goes after the first look
Sep 2 2008,positive,i for one was terrified
Sep 2 2008,positive,this is a really creepy film  the anoyin part is the camras move like crazy  other than that i enjoyed it
Sep 1 2008,positive,watched it when i was 20y almost peed in my pants i mean i took this movie really like a documentary awesome experience 
Aug 31 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me
Aug 31 2008,positive,i dont care what you say the first time watching it is very effective
Aug 31 2008,positive,okay ladies and gentlemen let the hate begin  much has been said about this movie most of it bad  having seen the film both before realizing it was a spoiler hoax and afterwards  i have come to the conclusion that this film is an expert undertaking in the art of psychological horror  those who argue that a movie is not scary unless you see the creaturestalkermonsteralien must not scare easily in the first place  i for one believe that the unseen has infinite possibilities of terror than some cg creature jumping at the screen  plus much of the movie is about the depressing low that being lost can bring you  its one thing to be trapped in a small cage with no apparent means of escape  you can accept your situation and start to evaluate options  but when you are trapped in a wide open area where escape is in every direction it becomes so hopeless that all you can do is hope to reach some sort of salvation before you expire from pure exhuastion or the elements of meance overcome  by the way the movie rules so all of you haters can suck it
Aug 31 2008,positive,i love this saw it before the hype ruined it and found it profoundly unsettling
Aug 30 2008,positive,ok so i saw this movie when i was younger and i thought it was rather dumb  but now that ive watched it again i was shaking slightly after watching it  horror movies dont usually scare me but this one did  there were no scary monsters or anything that jumped out but it was just the sound that made the movie so incredibly scary
Aug 30 2008,negative,gave me one hell of a headache
Aug 30 2008,positive,kind of neat at the time but i did get motion sickness watching it and on second glance the story was fairly week
Aug 29 2008,positive,thrilling like hell without any usage of blood and special effects excellent
Aug 29 2008,positive,i dizzy and threw up but it was a first so it was great
Aug 29 2008,positive,hey i saw this in a dark and crowded theater nobody in that room slept well that night one of the creepiest movies ive ever seen
Aug 29 2008,negative,really dull pants in fact
Aug 29 2008,positive,not as good as people said it would be but i like the way it ties togther i like the way it scares you its not scarey but at the same time your heart wont stop pounding but the method was very interesting i also enjoyed the documentary style storyline and filming techniques could have been a better movie though but definatly not bad
Aug 29 2008,negative,hate it i was so excited to see this movie back when it came out i followed the websites and everything for like six months before its release and then yeah theres nothing scary about this film whatsoever
Aug 28 2008,negative,the originl cloverfield
Aug 28 2008,negative,i fell asleep half way threw in the theaters
Aug 28 2008,positive,okay akash you need to stop giving hi five to every freaking movie that you see hmmm well a low budget movie can also also not only compete with these astronomical budget movies but even beat themvery frankly i would not have given it such high rating if it was a high budget movieits the efficiencyand a huge plus for the movie was that it did not scare the guts out of me as other scary movies alright if i dare to watch a scary movie it that does not mean that you make my next 10 nights sleeping with my lights onscare me little dammit     akash you need to stop your rambling and get on the pointthe movie i guess i would have preferred a happy ending or atleast one survivor who was best able to deal with the stressbutanyways    story 4 d  cinematography 4 d  direction 4  screenplay 4  acting 4  editing 45  music 4
Aug 28 2008,positive,if you found this movie not to be scary you must be retarded great maryland scenery
Aug 28 2008,positive,take it with a grain of salt its good for what it is basically like reading an issue of weird new jersey if you enjoy urban legends you should enjoy this
Aug 27 2008,positive,this movie left me with a trauma i like it horror and suspense from start to finish
Aug 27 2008,negative,didnt scare me i was so excited when this finally came to tv an my folks let me get it on ppv and was so disappointed that halloween night when i found out i would be more scared by nightmare on elm street even though i had seen it 15 times not scary not creative just plain and boring
Aug 27 2008,positive,very clever and original story pretty creepy when watched in the dark at night with sound turned up to the max would have liked it to be abit more scary with more detail but i like the whole simple documentary idea
Aug 27 2008,negative,nothing hapend it was a load of kids screaming at nothing
Aug 27 2008,positive,i wont lie i bought into the hype and had a jolly good time
Aug 27 2008,positive,oh cmon get real this is the best film out there and if it wasnt good to you then i dont know√¢ my fav film yet 
Aug 26 2008,positive,drip drip dripping of the infamous snot
Aug 26 2008,neutral,a reasonable premise and some ok character acting but budget limitations mean nothing actually happens in this movie and its not scary
Aug 26 2008,negative,absolutely awful film its amazing this made such an impact at the time thanks to good use of internet marketing absolutely terrible and unwatchable and really boring
Aug 26 2008,negative,selfinduced vertigo anyone what a piece of crap
Aug 26 2008,neutral,the ending made me want to take back that hour and a half that i wasted watching it  it built up really nicelybut crashed and burned at the end and i wasnt a huge fan of the girl filming herself toward the endit was very corny
Aug 26 2008,positive,its a good movie but only if youre keeping things to just watching it purely as it is without noting all the hype and expecting anything wont work and you wont find any kick in it if you dont seriously so watch it with an open mind and enjoy the ride
Aug 26 2008,positive,the first part was very well made it was very interesting filmed maybe not the scariest movie but still a good one
Aug 25 2008,positive,1999 not directly involved
Aug 25 2008,negative,1 myrick and sanchez both went to central florida in orlando it was there that the idea for a documentary thriller was conceived by watching in search of 1976 chariot of gods 19961997 and legend of boggy creek charles b pierce 1972 the original idea had been a pseudodocumentary filler where the narrator tied all police officers friends and family together    2 directors took method approach to acting by filming over 8 straight days 247 the actors in the woods were equipped with an old cp16mm and a high 8 video camera bought for 500 which was later returned to circuit city on a daily basis directors checked equipment and left a note with assigned duties 20 hrs footage cut to 25 hours    3 marketing filmmakers then ran a website  initially creating a stir with the public the film aired at sundance on january 23 1999 they had placed leaflets and small posters of 3 missing film students all over the utah city artisan entertainment was laughed at for picking the film up    4 what is american independent cinema microbudget movie grosses 145 million microbudget  35000 mostly to editing
Aug 25 2008,positive,i recetly watched this after a number of years and it is still a thrilling and rivetting film a truly classic horror film that ends abruptly but the creepyness of it all leaves its mark this is a very underated film and definatly deserves more respect from film fans for its originality and its effort in creating a horror film that doesnt rely on special efforts  gore
Aug 24 2008,positive,clasic  own camrea look
Aug 23 2008,neutral,i actually apreciate this movie now
Aug 23 2008,positive,this movie scared the crap out of me holy crap i think about this every time im in the woods
Aug 23 2008,positive,comic movies have reached their flourish recentlyhorror films lack of upgrade which is another reason to expect the inevitable comeback of the genreuntil thenblair witch strikes us with immeasurable anxiety and poignant fear in a turbulence environment ready to explode the emotions of the doomed group
Aug 22 2008,negative,i remember being angry at the end of this movie  angry about being out seven bucks  a decent premise
Aug 22 2008,positive,scary because it looks so real a documentary  very good movie 
Aug 21 2008,positive,i know it has gone down as a cheesy cliche but i didnt think it was bad  ending is a bit anticlimatic
Aug 21 2008,negative,seriously just watching the camera gave me motion sickness
Aug 21 2008,neutral,i found episodes of tales from the darkside and beyond belief fact or fiction creepier than this movie however it had an effective marketing campaign and was a good concept the camera work is pretty cool and a big influence on movies like cloverfield the micro budget doesnt show and the acting was actually done well and realistically mostly improv however there was not enough actual plot i dont need bloodgutscgiseeing a creepy monster but getting lost in the woods and finding kinda weird stuff on trees and the ground just isnt scary to me the sounds they were supposed to hear from their tent were barely audible and not creepy and if they walked for 15 hours a day from where they started in maryland they would end up at the white house as for the ending i am perfectly fine with leaving stuff up to the viewers imagination as long as enough of something is actually shown for the audience to think about like in 2001 if the ending did more to imply the possibility that they went insane and killed each other and there was never any witch i would have liked this movie more
Aug 21 2008,positive,the olny horror movie that really freaked meand the fact that i watched it alone at 2 am in the dark may of made me a little more twitchybut who knows
Aug 21 2008,positive,wtf i was scared haha
Aug 20 2008,negative,so overhyped i remember watching this in the theater on a rainy day and the power went out several times during the movie not that it took away from anything
Aug 20 2008,negative,gayest movie ever madesimply put
Aug 20 2008,neutral,ok  so it was an interesting concept whatever
Aug 20 2008,positive,the greatest hype ever pulled on moviegoers can you believe that morons thought this was actually real there is something to appreciate with the blair witch project and its not in the movie but rather in the marketing a cool concept doesnt seem remotely scary in the way that other ghost stories succeed in using your imagination crap camera work and huffing and puffing doesnt help to create fear the only time the movie has any momentum is towards the end and thats it i like the beginning documentary part of it and cant say that i hated the whole movie too much repetitiousness in conflict scenes of getting lost or dealing with heather
Aug 19 2008,negative,not scary wot so ever
Aug 18 2008,negative,the worst movie i have ever seenthe movie that left me angry because it was so bad
Aug 18 2008,positive,this was gooduntil i found out it was fake
Aug 18 2008,negative,this one sucked out loud   totally pointless and a complete   waste of time energy and 
Aug 18 2008,positive,i think its an aweome movie atypcal horor film  definitely one of my faves
Aug 18 2008,positive,theres nothing scarier than being lost in the woods at night nothing this movie basically bluffs its way through with a handful of nothing and i highly doubt it would be as effective on a second viewing but on a first watch its terrifying seeing a forest at night  through a camera lens the nearest trees too starkly white in the limitedrange light and the areas beyond falling into darkness anything could show up out of the black anything at all this movie wisely knows that our imaginations will take this scenario and run with it once again proving that what is not seen is scarier than what is shown the most intense parts of movies like rec and 28 weeks later have followed the example set here is it a good movie im not sure characters are broadly drawn do stupid things and argue like idiots but does it scare absolutely im actually surprised i dont see more love for this film
Aug 18 2008,positive,best idea for a movie ever
Aug 18 2008,positive,one of my favorite horrors i have respect for the people who can appreciate the movie and actually get it some people just need to see the boogeyman to be scared  the rest of us have working imaginationsthe people who love it are probably more artist type people and the people who hate are probably analytical and need answers to every question and dont recognize real art what they see it
Aug 17 2008,negative,i was on the brink of demanding a refund
Aug 17 2008,positive,loved itbut it made me mad when i found out they were just acting
Aug 17 2008,positive,it took me three attemps to watch this film all the way though
Aug 16 2008,positive,substantial horror film that works  perhaps the scariest things are those that we cant see or explain yet we can hear them out there lurking in the dark  avoid its ludicrous sequel
Aug 16 2008,negative,ten years after its release after almost the entire world is more than fully aware that the events in the film are fictitious it seems ridiculous to think this movie is even remotely frightening in fact watching it keenly aware of the filmmakers manipulation of the three actors it isnt scary at all donahues character is insufferably annoying in the beginning of the film and it is very easy to see how leonard and williams get fed up with her almost immediately i didnt have a problem with the jerky camera work i actually liked it and a lot of the acting if you can call it that is fantastic
Aug 16 2008,negative,very disappointingbut the hype was amazing and my hat is off to the makers of the film for turning such an incredible profit off of something i could have shot in my back yard
Aug 15 2008,negative,this is easily one of the worst movies ever made  if not the worst  it made my day to see these rotten jackasses all get what they deserved  crap  the half star is for the last five minutes of the movie  which were the only thing remotely enjoyable about it
Aug 15 2008,neutral,this movie was okay i neither hate it or love it i thought the absolute last scene was pretty good horror suspense not quite enough happened and they could have cut the first half of the movie down considerably none of the characters were slightly likable the famous im so scared scene is distractingly gross because you are seeing right up her nose even though paranormal activity borrowed heavily from it it was executed so much better
Aug 15 2008,negative,sorrywhy is wandering around in the woods scary
Aug 15 2008,positive,im a sucker for anticipation what can i say
Aug 15 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me i wish it would have shown a glimpse of the witch though
Aug 15 2008,positive,scared the peanuts out of my mms completely disturbing again because of what you dont see
Aug 14 2008,negative,pathetici ended up rooting for the witch
Aug 14 2008,positive,now im normally the first person to harp on anyone who claims that a movie has not aged well  but when talking about blair witch i myself am forced to say this about a movie that came out just a decade ago  at its heart blair witch is nothing but an interesting idea and some great marketing  im sure that when the movie came out and people were not really sure if this was real or not it had a lot more shock power but after it has become so mainstream it loses a lot of its edge  blair witch does have some redeeming qualities though  the acting is phenomenal all the emotion feels raw and unrestrained  in fact the same can be said about the camera work  another thing this movie gets right is something that has plagued horror movies since their inception the monster  there are many a great films that have fallen flat on their faces when they reveal the monster to be some guy in a cheesy rubber costume  blair witch was smart because they never reveal the witch  some people hated this but i feel that it leaves so much more to the imagination  so why the low score  because blair witch breaks the golden principle in movies storytelling  in the end it didnt matter how scary or surreal it was because the first hour  of running time is nothing  thats really the only way to say it nothing  no character development no strengthened bonds just mindmelting boredom  seriously if i wanted to watch a group of generation xers talking about their shitty lives i would just go hang out in the 711 parking lot  bad storytelling bad movie
Aug 14 2008,neutral,a couple of slightly creepy moments but nothing but overrated nonsense low budget and it definately shows by lacking in almost every area
Aug 14 2008,positive,im afraid to close my eyes im afraid to open them
Aug 14 2008,positive,people trash on it but i think its a unique and interesting way to make a horror film  not bad at all
Aug 14 2008,positive,a good horror film put youself into their shoes and tell me that you would not be freaked out the way that the film was shot and edited was something that we have never seen before and for this it made for a new type of film there was a good biuld up to the end much like the 1978 halloween and the cast was good ok maybe heather donahues charecter was a little anoying in places the film dont drag and for what it is there is not much wrong with it i mean you dont see anything but look at all the greats jaws halloween friday the 13th part one the shinning etc all great horror films with the best bits that show nothing
Aug 14 2008,positive,freaky ass movie but i wasnt scared no really i wasnt not at all
Aug 14 2008,positive,needed a bit more scary for me
Aug 13 2008,negative,this movie needed more action 25
Aug 13 2008,positive,freakin scary if you watch at my house and good acting 
Aug 12 2008,positive,if you have any sense in movies youll watch this and if the ending doesnt screw with your head you have no soul
Aug 12 2008,positive,lots of folks like to rag on this movie and i cant understand why is it the cheap look that was the point of the movie it proves what you dont see is most frightening and would you really say its so bad compared with its sequel
Aug 12 2008,positive,pretty novel  i wish idve seen it at the movie theaters so i could see what all the hype was about  not really scary but creepy enough
Aug 12 2008,positive,so scary its not even funny
Aug 12 2008,positive,interesting spooky in places
Aug 11 2008,positive,i havent seen this movie in years but i watched this when i was like 10 years old and i had nightmares for weeks and i was afraid of the dark for awhile this is the only scary movie thats freaked me out for weeks
Aug 11 2008,negative,saw this in theatre  biggest sucess in movie history as far as percentage grossed arguably the worst horror film ever made ugh
Aug 10 2008,positive,as bad as this movie was it was great  what a damned enigma   i have to give it a large rating for  being a pioneer and intelligent marketing  nearly all people who first saw it in theatre if even for a second questioned if it was real or not
Aug 10 2008,neutral,with a reputation that was built on hype alone and many saying how scary this flick is i found it to be a onetrick pony the opening and last five minutes are the best the rest is repetitive and boring anyone who thought this was real or a doco needs their head read
Aug 10 2008,positive,haha i found this movie really funny holy shit that pile of rocks wasnt there last night   i thought it was pretty good even though the ending kinda left me hangin i didnt like that too much but it got my imagination going
Aug 10 2008,positive,i was shaking so much while watching this
Aug 10 2008,negative,this movie is just a waste of time i dont know why so many people liked it its not even scary i had more chills watching zohan than this
Aug 9 2008,negative,what this is a scary movie  totally didnt think so p
Aug 9 2008,positive,an original frightening horror piece
Aug 9 2008,positive,this movie is hilarious and the ending even gave me chills unheard of for any horror movie however i was still disappointed that i wasnt scared this was the one movie that when i asked if it would scare me everyone agreed on i watched it at 2 in the morning with the lights off and everything nada
Aug 9 2008,negative,this could be the most overhyped movie ive ever seen in fact i found some of it quite scary in a dark theater but when you notice most of the silly behavior in the movie resembles squabbling from group nicotine cravings more than reactions to the paranormal well sayonara they run out of cigarettes in the woods if youve ever been a smoker or known one who was caught without cigarettes for a couple days youll recognize the kind of personal meltdown exactly
Aug 9 2008,positive,petrifying one of the most famous horror films of the 90s is also one of the scariest ever made not because it is manic with blood and gore or even a single sight of the creaturepersonghost doing the scaring but because it plays to our basic human fears as three young documentary filmmakers explore the woods for creepy footage to use in a film theyre making about the blair witch an unseen threat screams and makes noise and leaves ritualistic symbols outside their tent at night the jerky camerawork is a bravura masterstroke as is the skincrawling shot of the main protagonist delivering a tearstained snotnosed confessional directly into the camera the minimalist ending brutal
Aug 9 2008,positive,ow my god so scary
Aug 9 2008,positive,novel approach to filmmaking  worked this time for this movie
Aug 9 2008,positive,absolutely incredible completely original and perfect nothing like it definitely one of my most favourite movies of allllll time d
Aug 8 2008,negative,this film was very weird and i didnt really get it wtf happened at the end
Aug 8 2008,positive,this is one of the very few movies i have actually had shivers at the credits sure the acting was oksure the story was simplesure at times you wanted it to just end or do something but how would you act in swuch a situation if this were true probably much the same except i wouldve been dragging a cooler of beer behind me and my drunken ass wouldve been ready for battle the second i heard ghostly kids surround my tent anyway the final scene did give me the creeps just think if you had gone to the basement first what could possibly be sooooo scary to put you in a corner a grown man any doubt as you let your friend walk to her apparent death wouldnt you at least save her knowing you were to die yet something was so horrifying it made this adult turn to a child state and stand in the corner as if being punished makes me think much more than i probably should but still gives me the creeps just so damn sick of unoriginal over done hoyywood trying to scare us with another remake
Aug 8 2008,positive,this is a great movie to watch while camping
Aug 7 2008,positive,scary and original forces you to imagine half of the movie which is truly frightening
Aug 7 2008,positive,so this movie would be nothing too special except  it was so different from anything we had seen before it made you want to believe that it was real we hadnt seen a fake documentary like that in maybe ever and thats the genius it took us all by surprise we didnt know what to expect was it a real documentary and they were just all screwing with each other did they really want to market it as a documentary and so did some scary things to make it look better or was none of it planned was something going horribly wrong and we were getting a first hand account of several hikers dying in the woods you laugh at the idea that anyone could think it was real now but weve been through it all a few times now there was something so different about the blair witch project so absolutely unsettling that it could become difficult to decide whats a rational thought and whats not and remember all those years ago we were much younger when a 10 year old sees a camera moving like that they immediately think of their dads home videos there is no way for them to distinguish the two and decide that one of them is fake this film today is not anything special but thats because it was the one that changed things around its not special anymore because it set a standard of discomfort and uncertainty that proceeding movies could only ever hope to produce they never could of course because once you saw bwp everything was fake or was everything real until you decided that the movie would haunt you day after day after day there would be no escaping it if you let even a shred of doubt remain that it wasnt fake your gone because if its possible that this movie is real well then every movie could be real and we dont like the idea that the worst that we can dream up and put on a screen is real its too revolutionary not to give it a good score
Aug 7 2008,neutral,its alright but never has a pulse
Aug 6 2008,negative,i have to give it credit for being different but im still not a fan
Aug 6 2008,neutral,its ok the only reason i liked it was because the scary part all the rest is all introduction
Aug 6 2008,negative,omg this movie was so stupid i am so mad i wasted money on this movie
Aug 6 2008,positive,the blair witch project gave us a look at what people fear the mostthe things we cant see or understand is truly the most  scary
Aug 5 2008,neutral,i only saw this for the first time a few months ago it was what it was i guess
Aug 5 2008,positive,i originally saw this in the theater  everyone in the theater was at the edge of their seats freaking out jumping and gasping  and then they were pissed at the ending  hey folks if it freaked you out the movie did its job  i think this was an amazingly different movie when it came out
Aug 5 2008,positive,its good but i belive book of shadows is better
Aug 4 2008,positive,this was great  what are you people talking about
Aug 4 2008,positive,so creepy    especially when theyre sat in the tent and it starts shaking and all you can hear is childrens laughing and trees cracking
Aug 4 2008,positive,this scarred me for life
Aug 3 2008,positive,i loved this when it came out its kind of fucking retarded now
Aug 3 2008,negative,make yourself believe the movies real and it will at least be a little bit scary but its totally fake so
Aug 3 2008,negative,the only cool concept of this movie was the real footage of them shooting the film in the woods
Aug 3 2008,neutral,you know the part where nothing happens  thats the whole movie
Aug 2 2008,positive,i dont know why everyone thinks this movie is so scary sure it has its moments but i know people who didnt sleep for like a month after watching it
Aug 2 2008,negative,i spent the entire movie waiting for something scary to happen and nothing ever did  ya the guy was in the corner at the end but it didnt show anyone actually being killed or anything  and what was so scary about the twigs and rocks honestly  were they meant to symbolize something      this movie was a waste of time
Aug 2 2008,positive,a beautiful physiological thriller
Aug 2 2008,positive,made with 13000largest profit made from a movie ever brilliant
Aug 1 2008,positive,it could be better with something more terrorific things
Aug 1 2008,neutral,my version was better
Jul 31 2008,negative,scarynoi could do a better movie wiht my own camerawacht quarantine instead
Jul 31 2008,negative,give me a million and i can give you something like that too
Jul 31 2008,negative,fake as fuck i give it 12 a wormy apple
Jul 31 2008,negative,over rated pice of hype

Jul 31 2008,positive,scariest movie seen so far
Jul 31 2008,positive,scared the shit out of me
Jul 31 2008,positive,good the first time you see it  not really rewatchable though
Jul 31 2008,negative,oh noes it was realzorz
Jul 30 2008,positive,i thought this was real  they did a great job on this film
Jul 30 2008,positive,hey i liked it  even for the 5th time i still liked it blair witch was the topgrossing independent film of alltime so you must give it some credit
Jul 30 2008,positive,awesume effin movie heres why 1 the film doesnt use or need any music to raise the suspense 2 it is entirely shot with lower quality unstable cameras for authenticity 3 parts are left unseen to put your imagination to work
Jul 29 2008,neutral,a great theater going experience  second time around  not so good
Jul 29 2008,positive,scared the crap out of meif i had seen it when it came out and didnt know if it was real or not for a year i would have been scared out of my mind
Jul 29 2008,neutral,overrated then overrated now in other words boring
Jul 28 2008,positive,excellent pacing excellent acting excellent horror you really get the feel that this could be real and it leaves you feeling uneasy after watching it i think that this movie was a great take on horror movies and eerily chilling
Jul 28 2008,positive,if your looking for something different this movie is perfect for you god knows why i watched this movie it scared the shit out of me
Jul 28 2008,positive,heres the deal ive always said the scariest things are what you dont see  so many movies today show to much and they become ridiculous  this one however showed extremely little and the effect worked  if you want to see everything go watch freddy vs jason because thats probably more your style  while i wouldve loved more scenes like the last few nights in it and less daytime dialogue the film was excellent to me and many others  if you just want horror this is it  no slasher no monster and best of allno knowing what it is
Jul 28 2008,neutral,good for one view and one view only
Jul 28 2008,negative,one of the lamest ever
Jul 28 2008,positive,on first viewing this is a five just for the unique qualities but i recently tried to watch it again and thought it sucked  it was not something fun to watch again so that is why i gave it a 3
Jul 28 2008,negative,the last 30 seconds were the was crap
Jul 27 2008,positive,this movie gets shat on so hard  deservedly for all the money it made but undeservedly  so for the dudes involved
Jul 27 2008,positive,first time i saw iti believed it was for realha ha ha
Jul 27 2008,negative,jiggle cameraflashlight for lightinggame me a headache
Jul 27 2008,positive,i missed the blair witch hype i have only recently seen it i have to say i really like it wasnt the best movie i have ever seen but i was scared a lot freaked waiting and watching what was going to happen next i have spent some time in the woods and that seems like it would be so awful to be lost and freaked out like that a
Jul 27 2008,neutral,this is a good independant film when you first see it but can be boring if you watch it more than once i admire the concept for its originality and well thought out delivery its not what you see that scares you its what you dont
Jul 27 2008,positive,simply an experience you have to have the hype overexaggerates the final product but its still scarier than it looks
Jul 27 2008,positive,i thought it was good when i thought it was a true storylol
Jul 26 2008,positive,a great movierumor had it that this was an actual documentary  later you find out that they just had amazing actors 5 stars
Jul 26 2008,positive,this was pretty scary
Jul 26 2008,positive,movie scared the shit out of me
Jul 26 2008,negative,suckedi actully demanded and got my money back
Jul 26 2008,negative,i just didnt get it and never got as scared as everybody else in the theatre  i just couldnt understand all the hype
Jul 26 2008,positive,this is the best horror film ever  if you think about it you know this could really happen and thats what makes it a great movie
Jul 26 2008,negative,scared me bad when i was in highschool but overall not a good movie
Jul 26 2008,positive,this is only good and scary the first time you watch it then you start thinking about how stupid they were and youre not invested anymore
Jul 25 2008,positive,i dont care what others thought this was great no hollywood glitz and glamour here just indie at its best for thriller
Jul 25 2008,positive,scary scary endingit gave me chills for a week
Jul 25 2008,neutral,thiught it was based on a real story and just about shit myself
Jul 25 2008,negative,what a letdown the only thing that scared me was the very last scene
Jul 25 2008,positive,you can tell its fake but i liked it
Jul 25 2008,positive,i live in front of a cemetery and a forest so things dont usually creep me out but this one just kinda made me nervous i hike a lot and so does my family but the actual running around and screaming shit didnt phase me i think it was just the thought of sick fucks in the forest i found myself frequently asking when is one gonna die but i suggest watching it just to complete your list of movies seen
Jul 25 2008,positive,the most misunderstood film of all time  time and time again i hear people say the same things about the movie  well they just walk around in the woods  its so boring  these people not only misunderstood the film but likely cant appreciate a lot of horror films  the movie is all about the little subtle moments of terror and its laced with those throughout the film  the camera techniques used in the film were extremely inventive and influenced a whole slew of other future films see cloverfield  the film had one of the cheapest budgets of all time for a major film and did sensationally well at the box office  the film generates terror for only those people smart enough to accept the film for what it is  its jumpoutofyourseat scary but only if you pay close attention to the little things  you have to immerse yourself in the story  let the camera and actors do the work for you  if you cant connect with the story or characters the film would be incredibly boring but whose fault is that  this is an intricate horrifying film that sends a chilling sensation down your spine each and every time if you can appreciate it  i think the problem most people face is that they have been babied by the blockbuster films of our days which spell everything out and tell you what you should be afraid of  it takes a special person to appreciate this film and if you cant well then you need to ween yourself off of major hollywood films and think for yourself a bit  harsh but true
Jul 25 2008,negative,i could not stand the shaky cam it made me sick and gave me a head ache i personally like the second one alot better
Jul 24 2008,positive,i liked the movie for the way it is takenit is not the conventional way a movie was shot ever  story sound effects were ok ending also was finebut still something was missing and i am not able to figure this out
Jul 24 2008,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen
Jul 24 2008,negative,boring movie characters are annoying ending is the only halfway decent part of the film
Jul 23 2008,neutral,i was highly disappointed with this movie  i wanted it to be the scariest thing that i have ever seen but it was highly boring  im pretty sure that they gave a credit to the woods because you see more of the trees than the three actors  obviously however this was a monumental point in a moviemaking view because this was the first of its kind  without the blair witch project we might not have had movies like cloverfield which i believe is one of the best movies to come out recently  overall this is a mustsee if you are interested in movie history but its a highly boring hourandahalf
Jul 23 2008,positive,still the scariest movie with no special effects blood or gore out there
Jul 23 2008,positive,the movie itself aint spectacular or terrifying but the acting is impeccable if i didnt kno better and someone told me this was real id believe them the shaky camera things did irritate some ppl nd u kno wat get ovr it it added to the effect and though it wasnt scary it was creepy it was also original
Jul 23 2008,positive,unbeleavable  a bunch of leaves grass and treas and it scared the living daylights out of me
Jul 23 2008,neutral,it seemed fake ta me scary tho
Jul 22 2008,positive,the characters get on my nerves something fierce but the ending is about as creepy as it gets
Jul 22 2008,neutral,not as cool as i thought it would be
Jul 22 2008,negative,stupid  there is no other word to describe this movie if you can call it a movie  it was pure cinematic garbage
Jul 21 2008,positive,no i guess its not your everyday scary movie but if you really get into it it chills you to the bone man whew
Jul 21 2008,positive,i hated this film  it ran at the theater i was working at forever  in theory its decent and the execution wasnt bad  but it was overhyped and not comparable to the hype it allotted  think how much i recommend people see fight club and apply it to a movie like boondock saints that bad
Jul 21 2008,positive,although it owes something to cannibal hollacaust one of the best horror films of the 90s great web site too baghead is a pale imitation
Jul 21 2008,negative,rubbish very disappointing
Jul 21 2008,positive,this movie is just effin awesome no matter what anyone says i know that it is 
Jul 21 2008,negative,come on get fuckin real
Jul 21 2008,positive,good the first time  doesnt hold up to repeat viewings but once is great
Jul 21 2008,neutral,first vhs ever purchased lol
Jul 21 2008,positive,this movie scared the crap out of me more than halfway home from the theater  i knew it was fake but i was able to lose myself in it  i recently watched it with my wife because she had never seen it before  it was almost as creepy this time as it was in 1999
Jul 21 2008,negative,a huge disappointment actors are rather good but this movie is empty instead of this movie i recommend you rec which is really scary
Jul 21 2008,negative,oh god saw this in theatres too
Jul 20 2008,positive,scared me half to death the first time i watched it my mom told me it was a true story grrr
Jul 20 2008,negative,this movie sucks balls
Jul 20 2008,positive,okay i admit it scared me lol
Jul 20 2008,neutral,overrated but pretty good
Jul 20 2008,positive,it was interesting but it wasnt all that scary
Jul 20 2008,positive,an original and simple idea made into an excellent and highly unnerving experience
Jul 20 2008,positive,scary as heck i saw this in the movies then on vhs cant wait for the bluray
Jul 19 2008,positive,watch it on dvd with the directors commentary  turns it into a comedic filmschool instructional over a few beers
Jul 19 2008,neutral,this was a very good movie but it was just ahead of its time i loved it when it came out but now im not sure
Jul 19 2008,positive,scared the hell out of me during 1st viewing original yet simple a great horror
Jul 18 2008,positive,incredible one of my absolute favorites hands down the scariest movie ive ever seen the cinemetography is complete genius as well as the script choice of cast just everything so realistic you feel like youre in the woods with them
Jul 18 2008,positive,this film makes me start watching indie movies 
Jul 18 2008,positive,unique and unforgettable spin on the horror movie rough around the edges but thats the secret of its success the ending was too subtle for the powersthatbe originally but neither of the alternative endings would have worked so well
Jul 18 2008,negative,if you think this is real it might be better  by the time i saw this the main girl was doing the mtv video awards the whole point is that its suppose to be real without that this movie doesnt have much going for it  one person i talked to was scared but only at the end
Jul 18 2008,positive,that will creeep u out seriously
Jul 18 2008,negative,not scary at all and and its like an hour to get to the scary parts that are not even scary the scary parts were screams in the woods which you could barely here and piles of rocks movin from one place to another not a very good movie
Jul 17 2008,positive,alot people i talk to either hate this movie or think its really good i love it the thought of making a scary movie through a normal camera view is cool and its suspenseful and sorry but they dont show you the witch which is another great suspenseful scene  it just keeps you at the edge of your seat and its my favorite scary movie
Jul 17 2008,negative,what a load of crap
Jul 17 2008,positive,it was kinda slow going in the beginning i wasnt really scared during the movie until the last scene showing mike standing in the corner gave me chills i was kinda confused after the movie though was the blair witch doing all the scary stuff or was it the guy who killed the 7 kids or was the man actually the blair witch had to go online to figure it out maybe i just wasnt paying enough attention during the movie
Jul 17 2008,negative,it was so creepy that i didnt dare to watch the full movie
Jul 16 2008,positive,holywhat is this are these rocks what did that crazy old woman say about piles of rocks  i wasnt listening to her because i thought she was a lunatic i laughed for hours lol the ending is pretty creepy and the movie is amazingly well done despite it all being a load of crap i found it to be really fun and a little hairraising to watch 
Jul 16 2008,negative,why i wasted a spot on my netflix queue for this movie  i will never know  boring
Jul 16 2008,negative,theres a reason why the filmmakers have never worked in this or any town again because this was the most overhyped piece of schlockcinema to come around in a long time     i wont disparage the production values of this film i know what its like to work on a lowno budget project you can be artful and creative given any budget that is if you have the talent to do so     basically what this movie is to me is three white people screaming at each other in the woods this is not acting not even close     this film operates on a gimmick a gimmick i refuse to buy
Jul 16 2008,neutral,  i like cloverfield  more than blair witch project    because in the whole film  80 minutes  i can not see the blair witch 
Jul 16 2008,positive,idk if it was real or not but who cares its was freaky especially the ending
Jul 15 2008,negative,the vast majority of blair witch is boring the characters annoyed me terribly at times i gave the movie two stars mostly for its social impact
Jul 15 2008,positive,one of the best suspense movies ive ever seen it reminded me of classic hitchcock films that understood that you can imagine far scarier things than can be put on screen brilliant
Jul 14 2008,positive,i thought it was pretty interesting the whole thing was pretty scary and intense but the ending really disappointed me
Jul 14 2008,negative,god this was the worst movie ever
Jul 14 2008,positive,i hadnet seen this one until i came up here but it is prettty scary the first time you watch it
Jul 14 2008,positive,i like how you never really see anything but a bunch of sticks and rocks the fear of the unknown is always the scariest and i imagine when in theaters making people nauseous by running around with cameras added to the effect
Jul 14 2008,negative,i felt like i was on a really bad amusement park ride
Jul 14 2008,positive,i waz kinda scared and usaly movies dont scare me one bit

Jul 13 2008,positive,this is a great movie with a stupid ending i was pretty disappointed 
Jul 13 2008,negative,horrible pathetic storyline incoherant drunken camera work
Jul 12 2008,negative,i thought this was pretty stupid not scary at all kinda made me laugh cause it was so stupid and the ending  leaves you so confused
Jul 12 2008,positive,interesting and kinda creepy but not as scary as i thought it would be
Jul 12 2008,positive,i was waiting for something to jump outappear especially while heather was apologising but alas nothing did even after the credits i still want to figure out what was in wrapped up inside the bunch of sticks and what all those wooden sticks meant
Jul 12 2008,positive,it works although its less scary than the hype would suggest not as good as evil dead but much better than cannibal holocaust deserves credit for making independent cinema relevant for mainstream audiences again
Jul 11 2008,positive,32 stars practically filmed in someones backyard but what makes this movie intense isnt the effects its the fact that the fear in the actors eyes is real the last sequence in the film is much more impressive and unsettling than the last sequence of cloverfield
Jul 11 2008,negative,omg dont get me started on this movie i thought it was kinda scared throughout the movie because i thought the film was actually real but then when i find out its not it just makes it a dumb boring movie
Jul 11 2008,positive,i saw 15 minutes of it and it was ok
Jul 11 2008,neutral,the concept is brilliant and was worth the time but not a memorable film
Jul 11 2008,neutral,i did not like it so much i did not even finish it
Jul 11 2008,positive,it was okthe screen was pretty small and most of it was boring
Jul 10 2008,negative,this was not as scary as i had thought it was supposed to be back in the day  actually there is more guts and gore on most tv shows nowadays on law and order bones and er
Jul 10 2008,positive,this is my favorite horrorand i love horror 
Jul 10 2008,positive,i was surprisingly impressed with how realistic the acting was it actually deserves some awards but alas did not get any overall not scary so much as weird
Jul 10 2008,negative,saw it hated it like i hate all scary movies
Jul 10 2008,neutral,seen bits and pieces of this one
Jul 10 2008,positive,this film scared the shit out of me its definitely what you dont see that makes the film terrifying i dont think the fact that its not true should have an effect on ones view of the film because it feels completely realistic throughout the final scene is definitely the scariest scene ive ever witnessed in a film my heart was pounding right up until the credits started rolling
Jul 10 2008,positive,not bad made in maryland
Jul 10 2008,positive,managed to miss this hobgoblin of film that made everyone that saw it nauseous have seen it in pieces since and can see the point and even accept the jostling camera pov as a cool technique
Jul 8 2008,neutral,mildly amusing but mostly boring
Jul 8 2008,positive,ok fo those of us who spent alot of time camping in our youth this is actually amazingly scary
Jul 8 2008,positive,the most frightening film i have ever seen i still cant watch this movie by myself i think i actually cried a little the first time i saw it because i was young and in its way it forces you to confront the powerlessness of childhood its not just about the supernatural its about the despair and complete vulnerability of being lost in the middle of nowhere surrounded by an endless darkness creeping in on you its not that its just spooky in the moment which it is its that there is a deeper psychological fear being explored the almost universal fear of being alone lost and hunted dont believe people who say it sucks the reason they dont like it is because not everything is thrown at you it actually trusts the audience to use their imagination to fill in the blanks but god damn yeah its the real deal
Jul 8 2008,neutral,in 1999 it was slightly original thanks to the rumor mills since then it became boring
Jul 8 2008,negative,overhyped like the beatles
Jul 8 2008,positive,scary because of its unwillingness to show the us what is stalking the characters it also really examines the disorientation and frustration that arises when one is lost
Jul 8 2008,positive,i dont care what you think i thought it was terrifying
Jul 8 2008,positive,got drunk while watching
Jul 8 2008,negative,the most overrated unique piece of shite i have ever had the misfortune to sit through
Jul 7 2008,positive,if godard had directed friday the 13th
Jul 7 2008,negative,this is a dumb movie
Jul 7 2008,positive,creepy as freakin hell
Jul 7 2008,positive,this movie was actually a lot scarier than i thought it would be stunning made my heart pound like it was going to come out of my chest
Jul 7 2008,neutral,its really not that bad its just not terribly good either
Jul 7 2008,positive,seeing this film when it came out in a packed theater is still one of the most memorable moviegoing experiences ive had  my score is based on that initial viewing  as a side note this was really the first movie to effectively utilize the viral marketing concept  the anticipation level for the movie was really unusual for a film at its budget level
Jul 7 2008,neutral,i think i liked the idea of this movie more than the actual film it was so groundbreaking when it came out a decade ago but now weve seen films like cloverfield district 9 and paranormal activity use the same technique much more effectively the pay off at the end of the movie was pretty satisfying but during the journey to get there i found myself incredibly annoyed by the main female character its definitely a mustsee for anyone who claims to be culturally literate but it really doesnt stand the test of time
Jul 7 2008,negative,the most overrated and overhyped film i have ever seen like watching a two hour movie where nothing happens when a couple of drunks drop acid and go to the woods and get paranoid from stories they heard then nothing happens at the end someone stands in a corner very very scary
Jul 7 2008,positive,this movie is freakin scary
Jul 7 2008,negative,a worthless piece of crap
Jul 7 2008,negative,a bag of hot air and a load of hype turned this amateur looking movie fright piece into a sensation without even delivering the goods in the end somehow everyone seemed duped by the documentary style ad campaign claiming it was real strange gaffs how did that camera battery last for over 14 hours how did they get spares how could they really film and be freaked out at the same time and when the woods dont really scare some audience goers how can it really be scary made for fun parodies though until a slew of dumb parodies came out
Jul 7 2008,positive,loooove the blair witch i thought it was scary as hell in fact it is pretty much the last movie to actually scare me i love horror even when i dont get scared which is usually but the blair witch scared me even on my second watch it did the ending is awesome and i love this movie definitly a must see
Jul 7 2008,neutral,you know what fair enough essentially nothing happens but the abrupt ending is mildly creepy and kudos to anyone who can spend the hollywood equivalent of no money on a movie combine it with  documentary and website that makes out its real fools thousands and makes infinity billion dollars
Jul 6 2008,negative,was this really all that scary
Jul 6 2008,positive,its the freakiest horror movie i have ever seen
Jul 6 2008,positive,i think that if you get into the story as one of the members of the documentalyou can get scared easily
Jul 6 2008,negative,not scary at all really crap
Jul 5 2008,positive,kinda cheesy but a little scary but probably was better in its hayday
Jul 4 2008,positive,i loved this movie when it came outsomething about it just scared the shit out of me
Jul 4 2008,positive,seeing this after seeing cloverfield cloverfield was a poor imitation  and im guessing it cost a ton more
Jul 4 2008,negative,one of the biggest disappointments ever
Jul 4 2008,positive,silly as it seems it was scary and i liked it  i dont think id watch it again though
Jul 3 2008,positive,good and scary but im not totally convinced that its true
Jul 3 2008,positive,great once  i saw it at cinemapolis when it first came out and i totally thought it was real and you know how the bathrooms are in that theatre  yikes terrifying
Jul 3 2008,positive,cannot get enough of it
Jul 3 2008,positive,original but i think everyones let down by how it was brilliantly hyped  wasnt true
Jul 3 2008,negative,grossly overrated the best horror is able to scare you despite being a movie the instant you realize this is a movie it completely loses any power it might have had while its true that whats unseen can often be scarier than what it seen seeing three fucknuts wander around the forest screaming at each other and dropping snot rockets on the camera for ninety minutes while they get taunted by stick figures only inspires a fear of boredom
Jul 2 2008,neutral,well wasnt scary and the only thing that tried makin it scary was how they said it was the film of the missing people but they were actors and they were good and all but the movie just wasnt as good as i was expecting it to be so i was depressed in the outcome of this movie
Jul 2 2008,negative,wtf this movie pissed me off
Jul 2 2008,positive,the suspense is brilliant the character development in regards to them losing their minds is also brilliant
Jul 2 2008,positive,i dont care what anyone else says this movie was highly original and scary as hell
Jul 2 2008,negative,yes it was stupidi found that there was a little too much of just them screaming at eachother i mean yeah we get it they are in pissy moodsthe ending was kinda good maybe it just seemed that way after the rest of the movie loli didnt find it horriblejust could have been better if they changed a few thingsmore of a comedy than scary though there we a couple of parts that were like uhh wtflike the kids hitting the tentthat was weird and kind of creepy
Jul 2 2008,positive,my now husband showed this to me the night before i went camping in the woods on a mountain
Jul 2 2008,positive,oh man this film is one of the most funniest films ive ever watched though i cant say much for it on the idea of it being a frightening film it didnt make me jump but there were many people who were said to be pretty frightened i didnt see it as that kind of film especially when mike admits to kicking the map in the river i died laughing i think it was a great film that just proved you never need to see the killer and still it strikes terror into anyone who decides to venture into the woods the blair witch project was a fivestar all the way in my book
Jul 1 2008,negative,worst movie i have seen in my entire life a blind and deaf man with half an arm and a team of monkeys could make a better movie that this
Jul 1 2008,neutral,youll either love it  or hate it can only recommend you see this on the big screen is somewhat lacking watching it at home on your 32 widescreen tv
Jul 1 2008,negative,worst thing ive ever seen and how did it scare anyone
Jul 1 2008,neutral,credit given for the sheer effort that went into creating the history of he legend
Jun 30 2008,positive,fear is what you cannot see but know is there  i loved it
Jun 30 2008,positive,im sad its not real that would be cool
Jun 30 2008,positive,a very clever film really impressive but at times a bit boring
Jun 30 2008,negative,wasnt particularly scary when it first came out  i doubt it is any scarier now  watch cannibal holocaust instead
Jun 30 2008,negative,cant believe i paid to watch this
Jun 30 2008,positive,instant classic its rather scary there is a lot of profanity and bits of violence and gore the only thing you should worry about is the profanity
Jun 29 2008,positive,if they hadnt tried to do the first person cam in this one diary of the dead would not have been able to perfect it
Jun 29 2008,positive,tell me where you are josh  ive watched this about 50 times   instant classic and proof of my crap taste in film 
Jun 28 2008,positive,the second one is better
Jun 28 2008,positive,pretty good original
Jun 28 2008,negative,why was this supposed to be scary
Jun 27 2008,positive,loevd it scared the shit out of me
Jun 27 2008,negative,i was confused and it made me nauseous
Jun 27 2008,positive,i think this is a product of a creative ideas excellent marketing and superb coordination between the director and the actors it managed to bring across terror horror and emotional responses regardless of the lowbudget it broke the common idea that special effects and graphics are very essential in a modern horror the ending is brilliant and could not have been better
Jun 27 2008,positive,while its not a new horror masterpice its a well done attempt at a new type or brand of filmaking with great acting and decent sound effects this movie has in own way a different way to scare people unlike slasher films that seem to be realesed it always healthy to try somthing different
Jun 26 2008,positive,like a lot of things its just not cool to like this movie anymore but hey who said i cared what everyone else thinks
Jun 26 2008,negative,kill me im retarded stuck in the woods cant hold a camera and im making you pay to watch it
Jun 26 2008,neutral,ehhhh so so didnt think it lived up to the hype
Jun 26 2008,positive,ok i know a lot of people hated this mocie didnt think it was scary i myself was scared by it creeped out i know nothing really happens you see nothing you never see the witch or killer but its just plain creepy i do a lot of stuff out the woods hiking camping and biking and whenever im out i think of this movie say what you want but i was scared of this movie
Jun 26 2008,positive,the movie starts out very slow but its worth it to get to the end however throughout the movie the night scenes remain to be pretty intense
Jun 25 2008,negative,the snot coming out of the nose kinda turned me off
Jun 25 2008,positive,if you can get past listening to that incredibly irritating heather donahue the whole movie then you can love this movie
Jun 25 2008,negative,i watched about 45 minutes of this movie and then changed the channel not very exciting
Jun 25 2008,negative,i voluntarily watched this movie despite knowing the premise  storyline the scifi channel internet and movie plants led to great early  prerelease buzz in retrospect its the mother of all reality shows
Jun 25 2008,positive,pretty messed up movie
Jun 25 2008,positive,it scared the shit out of my friend so much she was under the covers and shivering god it was hilarious and freakishly good 
Jun 25 2008,positive,this is one of those corney movies you watch but dont get nothing out of itthe strange part is you find yourself watching it to the end anyway
Jun 25 2008,positive,why this film gets so much hate is beyond me in an age where computer generated imagery gorefests and lame convoluted storylines are needed to bring out the scares the blair witch project reverts back to the most simple of concepts pure terror you dont need to see the witch to be scared turn out the lights sit down and enter the woods with the gang you will be frightened you will feel their fear and youll also experience the most orignal and well made horror film to come along in a long long time the simple story coupled with the extremely real feel of the flick combined with its chilling conclusion make the blair witch project a fivestar winner
Jun 25 2008,positive,scared the shit outta me
Jun 25 2008,positive,it was ok not that scary though
Jun 24 2008,neutral,im kind of surprised by the backlash this movie gets a ton of people went to see it and bought into its back story once people started realizing it was all fake this movie got a ton of flack i think it was a very creative marketing and filming technique theres no wonder this movie made a ton of money
Jun 24 2008,negative,not good at all ending wasnt even all that great
Jun 23 2008,positive,really good until you realize its fake
Jun 23 2008,negative,sorry guys and galsnot scary to me the movie got on my nerves more than any other emotion it was too annoying to be scary
Jun 23 2008,positive,got me scared for weeks after first watching it and even if the second view was not as terrifying you have to love finding out about the secrets hidden behind all the tiny details the wood figures the piles of pebbles the teeth a very nice surprise when it came out and still a reference nowadays
Jun 23 2008,positive,fine acting by an unknown cast and ingenious use of setting and low budget props make for a classic horror film
Jun 23 2008,positive,this is creepy i love this movie
Jun 22 2008,positive,i know im going to get a lot of flak for this one let me start out by saying the 5 star rating is pertaining to this movie within the horror genre sorry jenn i have a feeling that statement is gonna turn your stomach as opposed to comparing with all the other movies ive seen as far as horror goes this one took the cake for me it scared the crap out of me and still does i knew it wasnt based on a real event like they wanted you to think when it came out but it didnt matter the actors didnt feel like actors they didnt talk like they were memorizing lines and if i didnt know any better i would have thought it was real footage i guess thats the point most people would probably say theres only a couple scary parts the tent the ending but i very much beg to differ i think everything from scene 1 onward contributes to the feeling of uneasiness and terror of the woods unlike most horror movies the scariness of this movie sinks in very slowly you arent even aware youre scared out of your pants until you realize youve slowly been cowering or tightening your grip on whatever chair youre in the tent scene just reassures you that yes you were right the first time you should be scared off your balls if you arent by now the ending just takes that feeling and drives it home to leave you looking quite stupid if someone were to have taken a picture of you at that exact moment    in conclusionthis movie scares you in the worst way possible by doing a total mindjob on you at least it did for me if youve seen this movie already im sure you have your own opinion on it if you havent its definitely worth seeing if for no other reason than to weigh your opinion against mine
Jun 22 2008,negative,sort of effective contains some really frightening scenes but a bit of a mess
Jun 22 2008,positive,real freakyhorror stuffat least for mebesides this movie won me a mini dv camcoder from sony
Jun 21 2008,negative,stupid stupid stupid this has to be the lamest movie i have ever seen its just somebody with a video camera walking around in the woods holding it up to their face the whole time screaming in just about every close up you see snot running down her nose too and its disgusting scary hell no anything is scarier than this shit the only reason i gave it a full star is because it was innovativeno other reason i guess they tried to make it scary and whateverbecause some people thought it was i dont see how you never see the thing thats after them but whatever at least it invented a new way of filmingi thought cloverfield was awesome  oh and about the budget i respect what they were trying to do but im not going to pity them just bc they didnt have a good budget
Jun 21 2008,positive,fun movie genuinely creepy with no gore money shots
Jun 21 2008,positive,a wonderful movie in the subject of horror
Jun 21 2008,neutral,deny the hype and save your motion sickness meds for another day
Jun 21 2008,positive,freaky the first time u watch it
Jun 21 2008,positive,the blair witch project  action horror  1999  rated r  running time 86 minutes  starring heather donahue josh leonard mike williams  directed by daniel myrick eduardo sanchez  rating 7 out of 10  outline  three student film makers head into the woods in search of a creepy legend  review  a film is found about three amateur film makers who headed out to a supposedly haunted woods near burkittsville maryland they were shooting a documentary film on a local legend called the blair witch the film is pretty unique as it is shot entirely in the first person perspective allowing for a sense of realism that very few horror movies can achieve the film starts off with the three film makers which consist of one girl and two guys preparing for their journey to shoot this film they head cross the state and as they get closer and closer to the woods they start to interview people about the local legend of blair witch the film does a great job of building the suspense and although completely fictional the film does a great job of actually making you think you are watching a real life movie the film with its slow build up and nice real life additions like a stay at a hotel before entering the woods and them shopping for supplies builds the story very well the interviews set the stage as some people think it is all a hoax and other people seem frightened just even speaking of it the funny thing about the legend is just like a giant game of broken telephone the story seems different and yet no less creepy from person to person they enter the woods to little fanfare and film a portion of the film at an apparent sight of a grizzly murder the legend seems the last thing on the filmmakers minds as they make camp for the night and joke and play around like not a care in the world as they head farther and farther into the wood they realize they are lost and they start to notice weird things like piles of rocks and other signs this is where the film really starts to work its magic on the second night of camping they start to hear weird noises all around the tent with falling rocks and footsteps seeming to come from everywhere if you have ever gone camping in a remote area the mind is the scariest part about camping and in this film is no different you do not see anything but the noises combined with the imagination leave a very unsettling feeling the longer they stay out in the woods the more and more precarious the situation becomes the three of them start bickering and yelling at one another and creepier and creepier images keep being found an example of this is when they come across put together stick people hanging in the trees the acting is well done and their fear is palpable and the sense of hopelessness is very prevalent by the end of the film you have felt you have gone on this journey with them as every night fall you are bombarded with eerie noises and frightening scenarios the films end is fantastic and without giving anything away it will leave you mortified and probably it will take you some time to enter an unknown or known wood for that matter as this film will impact you that much not relying on the usual gore of todays typical horror film the blair witch project never the less delivers one of the scarier performances of the last twenty years i give this movie my recommendations as its suspense and use of the viewers imagination was a treat to behold and it will keep you on the edge of your seat the further they get into the forest    t factor  if you have been in remote forests before then this could score higher on the rating scale    t factor √¢ do not movies filmed in the first perspective then this could score lower on the rating scale    if you liked this film reel recommendations fire in the sky or signs
Jun 21 2008,neutral,not as good as people said it was

Jun 16 2008,positive,though i dont like handheld cameras makes the screen move all the time this is a mustsee horror film one of those rare lowbudget classics

Jun 16 2008,positive,i loved this scared the crap out of me  i still thought it was real when i saw it
Jun 16 2008,positive,not the regular horror movie this movie has actually shown how a ghostly scenario would actually exist in reality very well made and made as realistic as possible    thats whats different in this movie watch it alone at night
Jun 16 2008,negative,kids are lost in the woods girls runs around crying about it  they find an old house go upstairts  when they come down one of them is having a pee in the corner  film ends    complete and utter garbage
Jun 16 2008,positive,its very good with its limitations but not worth all the hype it had on its initial release  scary but not terrifying
Jun 16 2008,positive,awesome acting performances the characters are all very realistic as well as their behavior and actions i could really feel the despair of the situation   the story is simple but they used it very well my jaw literally dropped a couple of times while watching  the movie is very authentic looking as well as atmospheric and creepy  the only real complaint i have is the sudden ending

Jun 14 2008,positive,i really liked this film  its funny i find this one really scary whereas most people i ask dont and i dont find the majority of horror films scary  i suppose its the power of suggestion and the way in which it asks you to use your own imagination rather than making it obvious to you whats going on as most horrors do that makes it scary    either way i love the first person camcorder idea and the way in which it shows the gradual decline of their spirit and selfcontrol superb acting great film
Jun 14 2008,positive,a good movie with scary moments
Jun 14 2008,positive,looksticksthe horror
Jun 14 2008,negative,this movie sucked plain and simple maybe i would have liked it if i watched it when it first came out or i actually believed it was real
Jun 14 2008,positive,saw this opening night way back when  was not impressed then but three weeks later in a dark wooded area i shit my pants only then did the true power of the film come to me
Jun 14 2008,negative,i might have expected too much because of all the hype surrounding this movie and its cult following but i didnt think it was very good    first of all it wasnt the least bit scary and isnt that the whole point of a scary movie    anyway i thought the movie was pretty boring until the very end everything just seemed unnecessarily long and dragged out it only really picked up in the last few minutes or so but by then it was wayyy too little too late i had to struggle to stay awake to watch this it wasnt engaging or interesting at all    besides that the girl annoyed me a lot i was practically rooting for whatever was out there to kill her i was a little disappointed she didnt die first mike was pretty stupid too what kind of sane guy who is lost throws away a map ehh whatever    it seemed like most of this movie was showing the three main characters whining and arguing and it didnt make for a very interesting movie
Jun 13 2008,neutral,i expected this movie to be awful people make fun of this all the time but honestly not that bad dont get me wrong ive seen better but it was very creative
Jun 13 2008,negative,this was so stupid and fake on top of that sorry no
Jun 13 2008,negative,now this is possibly the greatest waste of time the best thing about this film which i just found out right now is that the actors in it have very similar names bob griffin and bob griffith that must have got confusing when they were filming it hey bob no bob g griff meh the fat one
Jun 13 2008,positive,pretty creepyeven though its a totally mockumentary
Jun 13 2008,positive,hearing all the warnings that this movie was hilariously stupid and not scary at all i was prepared to have some dandy moviebashing  however i found that it was actually quite compelling except for some boring parts in the middle i would even say that the last five minutes of the movie are some of the craziest and most genuinely terrifying that ive seen in a while  better than cloverfield actually
Jun 13 2008,positive,landmark mock documentary that shows absolutely nothing but scares the heck out of you
Jun 13 2008,positive,a horror film that demonstrates that its what you dont see is whats scary
Jun 13 2008,negative,stupid overated overhyped
Jun 13 2008,positive,this was truly a love it or hate it i enjoyed it and i dont care what anyone says
Jun 12 2008,negative,i remember watching this really creepy
Jun 12 2008,positive,greatness in that i watch it knowing fullywell what is going to happen and yet i still get caught up in  the noises and that is a great movie setup
Jun 12 2008,negative,oh no theres going to be a crappy squeal ahhhh lol
Jun 12 2008,positive,i loved it when it first came out the style of the movie is brilliant making it feel that its real and not made up
Jun 12 2008,positive,five stars at the timebut after so many ripoffs and spoofsjust doest hack it anymorethe spoof doc on the dvd is better
Jun 12 2008,neutral,blah didnt follow the hype
Jun 12 2008,negative,sorry but i think its kind of stupid
Jun 11 2008,positive,dude watch this in the dark its better
Jun 11 2008,positive,to me this is the scariest movie ever
Jun 11 2008,positive,i dont care what people say it was an interesting movie
Jun 11 2008,negative,fucking snooze one of the first dvds i ever owned also one of the first dvds i ever sold on ebay along with go and american pie stinker
Jun 11 2008,neutral,considering what it was i guess it wasnt half bad however i was really expecting a scary movie in fact i scare easily and was told that it was a pretty scary movie since i know how easily i scare i actually forced my dear mother to watch this movie with me guess what its not scary im not saying that you shouldnt see it or that its just plain awful just dont expect to be creeped out by this movie
Jun 10 2008,neutral,only effective upon first veiwing and probably in 1999
Jun 10 2008,positive,i loved this movie and its better then almost all of the movies that are out right now those crapy movies like the grudgewhich i think is one of the dumbest movies out there and dead silence crap like that but this movie is disturbing almost the entire time and is great to see with friends and such at night
Jun 10 2008,negative,dumbest moive ever  alongside honey i
Jun 10 2008,positive,preety good with the realistic factor but cloverfield was still 1o times better
Jun 10 2008,positive,i like this movie why because its different still i cant believe there were actually some idiots out there that thought the video was real then they were blown away when they saw the cast on leno a week after the release the camerawork definitely gets a little dizzy but altogether this scared the hell out of me when i was 14
Jun 9 2008,positive,very good  very stressfull and mysterious 
Jun 9 2008,positive,ok so i havent seen this since it first came out damn almost ten years but i remember being very engaged and i know i loved the ending things are always scarier when you cant see them
Jun 9 2008,positive,fuck all you haters this movie was the shit fake or not
Jun 9 2008,negative,if you like watching a movie thats filmed with a jumpy camera and that will bore the bejesus out of you this ones for you whomever dubbed this as the scariest movie since the exoricist was probably high
Jun 9 2008,positive,well done but the gimmick that sold it aged the moment it was found out
Jun 9 2008,positive,i just saw this film for the first time i avoided it because of all the hype it got at the time i generally try to do that with films just so i dont let other peoples impressions effect my judgement i have to say that i rather enjoyed blair witch project the handheld shots were nicely done and the fact that i never see what is happening to these three is great if it had it wouldve been a totally different film more of a generic horror that the market is over saturated with good film to watch late at night during a thunder storm alone in the dark
Jun 8 2008,neutral,psychological thrillers dont usually scare me and i could not understand why all my friends were displaying suicidal tendencies spinetingling at times with creative and unique cinematography
Jun 8 2008,negative,the most overrated horror film ever as boring as watching paint dry great marketing doesnt make a good film
Jun 8 2008,positive,oh my god i am now scared to go camping and do pretty much anything else
Jun 8 2008,positive,this is a very well acted film and also very innovative however personally i wasnt very scared or thrilled by this movie it just wasnt really convincing to me i also felt that the movie started really slowly
Jun 8 2008,negative,umthat is all i have to say
Jun 8 2008,positive,the film works because its simple and it knows what makes people afraid  because of the low budget the directorsactors had to use their creativity in order to create organic scares and they do so wonderfully  the improvised dialogue gives this so much reality that its creepy at times  due to the low budget you need to use creepy far off noises you need to have something simple like the shaking of a tent and them running out while dragging the camera with them winging it from side to side  but its this back to the basics approach to this scary movie that is so refreshing  the ending of the film is an absolute demon in how it builds and builds and builds and finally reaches a scary as hell ending  great film
Jun 8 2008,positive,scarey ill never quite think of being out in the woods the same again
Jun 8 2008,negative,stupidstill cant believe i watched it
Jun 8 2008,positive,pretty scary i couldnt sleep for quite a while lol in order to understand the ending you need to watch the whole movie seriously
Jun 8 2008,negative,these guys basically tricked everyone into seeing this it wasnt that scary or interesting
Jun 8 2008,positive,original different dont watch it twice
Jun 7 2008,positive,scary movieif you hunt or camp you may never view sleeping in the woods quite the same
Jun 7 2008,positive,this movie is creepy but when you know its not real its not that bad
Jun 7 2008,positive,i have watched horror movie after horror movie and none of them have even sent a chill down my spine then i came across the blair witch project in a 99 cent bargain bin at a local video store i had heard a lot about it and that it was very scary so i picked it up as soon as i placed that tape into my vcr my streak of not getting scared was gone this is the scariest movie i have ever seen and if you dont think so you either werent paying attention or you are just too embarressed to admit that you were scared all i have left to say is good job blair witch on being the first movie to ever scare me
Jun 7 2008,positive,such a good movie but my boyfriends afraid of it
Jun 7 2008,positive,scared the shit out of me and maranda
Jun 7 2008,negative,vomit  serious motion sickness for me
Jun 7 2008,positive,omfg majorly creepy and so realistic
Jun 6 2008,positive,centerimg  biucolorblack9010coloruibcenter  center center  leftcolorwhitei never did get to see the blair witch project when it was originally released pity becuase it would have scared the living shit out of me as a kid blair witch proves that suggestion will always always be scarier then whatever scary thing someone decides to put on screen the film leaves you in the dark about everything and as such you know no more of the characters situation then them themselves sure the people act stupidly at times but thats another aspect that makes the events seen so much more real people will act recklessly when all hell is breaking loose around them ominous wooden figures popping up everywhere children laughing outside the tent the fact that no matter what way they go they cant seem to leave the forest its fuckin creepy blair witch is one of those few horror movies that make the dark seem a little bit deeper and menecing even after its endedcolorleft
Jun 6 2008,positive,was pretty cool at the time
Jun 6 2008,positive,for once i actually was creeped out when i watched this movie it reminded me of my backyard if anything  people dont realize a good movie when they watch one anymore there has to be excessive gore brutalism and fucked up looking creatures eating peoples heads this movie abandoned all of that and let the audience use their imaginations about who the villiam was was it an actual witch or hillbillies running around in the woods killing off out of towners you have to decide and thats what i love about this movie
Jun 6 2008,neutral,one of the first films to use the internet to break in really creepy in some spots
Jun 6 2008,negative,no coment you may like it or hate it i just dint see a point to the whole movie
Jun 6 2008,negative,horrible hilarious
Jun 6 2008,positive,it was original and the hype around it was priceless people thought it was a true story real footage and such i liked it in 99 and i likes it now great ending     never bothered with the sequal
Jun 6 2008,positive,way great film and concept
Jun 5 2008,positive,still the most frightening movie i have ever seen
Jun 5 2008,positive,only worth seeing once
Jun 5 2008,negative,quite possibly the stupidest horror movie ive ever seen
Jun 5 2008,negative,you shouldnt get motion sickness watching a movie in your house
Jun 5 2008,positive,it was good when it first came out
Jun 5 2008,neutral,its kind of like having sex with helen hunt  i mean its fun but like whats the point
Jun 5 2008,positive,this is better than what most people gave it credit for  even thoigh fake it had many people going even though they would never admit it
Jun 5 2008,negative,blah blah blah realism this movie was stupid i waited all movie for the exciting part and it almostish came at the end
Jun 5 2008,positive,its okay  but i recommend the  sequel is way better
Jun 4 2008,negative,one of the dumbest movies ever created
Jun 4 2008,negative,crap absolute crap i dont understand what was so scary about this movie i would have fallen asleep if it werent for my friends and i making fun of the characters as they stupidly died off
Jun 4 2008,positive,scared me granted i was like 10
Jun 3 2008,negative,this movie blowsi can crap out a better movie than this a moviehacant believe i paid money to see this dung in the theater
Jun 3 2008,positive,people either love or hate this movie i can see why from both perspectives but this is still one of the few movies that ive seen that can really play with the viewers imagination effectively very original and creative
Jun 3 2008,positive,daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez turned the horror genre on its ear with their 1999 release of the blair witch project by creating a whole new subgenre the found footage genre love it or hate it it sure makes for some interesting films and no one can contend with the fact that the blair witch project is a true original its a film that plays totally with the psychology of the viewer and uses very simple objects and settings to scare you its all quite simple and brilliant if you ask me the blair witch project is also a classic for being the first of the late 90s films to really tap into the new media emerging at the time churning the hype machine this new thing called the internet like no other the blair witch project will always remain a game changer no matter how you feel about the final product personally i love this camp fire story come to life and embrace it in all its freedom and creativity
Jun 3 2008,positive,scary and lots of bad words but a first of the kind and incrediblely good scary movie that never shows the the blair witch even though you swear you saw it running around
Jun 3 2008,negative,when i first saw this film i was like dang this film is creepy but then i watched it again recently and i was laughing which is messed up because a horror film is not a comedy right they are dumb for even checking out the forest when they know that i psycho had or could be there secondly they had warnings and they didnt consider hmmm we should leave and park near where we camped leave a trail behind them oh yeah and not throw the map away hmmm stupid  lol
Jun 3 2008,positive,filmed for less than 25 000 and marketed with a stroke of genius on the fact that this film contained real footage the blair witch project became a phenomenon deservedly so too for it is one of the most eerie and unsettling films you are ever likely to see it may not be scarey at the time of watching but after youve watched it walk through the woods on your own in the dark and think about it and you will shit yourself enough said
Jun 3 2008,negative,trash i wish i could give it a negative rating
Jun 2 2008,negative,was good til it was confirmed that it was totally a hoaxthe sequel was the shit though
Jun 2 2008,negative,best part was when it was over
Jun 2 2008,positive,i peed my pants literally peed my pants
Jun 2 2008,positive,not bad gives u bit of headache
Jun 2 2008,negative,effing dreadful cant put into words how bad this
Jun 2 2008,negative,i dont know what all the hype was about
Jun 1 2008,positive,one of the most thoughtprovoking horror movies ive seen in a very long time im still trying to figure out how it all happened chilling in that nearly everything is left to the imagination wonderful acting especially for heather she was fantastic but all three actors were good  showing the gradual progression of insanity is not easy and they pulled it off brilliantly overall and very well put together film both creepy and thoughtprovoking
Jun 1 2008,positive,this was one of the only horror flicks that actually scared me this is definatly worth a rent
Jun 1 2008,positive,such a great psychological thriller that is unappreciated by most people who cant get past the idea of that there arent any monsters or psychopaths running around with chainsaws this movie is executed masterfully and creates a very suspenseful and overall creepy feel that is present through the whole film
Jun 1 2008,positive,an intelligent horror movie for the inner scare in all of us
Jun 1 2008,neutral,more interesting for the methodology by which it was created than for the movie itself
Jun 1 2008,positive,this movie had so much hype back when it came out but i never saw it gotta change that
Jun 1 2008,positive,very awesome movie the best horror film ever
May 31 2008,positive,extremely scary the first time you see it
May 31 2008,neutral,it was scary when i was 5 years old
May 31 2008,positive,they were good at making a movie with a budget under 100000 bucks but if the movie had a bigger budget like on the second it would have turned out just as bad i did not like how they waited till the last 20 minutes to show what happened i was personnely not scared until they got to the part with the stick figures and the rocks by the tent overall pretty good i just wish we got a glimpse of the witch when they dropped the camera
May 31 2008,negative,what a bull crap movie
May 31 2008,positive,i watched this movie for the first time a long time after the hype and loved it  its a very simple and effective film that builds and builds until the final scene where i felt i was actually there something i have never felt from a movie before    for me it worked  as for the sequel     poo can i say that oh i just did
May 31 2008,positive,still wouldnt watch this one alone
May 31 2008,positive,original and scary ideal for a halloween night
May 31 2008,positive,one of the truly scariest films ive ever seen a unique experience that burns long in the memory
May 30 2008,negative,i wont blame it since its like one of the earliest filmedwithcamcorder movies or is it the first
May 30 2008,positive,sweet gem of a horror film that was different and paid the price it was a popular fad and made allot of money and then outcasted for its lack of bangbang or witchmonster money shots it is a classic regardless of people opinions on the way it was filmed
May 30 2008,positive,one of the creepiest movies ever those who hate it just dont understand it
May 30 2008,positive,i didnt really like the movie but for some reason it creeps me out i think because they never actually show the witch my visualation of her scared me more than the movie does
May 30 2008,neutral,it was good the first time but lost its thrill after
May 30 2008,neutral,good new view of how to make a horror movie and only with 12 bucks in your pockets
May 30 2008,positive,this is such a creepy movie
May 30 2008,positive,it was a nice change of pace from the other crappy horror movies out at the time
May 29 2008,neutral,scared the crap out of me but wasnt worth the shaking
May 29 2008,negative,so when i went and saw this at the movies i had to take a pee break big mistake it gave me a moment to think about the film and it dawned on me that there was going to be some lame nonending i hate nonendings
May 29 2008,negative,what a crock of shit
May 29 2008,negative,a serious waste of time i could have made a scarier movie in my back yard
May 29 2008,positive,i remember seeing this in the theatre and even with all the hype it was still an absolutely fantastic theatre experience  i still watch it whenever its on
May 29 2008,positive,this was one of those great horror movies that didnt need gore and special effects to scare the shit out of you the ending was classic
May 28 2008,positive,i dont care what bad feedback this film receives from the general public because i really enjoyed this film the first time i saw this i was scared as hell the concept of being lost in a supposedly haunted forestwoods is terrifying this film focus on the things you dont see in order to get its scare out of the audience and it works
May 28 2008,negative,incredibly stupid i watched this when i was 10 and i have to say it totally freaked me out n i thought it was real lol it didnt help that i lived near a secluded foresty area around the time also actors     a twig im scared audience get me some dramamine actors thump
May 28 2008,positive,the most terrifying and brilliant horror movie in the history of cinema

May 27 2008,negative,i expected to be scared  total letdown
May 27 2008,positive,this shit was hella scary the damn tent was shankin and then heather finds a damn cloth with joshs body parts in a cloth of his and the mike gets in da corner and just stands there and has heather killed by the damn witch
May 27 2008,neutral,boring but concept was admirable
May 27 2008,negative,im going to go there and say that this was a bit boring even when i originally saw it  the whole concept of found footage was unheard of when it came out and i remember that people were fainting in the theatres and panicking blah blah blah and i didnt quite understand it then    i watched it again recently and still wasnt afraid or even intrigued just tired  tired and hungry
May 27 2008,positive,a movie you should only watch twice i thought it was an awesome movie just dont over watch it
May 27 2008,neutral,great until you find out its fake
May 27 2008,positive,one of the single most horrifying movies i have ever seen i saw it when it first arrived at the theatre  before the hype and ending was spoiled  and ill never watch it again perhaps not wellwritten it is well thought out and hones in on the most unsettling aspects of being alone in the woods  using the fact that perhaps youre not really alone after all i believe this movie is as good as your imagination makes it
May 27 2008,positive,this was one of the best movies i saw in film studies
May 27 2008,positive,gawd where wud the world be without this one huh
May 27 2008,negative,the film that began the whole handheld style lots of hype but in the end it is very disapointing and not at all scary as advertised
May 26 2008,negative,12 saw it didnt like it  would never see again  1would see it again  3liked  4loved  45loved and then some
May 26 2008,positive,just to piss someone off
May 26 2008,positive,i cant believe i watched both blair witch at the cinemas it wasnt that good
May 26 2008,positive,my favorite movie i love it the fact that you never see the witchsorry if u didnt see it just makes it scarier
May 26 2008,negative,totally weak try watching 1998s the last broadcast for some real terror
May 26 2008,positive,chilled me to the core ticked every box of what scares me
May 26 2008,positive,a truly great chilling film  that will mess with your head
May 25 2008,positive,kind of a joke now but scared the shit out me in its day
May 25 2008,positive,the single scariest film i have ever seen even after multiple viewings i am still horrified to the core
May 25 2008,negative,it sucked too fake
May 25 2008,positive,i like the suspense and everything but the camera just annoyed me i know why its like that but it still is hard to watch freak scary but after a while it just gets too depressing you know their gonna die and so near the end when stuff starts happening you just dont really care
May 25 2008,positive,was good scared the crap out me lol
May 25 2008,positive,a completely original and outstanding piece of filmmaking it has an authentic feel that makes it so much scarier yeah the shaky camera gets annoying but if they had shot this film as a standard hollywood picture it would not have worked you feel you are right with these characters feeling what they feel the ending is brilliant this should be considered among the great horror films of all time with the likes of the exorcist jaws rosemarys baby halloween the omen ect
May 25 2008,positive,i recall not really enjoying this the 1st time i saw it but when with friends a 2nd time and really enjoyed it still  they should left it at this one thou
May 25 2008,positive,very unique for its time  easily one of the best horror movies of the 90s
May 25 2008,positive,one of the greatest independent films of all time very creative and inventive creates an eerie mood which rivals the greatest horror films
May 25 2008,positive,actually pretty good lots of people think its stupid but i think its good for the money they had to spend dont watch it if you get motion sickness
May 25 2008,positive,even though its not real the way the movie was shot it made it seem real and watching the characters go crazy and freak on each other shows how frigented and intense it is
May 24 2008,positive,your imagination does all the scary stuff  very disturbing
May 24 2008,positive,a delicately created masterpiece and yet to be redone original creator of true fear the blair witch project is an excellent scary movie the r rating comes from the very real language of such situation without it there is no violence sexuality or any suggestive or graphic nature of the film deeming something more than a pg13 the actors are totally unknown to the celebrity world and immense themselves in the storyline its extremly hard to tell that this wasnt the real deal some of the best acting i have ever seen at times the screen will risk going completely black with only audio for our gathering intelligence even for minutes on end a lot of the scenes are shot at night with an amateur camera so you can barely make out the trees themselves but even then you are at your most peaked of fears the scary essence in this film is not that some crazed murderer is out to murder an innocent girl going through her naive teenage friends one my one but rather true and frightening concepts that would drive any normal person to insanity if youre looking for action and a chase between a godlike antagonist and an immense amount of soontobedead cops then go elsewhere but if youre ready for some true scares and have invited all the right people that wont spoil this gem prepare for a hard nights sleep
May 24 2008,positive,so scary and freaking awesome
May 24 2008,positive,freaking awesome i made one of the symbols for halloween and it hangs over my bed on the wall when its not that time of the year

May 24 2008,positive,its a good movie very scary ending its actually believeable especially at the end  just so people know theyre alive its fake and stuffx
May 24 2008,positive,a landmark achievement that changed the face of cinema although it follows its own found footage premise to a fault its a triumph of low budget cinema and is truly scary
May 24 2008,positive,its really good i just hate how they try to pass it off as real when its not
May 23 2008,negative,i probably should have listened to the rumours this movie was lllame
May 23 2008,negative,i desperately wanted the witches to kill those annoying kids much quicker than they did
May 23 2008,positive,the blair witch project is a suspenseful and terrifying film that relies on the hitchcock scare method of showing little gore people who dont like this movie just cant appreciate a modern day horror film with little blood
May 23 2008,positive,omg this movie is so cool i was buggin at the end of it you need to watch this
May 23 2008,negative,boring and slow and who would have guessed they all die out there in the woods any with half a brain

May 18 2008,positive,well i have not seen it for a long time but i remember that i liked it very much when i saw it for the first time
May 18 2008,neutral,i watched this the first time when i was house sitting it was a huge old house and it was storming did i mention i was all alone  it was scary the first time but now its kinda stupid

May 17 2008,positive,didnt really live up to the hype for me but it did have a bit of creepiness in the theatre
May 17 2008,positive,at first the home video look of the blair witch project may seem unsettling but as you become intrigued by the mythology of the blair witch and become familiar with the trio of characters it becomes very easy to be caught up in the everescalating tension of the story unreal or not the blair witch project is an experience not to be missed
May 17 2008,negative,annoying i dont understand how people were freaked out by this
May 17 2008,negative,all i can say is that a blue raspberry icee strawberry pull and peel twizzler and this movie is not a good combination

May 16 2008,negative,not nearly as scary as youd think and the camera work will make you sick
May 16 2008,positive,original it sucks you in
May 16 2008,neutral,changed the genre and led to the creation of cloverfield but still not worth my time
May 16 2008,positive,a large majority seems eager to slag this film off but why there isnt an excess of gore sex or profanities its not unpc in fact it was breaking new ground  now the documentary style film is starting to become popular but back in 99 it was unheard of the marketing for this was very cleverly done and so is the film  the ending still chills me  your imagination is far worse than anything you could ever see
May 16 2008,positive,love the end  no explanation nothing thats how a movie should be
May 15 2008,positive,one of the scariest movies for me its really a fucked up situation to get into
May 15 2008,negative,i could never stay awake to watch it all the way through
May 15 2008,positive,deserves more credit than it got just for pulling the wool over so many eyes
May 15 2008,positive,a truly unique way to make a movie  i am a horror movie nutand this is by far the scariest movie ive seen in my life thus far  it may not be that for othersbut for me im very intrigued by the reality of the supernatural so for this movie to seem so real in the homemovie aspect really helped with the scareeffect on me  truly a movie worth seeingjust keep your mind open
May 15 2008,positive,just watched this for the first time in 78 years no budget no alist actors no fx just a capable cast and innovative directingimprov disoriented panic horror coupled with fear of the unknown brilliant for what it is
May 14 2008,positive,scared the 16yearold shit out of me
May 14 2008,neutral,sad people in the woods
May 14 2008,positive,this was a pretty good one i like the documentary approach it used made it seem very realistic
May 14 2008,negative,terrible movie and not because of the camera movement it just plain sucked
May 14 2008,negative,overrated the story didnt have any direction and the ending totally blows given the hype i was so disappointed
May 14 2008,negative,an excellent example of hype a poor example of a movie
May 14 2008,negative,lame lame lame  an indie film does not a good film make  i got seasick watching this
May 14 2008,positive,oh this movie was epic when it came out

May 14 2008,negative,the only movie where i have fallen asleep in the theater
May 13 2008,positive,very innovative horror filmthe shaky camera got to be a bit much though
May 13 2008,neutral,much better the second time around
May 13 2008,negative,please use a camera operrator i am sick
May 13 2008,negative,a for originality f for execution  someone should tell the actors that constantly using the word fuck doesnt not equal good improvised dialogue
May 13 2008,negative,i suffered serious motion sickness from this movie the plot was too slow for the film had it been a good movie id gladly suffer to watch it
May 13 2008,positive,i love this film despite teh critics
May 13 2008,negative,a huge fraud please watch rec youll see the difference 
May 13 2008,positive,kinda weird and slow but the payoff at the end was fun
May 13 2008,neutral,scared the crap out of mebut why
May 13 2008,positive,even if you know its fake this movie is scary the first of its kind the first person documentarystyle horror is a daring step in filmmaking and the creators executed it well  the actors who are not really actors were perfect and the improvisation makes it real
May 12 2008,negative,brutal and overhyped
May 12 2008,positive,low budget improved acting never see anything but hear the conversations of people falling apart scarry enough
May 12 2008,positive,i think the annoying amount of parrodies has given this a bad rep i just watched it again for the first time in many years and think it is a remarkable small scale independent film i challenge anyone who doubts me to take two cameras and three actors into the woods and come out massive hit movie
May 12 2008,positive,one of the most intelligent horror films to date  not simply through the handicam experience but the devotion to detail and fabrication of legend incidents and of course the mind blowing plot  it cleverly manipulates the viewer and strives to suspend disbelief and does to the most frightening levels  for those too stunade enough to denounce the film then evidently they lack film knowledge and cant appreciate a variety of films    i am aghast at how real the characterisation was and the blend of filmic techniques which use amateurish and gauche film methods to generate a horrifying viewing experience  the reality is startling and the invisible evil is even more so
May 12 2008,negative,the only thing that has ever given me motion sickness even several gs dont do that to me
May 12 2008,negative,blair witch project was brilliant in so many ways it was well thought out a great idea well marketed and groundbreaking that being said i hated it i dont know if i would have liked it more had i seen it not knowing it was fake i sat there watching waiting hoping it would get better and when it ended with never having done anything i threw my remaining popcorn at the tv ive seen a a lot of horror films in my day like a lot and not many of them bored me quite as much as blair witch did
May 12 2008,positive,great scary movie love the idea things unseen are scarier than anything else
May 12 2008,neutral,i didnt get why this movie was so scaryi thought it was kind of lame for a horror movie
May 12 2008,negative,stupid boring and then more stupid
May 11 2008,positive,wow  worth all d hypemani watched dis movie yrs after all d hype n hoopla tat surrounded it s release but it still wz pretty scaryd documentary angle was fantastictotaly lovd itd characters were played expertly b d 3 ppln then there wz d beastd cameravry good moviekeeps u on d edge of the seatwith its suspense n horror a very novel n interesting attempt
May 11 2008,positive,this is what cloverfield should have been  one of the greatest endings in film history  totally freaked me out
May 11 2008,negative,crap i thought this would be ok what a pos
May 11 2008,positive,not bad for a lowbudget 22k film was expecting a more elaborate ending but it does keep the audience wondering annoying at times but a good piece of history my question how did they keep shooting on 16
May 11 2008,negative,this shit was corny as hell
May 11 2008,positive,inovative and unique not to be missed
May 11 2008,positive,took me 10 years to see it  i think i would have felt ripped off it id gone to the theatre still it was kind of eerie and pretty well done   i can see what all the hype was about
May 11 2008,negative,warning  spoilers  this had the potential to be a great movie if the characters didnt make me root for their deaths  how annoying and stupid can 3 people be  map is annoying you  throw it in the river  better yet cross the river 5 or 6 times when you come to it instead of following it like any intelligent person knows to do  i could have watched the last 10 minutes of the movie and gotten that same level of entertainment out of it  without losing 90 minutes of my life  sucko
May 11 2008,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and gladly watch it again although i think im alone in that manner the sequal should have been made in the same way but sadly was ruined
May 11 2008,negative,they gave  us puke bags in line at the theatre that was ridiculous
May 11 2008,positive,i watched this in the dark from start to finish and the last 5 seconds of the movie scared the shi out of me and freaked me out everytime i thought about it and what it ment for about 2 months
May 10 2008,positive,alright it was cool that it was the first of its kinda and kept my attention but it got old pretty quick
May 10 2008,negative,not blair witch fan
May 10 2008,negative,sucked a major amount of ass nothing that scared menothing that interested menothing happened

May 10 2008,positive,this is the best movie ever
May 10 2008,positive,omg it was so freaky even if it wasnt very long
May 9 2008,neutral,scared the crap out of meuntil the ending
May 9 2008,negative,so overated there are some good sequences but on the whole this film is just poor and relies totally on its hand held camera gimmick the film is one big anticlimax and the ending is absolute shit will not scare you one bit the only thing that gives any credibility are the actors who do a very good job of sustaining the concept
May 9 2008,negative,im one of the people for whom this movie just did not work stupid people making bad choices is a staple of cheesy horror movies  but a film that wants me to believe its a documentary had better ground itself in reality more firmly than in cheesy horror tropes
May 9 2008,positive,truly the most scarysuspenseful movie ever made
May 9 2008,neutral,i was either yawning the whole time or getting sick to my stomach either way that isnt a good review for any filmthen when the credits started rolling all i could do is laugh comical
May 9 2008,negative,i cant believe how crap this movie is
May 9 2008,positive,it blows my mind that so many people dislike this movie i guess today you need blood and guts for a horror movie to be good incredibly original for its time and scary as hell to boot if only american movies were made this scary anymore
May 8 2008,positive,a great low budget horror film the ending really creeped me out
May 8 2008,negative,where is the action please
May 8 2008,negative,nothing more than scary stuff with little to no substance
May 7 2008,negative,boring downright horrible
May 7 2008,positive,yes i know you all got sea sick at this movie but i thought it was freaking genious that was until i went camping the next day
May 7 2008,neutral,not gonna lie i was scared
May 7 2008,positive,scary scary scary  i was scared for a few days after i watched this
May 7 2008,negative,okay so most overhyped movie of the year maybe a little this movie was downright terrible and its the perfect example of why you shouldnt expect to much from a movie when you go to see it this was by far one of the biggest dissapointmaents in movie history as well as one of the biggest flops thank god cloverfield came out and showed that this type of directing can still be goodi cant really rate this one low enough for it to feel like like i got my hour and a half back but a 5 will half to do
May 7 2008,positive,alot better then i remember it being a decade ago simple unpretensious scares and compared to similar documentaries like cloverfield and cannibal holocaust this was really believeable
May 7 2008,negative,it was crazy the first time i watched it and that was it
May 6 2008,negative,it gets points for trying to be creative with the camera work but it still wasnt scary
May 6 2008,positive,some annoying camera work but an original idea that really was scary at times especially the childrens voices at night and that guy standing facing the wall in the basement of that abandoned house
May 6 2008,negative,i was so scared when i saw it as a child man i was stupid
May 6 2008,positive,has its place in cinema history  you cant deny that the first time you see it is amazing and then its never worth watching again
May 6 2008,positive,reeally good film shows that the oldies can still get to you  i enjoyed it a lot and think there should be a sequel
May 6 2008,negative,it had some scary moments that wouldve been more effective had the atmosphere been sustained throughout the film  the three filmmakers are all annoying as hell so there wasnt really much to sympathise with  i think i liked the ideas but not so much the execution
May 6 2008,negative,friggin horrible first dvd that i ever owned and i didnt get past the first 20 minutes because it sucked so bad
May 6 2008,positive,one of the few people who thought this was a brave expedition into alternative film making this film broke ground in hooking audiences before it was released
May 6 2008,positive,i saw this film on opening night at some tiny indie theatre my friends kept tellin me that this was a documentary and not a drama and it scared the living shit outta me    but now that im older and wiser its just a neat film idea
May 6 2008,negative,scary but nothing happens
May 6 2008,positive,scary  loved it
May 5 2008,positive,its a good film to see  it was low budget and made big box office cash even if you dont like it its a piece to study if you want a career in film
May 5 2008,positive,wellwritten and deceptively well shot i liked the fact it didnt reveal everything but i do feel more could have been done at the beginning and a bigger impact made at the end minor quibbles though
May 5 2008,negative,this movie was not scary it was hilarious
May 5 2008,positive,keeps a steady composure the whole way through the build up of the characters throughout the moviewhen they all far apart and crack it really is amazing a great real scary movie
May 4 2008,neutral,stupid but of course i have seen it along with a shit load of other stupid movies
May 4 2008,positive,in ten or fifteen years sit your kids down and make them watch this movie tell them its real it will be the scariest movie they will ever see
May 4 2008,positive,probably the scariest film ever made and it feels so real with the technique they used to make it your imagination is what makes it scary
May 4 2008,positive,interesting original
May 4 2008,positive,scared the fck out of me my husband still reenact the standing in the corner scene to freak each other out loved it but will never watch it again
May 3 2008,negative,clever movie at that time
May 3 2008,positive,really and truly scary  i was skeptical but it gave me the awoooo creeps
May 3 2008,positive,i just saw this recently by watching it as serialized bits on youtube after reading the av clubs new cult cannon review of it  i must say that even in the tiny lowres vision of youtube it was still an extremely captivating story and an example of everything that horrorsuspense can be  yes yes the shaky camera i know but that in my opinion is one of the best choices made by the director  i found the acting to be extremely powerful and must agree that this film is 100 deserving of its cult status
May 3 2008,positive,1√¢myrick and sanchez both went to central florida in orlando√¢it was there that the idea for a documentary thriller was conceived by watching √¢in search of√¢ 1976 √¢chariot of gods√¢ 19961997 and legend of boggy creek charles b pierce 1972 the original idea had been a pseudodocumentary filler where the narrator tied all police officers friends and family together  2√¢directors took method approach to acting by filming over 8 straight days 247√¢the actors in the woods were equipped with an old cp16mm and a high 8 video camera bought for 500√¢which was later returned to circuit city on a daily basis directors checked equipment and left a note with assigned duties 20 hrs footage cut to 2 √¢¬Ω hours  3√¢marketing filmmakers then ran a website√¢ creating a stir with the public the film aired at sundance on january 23 1999 they had placed leaflets and small posters of 3 √¢missing√¢ film students all over the utah city artisan entertainment was laughed at for picking the film up  4√¢what is american independent cinema microbudget movie grosses 145 million   microbudget  35000√¢mostly to editing
May 3 2008,positive,supremely chilling excellently paced and shot in an innovative style  whats there not to love
May 3 2008,negative,so not worth the hype
May 3 2008,negative,a lot of hype for a lot of nothing

May 3 2008,positive,best horror i have seen its so real like a documentary
May 2 2008,negative,this is definately in that top ten list of some of the worst movies ever made
May 2 2008,positive,right up there with the exorcist and the descent as my favorite horror movies
May 2 2008,positive,i really want to laugh every time i see this movie now
May 2 2008,positive,so unlike cloverfield these people have a reason to still be filming things the hope of still getting out alive and with the project they went to film in the can youre filming about the witch    the witch shows up you dont stop filming do you cloverfield im filming a party    thousands of people are at risk well better keep filming rubbish    aside from that rant even the hype machine couldnt dull the impact this film had on me even watching it now for the umpteenth time it is still brilliant and has a final 10 minutes that rival any other horror film i have ever seen which pays off the build up perfectly
May 2 2008,positive,you either love it or hate it i am one person that loved it
May 2 2008,negative,silliness again a film highlights the supreme gullibility of human beings not remotely scary drear
May 2 2008,negative,i want my money back still
May 2 2008,positive,the moving camera gave me motion sickness
May 2 2008,negative,i want the 2 hours of my life back please
May 1 2008,positive,going along with the hype about this movie made this film more enjoyable the movie in itself is one those that are actually so crappy that they turn out to be entertaining the legend of the blair witch remains intriguing
May 1 2008,negative,complet waste of my time
May 1 2008,positive,overhyped but for those of us who saw it before it was spoofed a million times this is a really unique and influential film and fing scary
May 1 2008,negative,just skip to the last 15 minutesthe rest is crap
May 1 2008,positive,a lot of people knock this film for not being scary but its supposed to be down to you to interpret it i loved and still do love this movie
May 1 2008,negative,creeped me out till i found out it was staged
Apr 30 2008,negative,nothing needs to be said about how crappy this movie is its common knowledge
Apr 30 2008,positive,was great when i though it really happened
Apr 30 2008,positive,this one had me literally shaking my popcorn all over the place  of course i saw it in the theaters and thought it was real  impossible to recreate the experience but it will stay with me forever  yikes
Apr 30 2008,negative,i fell asleep during the movie
Apr 30 2008,positive,great film great concept not the original but very well done
Apr 29 2008,positive,i can see how this is comparable to paranormal activity it wasnt scary but it was a great emotional roller coaster i think its a classic and it deserves that
Apr 29 2008,positive,best horror of the 90s
Apr 29 2008,neutral,man dat was a scary movie especially wen ur watchin it by urself at night eeep
Apr 29 2008,negative,most retarded movie ever documentary yeah right hahahaha  i actually laughed most of the movie
Apr 28 2008,positive,got a headache from the damn cam jittersand it never scared me at all i was rooting for the witch to kill the ignorant bastards by the end
Apr 28 2008,negative,went to see it to be culturally relevant it was an interesting experiment but i dont recommend it
Apr 28 2008,negative,i get motion sickness enough said
Apr 28 2008,positive,people fail to notice that this film wasnt meant to contain a lot of run of the mill horror its a psychological horror movie the point is to show little horror and let your mind do the rest
Apr 28 2008,positive,say what you willthe concept and execution were genius and i got to see this in a small house in the woods at night sent to us by a friend on a black videocassette with no idea what we were in for
Apr 28 2008,positive,the best horror movie ever made in my opinion which is law
Apr 28 2008,positive,forget the backlash nearly a decade after its release bwp is still scary because of its suggestive nature and guerrillastyle filmmaking that coaxes honest and terrifying reactions from the cast
Apr 27 2008,positive,shocking confession time okay well more like stupid heather time  i sometimes live under a rock and dont know very much about things  my friend suggested we go see this film and told me it was a true story and i believed them  on that note i was freaked out by the movie and seriously intrigued by it  the amateurish nature does make it feel like this group of kids are actually lost in the woods spare me continuity error buffs and that there is something evil going on         it seems silly to explain the story considering that everyone knows it by now but here i go  four friends are doing a documentary on the blair witch so they go into the woods with a video camera and something keeps making them disappear  i truly did like it and was spooked until of course i looked it up on the internet and realized id been had like a sucker         the worst part of this film is that it has basically no replay value but if you havent seen it and you havent read this review spoiling it id suggest you try  they really were clever with the way they shot this considering they had no budget and made millionshow many horror films can say that
Apr 27 2008,positive,saw it after almost 10 years of anticipation was pretty worried it wouldnt live up to the hype but i definitely think it did
Apr 27 2008,negative,this movie deserves credit only for its filming techniques and if i remember correctly clever marketing associated with this filming technique other than that i fell asleep due to dizziness caused by watching the jarring camera motions
Apr 27 2008,negative,this movie didnt do the project justice  what they were trying to accomplish just couldnt be done within the two hours they have not to mention im sure they could have added some things to make it more creepy  a good idea wasted  disappointing
Apr 27 2008,positive,if you are looking for the scare of your life look elsewhere  but if you are searching for one profound and twisted moment you will find it in this film  an intelligently crafted film
Apr 27 2008,negative,hot press asked the public for top 100 worst films ever made guess who appeared in the top 10  
Apr 27 2008,negative,a perfect example of how to pretend of something that it isnt a touch of excellent marketing promoting bullshitting and neuro linguistic programming and millions bought it a clever salesman in the shape of a classic film reaping the dollars after
Apr 27 2008,negative,the ones who actually found this scary dont ask me how are those who rate it highly covering their eyes at the moments of suspense the slightly vastly  more mature viewers see all of the film and all of its flaws credit to the makers for making a fortune out of others ignorance
Apr 27 2008,positive,love it or hate it there is no real middle ground  either you can get into this movie or you wont  you really have to immerse yourself in this movie to love it  its original and well written  i got into it and enjoyed it thoroughly
Apr 27 2008,positive,scared the hell out of me back then
Apr 27 2008,positive,the hype was crazy for this movie can i just rate the hype alone
Apr 27 2008,positive,the end was not veryy good and it would of been betterr if we saw sumthing like a witchh
Apr 27 2008,positive,well it scared me but i did watch it in the middle of the night ina dark room
Apr 26 2008,negative,not scary at all not even pulse raising
Apr 26 2008,positive,only ever watched it on a standard tv nevr in cinema and am familiar with manya home video think these elemens are what made this one of the scariest films ive seen
Apr 26 2008,negative,this movie is extreamly overated
Apr 26 2008,positive,flipping creepy the bad language was excessive and unnecessary though but it paved the way for that talking with your face right infront of the camera all scared joke lol
Apr 25 2008,positive,massively underrated as a result of being considered overrated a truly exceptional piece of cinema
Apr 25 2008,positive,before the hype was an art house film but there is much controversy now on whether or not its scary people wither love it or hate it with this one
Apr 25 2008,positive,nauseatingly wonderful think ill take some dramamine then rent this and cloverfield for a night of barfutainment
Apr 25 2008,negative,ha ha ha who said this was scary
Apr 24 2008,neutral,once the gimmick wears off all youre left with is alot of shaky cam and teens cursing
Apr 24 2008,positive,fantastic movie and still the only horror type film that has left me feeling uneasy after watching needs to be watched alone in the dark though dont watch alone in the dark  shit film for full effect  just goes to show that psychology is a far more powerful tool than all the gore in an fulci film
Apr 24 2008,positive,boring at the begining but it gets really creepy at the end
Apr 23 2008,negative,it was alright until the end
Apr 23 2008,positive,i can think of very few movies thats effectiveness hinges so totally on the enviornment in which it is watched i saw it in the best format i could drum up and it blew my mind i hadnt been so scared by anything in a long time and i havnt since it realy got to me to say the least others find it funny and i can understand this its cheap and if watched with a group it could become very funny watch it the right way and you will see what i saw
Apr 23 2008,negative,thanks for taking my money
Apr 23 2008,positive,i dont watch too many horror movies and this movie is a clear example why
Apr 23 2008,neutral,nothings happening  nothings happening  its over  a lot of people in the audience looked pissed

Apr 23 2008,positive,very creative for its time
Apr 23 2008,positive,scared the shart out of me
Apr 23 2008,positive,not that it was a good movie but it was a mass media giant
Apr 23 2008,positive,the first time i saw this i thought it was somewhat real because i heard very little about it i was scared shitless the second time i watched it i didnt have the same adreniline rush
Apr 22 2008,negative,made us sickliterally
Apr 22 2008,negative,this is with no understatements the worst movie i have ever seen period
Apr 22 2008,positive,i liked it  i offer no apologies for the time its style and its marketing were highly inventive and original which is why theyve been done to death now
Apr 22 2008,positive,love it or hate it but you have to admit it was original
Apr 22 2008,positive,it gets slated a lot but it was different at the time and dont pretend you werent enthralled by the clever marketing
Apr 22 2008,positive,not bad though i love gore psychological horror is much scarier
Apr 22 2008,negative,if i hadnt snuck in to this movie for being too young i would have asked for my money back not even good enough for youtube
Apr 21 2008,positive,pretty good not as scary as i thought  am i  a little freaked cause i was driving up where they were filming this past weekend i must go back up 
Apr 21 2008,positive,after watching this again many years later my opinion of the film has completely changed     full review at some point
Apr 21 2008,positive,i had nightmares for months
Apr 21 2008,negative,i want my money back and my 2hours too
Apr 21 2008,positive,it scared me its shot like a home video when it first came out there were all these rumors it was a true story the creators even started a hoax website if i remember correctly
Apr 21 2008,negative,a waste of time  only reason its known is because of its style that until cloverfield hadnt been fully utilized
Apr 20 2008,neutral,haha  legitimately scared me in the theaters
Apr 20 2008,negative,yuck documentary filming not fun
Apr 20 2008,negative,omg so crap it wasnt funnyi cant believe they actually released this movie

Apr 17 2008,negative,what a damn joke total waste of time
Apr 17 2008,negative,close second to ai for the worst ending ever
Apr 17 2008,positive,the blair witch project is an example of true suspensethe movie was made by a group of ucf film school studentsso im told the campaign for the movie was also a huge dealbecause they advertised it as a true storyyes they do not show the blair witch or anything that desturbes the group of kids in the woods but that should turn you away from this moviebecause that is what build the suspense
Apr 17 2008,positive,ten years on i enjoyed it even more than i did in the cinema a decade ago 5 stars
Apr 17 2008,negative,one of the lowest point in movie history ive nothing against wannabe filmmakers practising their future profession but i certainly dont care to see their efforts this film is about as amateur as it gets the very end made me laugh out loud and that wasnt because of its entertainment factor i guess you have to blindly follow horrormovies to get one i dont so i wish the cast and crew all the worst of luck
Apr 16 2008,positive,psycologically scary
Apr 16 2008,positive,the memmories with this movie make me laugh
Apr 16 2008,positive,it was ok given it took like only 100 bucks to make
Apr 16 2008,positive,it was good but camera movement made me feel ill
Apr 15 2008,positive,proof that an independent film can rock hollywoods head
Apr 15 2008,positive,centerfontarial blacksize4colorredreview requested by foolofatookcolorsizefontcenter  centerimg  center center    leftfontarial blacksize3an inventive and haunting horror film i was stuck imbetween giving ithe blair witch project ia 7 and an 8  but decided to settle with a very high 7 im not giving iblair witch ian 8 because it has very little rewatch value this seems like the type of movie you can only watch once since the originality of its fake documentary style would fade the second time around also iblair witch ibecomes somewhat reptitive near the middle it got a bit old watching these people walk around cuss at each other and get creeped out by random noises in the woods this repetition only plagues iblair witchis middle section though  the first third set up the premise perfectly and the last third picked up intensity and kept me fascinatedsizefontleft  left left    leftfontarial blacksize3those two problems aside ithe blair witch project iis a highly effective unsettling horror film the characters feel very realistic and the acting especially from the main girl was pretty fantastic the terror and frustration they went through seemed completely genuine and while i didnt find ithe blair witch project ito be scary it was definitely haunting and creepy the last 10 minutes were especially unsettling the main girls upclose terrified apology to the camera was an emotionallycharged creepy scene  and the very ending was brilliant at first i didnt understand what happened in the two last minutes but then i rewound it to watch it again and remembered something from earlier in the movie  and then i got real real creeped out i get chills even thinking about itsizefont left
Apr 15 2008,positive,scared the shit outta me
Apr 14 2008,positive,yeah i know its sad but this movie scared the crap out of me
Apr 14 2008,positive,scared me the first time around  amazed me the second at how well a movie could be made with such a small budget and cast  third time around boredom reigned  if you want the full affect watch it alone and in the dark  otherwise you can be easily distracted elsewhere
Apr 14 2008,positive,lol should i give it 5 or 0
Apr 14 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me and my roommates
Apr 14 2008,positive,i thought this was actually really well done and actually can be quite scary
Apr 14 2008,positive,i thought that this was a very smart movie and a complete mind screw most people said they hated it bc of the shaky camera but that is what is so smart and it was the first movie to do sothen everyone else had to try itplus it was one of the first movies to really utilize the internet and everyone thought it was for real bc that is what was stated on the websitepure genius marketing and film making  most people that saw this still cant go campinglol
Apr 13 2008,positive,good for one viewing  if you havent seen the million parodies of it  or dont know anything about it  basically if you didnt see it in the theater before the hype dont worry about seeing it now
Apr 13 2008,positive,this movie gets alot of negative feedback and i have no idea why it was amazing it was creative had an interesting plot amazing setting and film locations a great back story and awesome acting    in my mind this is a perfect horror movie it is so suspenseful and chilling that it makes movies like the exorcist look like alladin the whole handheld camera idea was very effective for this movie it didnt really work out with cloverfield but this movie is on a whole other level i see why movies like rec and cloverfield took the whole idea    the ending was what really got me when one of the characters disappears and they find a piece of cloth with his teeth in it when the characters are walking throuhg the house was pretty intense too i think people found the beginning boring which was really the most important part of the movie     i really wish that there were as creative ideas as this circulating out there you can only watch so many remakes and sequels to saw before you have to find something new and original which is why im going back to modern classics like this    i cant reccommend this movie enough i think those people who didnt like it need to rewatch it and pay attention
Apr 13 2008,positive,allrightwhatcha think cloverfield monster vs blair witch  whos got it  
Apr 13 2008,negative,if this movie had never been made we would be missing out on all the hilarious spoofs thats the only thing i would miss about it
Apr 13 2008,neutral,one of the biggest piece of over rated crap i have seen
Apr 13 2008,positive,splendid excellent concept shockingly good
Apr 12 2008,positive,if you wanna watch this film alone in the dark like i did i reccomend you wear a nappy
Apr 12 2008,positive,i respect its interesting approach to filming a movie like this making it look like student video footage and all but frankly i didnt find it scary at all  the creepiest moment was that flash of the guy standing in the corner at the end  i was honestly siding with the blair witch hoping those annoying kids would just get killed already and go away
Apr 12 2008,positive,a lot of hype that it couldnt live up to
Apr 12 2008,neutral,quick gravol and a barf bag please  good concept but not good for ppl with any sort of balance problems
Apr 12 2008,positive,i loved this movie the feeling of anxiety tension throughout the story is fantastic and all because of the nice camera angles and the good acting and the final third of the movie was really creepy
Apr 12 2008,negative,stupid my friend threw up because of motion sickness
Apr 11 2008,negative,thort it suked and didnt reallly get it
Apr 11 2008,negative,i appreciate the attempts made in trying to be creative but i found this more annoying than creepy classic horror mistake of making me not give a crap about the characters so i couldnt care less for their well being thus taking away some of the creepiness
Apr 11 2008,negative,when i first saw this i thought it was okay but now i have to say that ive changed my mind it was an interesting premise but there are too many obvious holes in the storyline heck they kept coming back to the same brook when they were lost heres a tip follow the brook had the potential to be much more
Apr 11 2008,positive,simple filmmaking but horrifying nonetheless
Apr 11 2008,negative,i honestly thought this was real i know i know
Apr 11 2008,negative,this movie is a little bit uh should i put it stupid dumb effen retarded
Apr 11 2008,positive,certainly different and very stylish its creepy enough to be enjoyable
Apr 10 2008,positive,i was hesitant to review this movie the first time i saw it years ago because so many people seemed to hate it  i saw it again in its entirety on youtube seven 10minute videos and am now convinced it was a landmark in filmmaking  made for 20k with no stars and no special effects it is arguably one of the most effective horror movies ever due to one fact so overlooked in the genre  that scariest place to be is in your own imagination  outstanding acting by ordinary people great editing  it all came together  great job
Apr 10 2008,positive,crazy cinematography  unbelievable acting  almost no visual stimuli all the horror comes from the actors reactions to the situation
Apr 10 2008,positive,scared the crap outta me
Apr 10 2008,positive,good when i was in high school
Apr 10 2008,negative,thatwas the worst way of spending 9 bucks ever
Apr 10 2008,positive,jump factor only exists on first viewing
Apr 10 2008,neutral,watch it just before camping
Apr 10 2008,positive,this was an ok way to pass the time at the time i could remember it was mega hyped and for that reason i stayed away it was passable and id heard and read that the confession would have me in nightmares for days sorry i couldnt really get into it to believe it the ending seemed a little beaten up with the shouting and screaming and frantic camera work
Apr 9 2008,negative,waste of time and money
Apr 9 2008,positive,this movie was great the first time you watched or should i say if you watched it thinking it was a true story
Apr 9 2008,negative,i cant even fucking talk about this half star for destroying my life
Apr 9 2008,positive,a classic horror and its good the first time around but upon a second viewing it didnt impress as much
Apr 9 2008,positive,in my opinion very creepy the way they hyped this movie in the us can be discussed but still this movie is able to scare you up reality lies close all the time and acting is believable if you ask me great film
Apr 9 2008,positive,still scares the crap out of me
Apr 9 2008,negative,the camera movement makes me sick
Apr 9 2008,neutral,pretty scary the first time i saw it and the way it is filmed only adds to the spooky effect it is not a typical horror movie and plays more on the psychological
Apr 9 2008,positive,was scared for days after although i dont know why
Apr 8 2008,negative,too much wood not enough witch
Apr 8 2008,positive,oftmaligned but definitely ahead of its time one of the few major films i can think of besides john waters films that was filmed in maryland only now is  the influence of this movie starting to show though that may not necessarily be a good thing
Apr 8 2008,negative,only gave it a star for the end bit freaks me out just thinkin of it
Apr 8 2008,positive,the jumpy camera makes people sick but the story was very original at the time
Apr 8 2008,positive,the power of suggestion isnt doing much for people these days apparently well i liked it hmph
Apr 8 2008,neutral,it was scarrier when i thought it may be a true story
Apr 7 2008,negative,what the hell was all the hype about
Apr 7 2008,negative,the sci fi channel special was better the best part of the movie was the ending
Apr 7 2008,positive,it started out very slow but i thought it was genuinely creepy as fuck
Apr 6 2008,positive,impressive camera work the young actors werent bad but this film didnt seem to go anywhere an effective horror film but could have been better
Apr 6 2008,positive,im never been scared while watching a movie im immune to horror however this is the first movie where i have been too scared to close my eyes and too scared to open them
Apr 6 2008,positive,the film that truly pushed fauxverite into the mainstream not very original but a great film none the less the ending is spooky as hell
Apr 6 2008,positive,only because i seen it before it was big
Apr 5 2008,negative,the more i watch it the less i like it
Apr 5 2008,positive,one of the scariest and most original horror films i have ever seen made me say i was afraid of the dark again and that i will never go camping i havent been this scared since i was 6 even though the tale is fictional it seems so real the whole movie was done on improvision hunger thirst and sleep deprovation for a horror film it is one of the freakiest and most original ever
Apr 5 2008,positive,despite what many people think  liked this and the concept was different and creative
Apr 4 2008,neutral,this movie made such an impact on filmmaking  it really cant be overstated for 65000 the filmmakers turned in a revolutionary film that found a brand new way of terrifying its audiences realism
Apr 4 2008,negative,it was good when it first came out but got overhyped cant stand it now especially living in maryland there is no blair witch
Apr 3 2008,positive,very origional props for making a horror films without using any special effects wouldnt mind watching it again when the time is right
Apr 3 2008,negative,i want my giggle back

Apr 3 2008,negative,worst movie of all time
Apr 3 2008,positive,im sorry shake the camera
Apr 2 2008,positive,its really well done for what it is even though its an accidental ripoff of cannibal holocaust the acting was kinda corny not to say that it wasnt realistic for moronic film students who wanted to film a documentary about a witch the main reason it works is because of that fear of the unknown but when you dont deliver at all it tends to get annoying
Apr 2 2008,positive,if youve watched this movie once and enjoyed it dont watch it again because its a different experience
Apr 2 2008,negative,overated and not scary at all
Apr 2 2008,positive,shows what the power of the mind can do for a horror film cause really nothing happens the entire time creepy unsettling  down right scary
Apr 2 2008,positive,this movie was fucking scary
Apr 2 2008,neutral,a good idea and filmed with excellent naturalism but it just wasn√¢t scary
Apr 2 2008,positive,i hate scary movies anyway
Apr 2 2008,positive,ive always wanted to work on a film like this
Apr 2 2008,positive,saw it again last night still scares the shit out of me much more effective than cloverfield
Apr 2 2008,positive,i rated it a four because i find it was put together so well in terms of plotting and the acting was delivered it also kept up with its fear of the unknown and messed with our minds while watching it
Apr 2 2008,negative,2 hours of my life that i will never get back it was so bad we couldnt even be bothered to move off the sofa to switch it off
Apr 2 2008,negative,dint scare me at all and i scare easy
Apr 1 2008,negative,horrible and people actually believed this steaming pile of dog feces was a true story
Apr 1 2008,positive,awesome movie one of the best horror movies ive yet to see  gave me chills during those tent scenes while giving laughs during the hysteric scenes when the group was just totally pissed at each other  scene with the branches made into the symbol of the blair witch awesome simply awesome
Apr 1 2008,negative,this thing got lambasted it was an interesting idea but when i watched it i found myself unhappy with how stupid the kids were
Apr 1 2008,positive,best horror film in a long long time scared the living shit out of me and is the only film to ever do that
Apr 1 2008,positive,embarrassingly enough i love this film
Mar 31 2008,positive,its a good effective original though lessthantremendously scary horror   it proves imagination is scarier than nonsensical grudgemonsters crawling down the stairs
Mar 31 2008,positive,shiversman this is scaryman    im just gonna umrun awayfrom my closetsand likesleepwith holy water in it  ahhh
Mar 31 2008,positive,that was fucking great
Mar 31 2008,negative,why was this even made the acting was awful the story was awfulif there even was a story it was 87 minutes ill never get back
Mar 31 2008,negative,one of the worst horror films i have ever seen
Mar 31 2008,positive,i remember when this released i was but 14 years old i didnt see it until 12 years later the initial mystery behind the movie is shattered as everyone knows that duh it isnt real of course as a sensible 14 year old i knew that already though as a sensible 14 year old i also had zero interest in horror to begin with as an increasingly unsensible 26 year old i now love horror and this was a major hole in my viewing pleasure there are things done well in this movie and things done not so well other people have focused heavily on the negative points to quickly recap shakycamkinda obnoxious cam pointed at nothingkinda boring repetitious dialogkinda irksome ok good with that out of the way bwp evokes a great atmosphere not just ooo were in the forest kind of atmosphere but bonafide tension and rising terror as my eyes strained through the handheld video to try and catch a glimpse of the villain that we are at the mercy of whatever direction the camera is pointed in makes it painfully obvious that there is a large section of the surrounding area we cannot see at any moment something could leap out it is really effective and without that feature this wouldnt have been as strong of a movie the cast is solid enough the only person who stands out is heather who is both beautiful and is somehow prettier the more scared her character gets and the leader of the small troupe unfortunately for as great as she is on screen she stays behind the camera most of the time leaving michael and josh as the two people to take up the most screen time even from behind the camera though heather is powerful because our perspective is generally her perspective we gravitate toward her character lastly i love the marketing of this movie being real while it is kind of a lie actually very much so the artistic rationale for doing such a thing is solid it is merely the creators wanting to frame the movie to give viewers a certain experience anyway worth seeing
Mar 30 2008,negative,i saw this in the theater and it made me throw up
Mar 30 2008,negative,haha you suck if this scared you youtube the blair thumb
Mar 30 2008,negative,when i saw this at the theater people booed it at the end i was one of those people
Mar 30 2008,negative,nausea and confusion
Mar 30 2008,positive,it made my fiend puke  i sat there just knowing what those stupid fucks were doing wrongie what they should have brought instead of marshmallows to deal with a powerful vengeful witch  however i have to say this film is obviously going to go down in history although i always thought they got the idea from ripping of cannibal holocaust but in defensei own it ergo i got sucked in  gorewhore out
Mar 30 2008,positive,i saw this movie when it came out about 10 years ago but forgot how good it really is i certainly didnt remember much of it so watching it now was like seeing it for the first time anyway what i enjoy the most about this movie is its originality in this so often sloppy genre the rough firstperson camera work helps bring the viewer into the movie and its interesting that the antagonist is never seen but remains scarier than most
Mar 29 2008,neutral,i didnt have the holy shit was that real experience
Mar 29 2008,negative,im floating im floating insert meaningless expletive here    this is not a movie this is a waste of the actors time for making them sound like complete idiots and then making them pretend to be the lost idiots they were impersonating it was a waste of the audiences time because by classifying something as a movie people were bound to bear witness to this atrocity finally though the studio wasted its measly 500 dollar budget because they decided to make this shit instead of doing something more worth their while like investing it in enron
Mar 29 2008,positive,it was ok i guess the ending was the only really scary part oh and the scene where you can only see heathers eyes is absolutely riveting other than that though theres not a lot unless you count all the fbombs they screamed at each other the idea behind the project is really good and i expected a lot more but the end result is just well blah
Mar 29 2008,negative,you either love it or hate it  i hate it
Mar 29 2008,negative,the only cool thing about this movie is that they managed to make so much money off of it
Mar 28 2008,negative,i got suckered by the hype and am still a little bitter
Mar 28 2008,positive,dont watch this in the dark or by yourself ugh creepy stuff but intriguing

Mar 28 2008,positive,on first viewing i liked it
Mar 28 2008,positive,wtf u never seen see the damn thing
Mar 28 2008,negative,i have no idea why this is so famous
Mar 28 2008,positive,i give it three and a half stars from the perspective of a person that really sat down to watch the movie once all the way through  if youve never seen it watch it  now for those of you whove seen it repeatedly youll of course disagree  im kinda conflicted myself
Mar 28 2008,positive,pretty cool it does have frightening segments
Mar 28 2008,positive,its scary damnit you have to give it a chance
Mar 28 2008,positive,holy shit dont stand in the corner fuck
Mar 28 2008,neutral,it is pretty decent for a viewing or maybe a 2nd a few months later  typical people get a little cooky in the deep woods
Mar 27 2008,negative,a unique experiment with creepy results and much overhype
Mar 27 2008,positive,this movie was amazing so fuck you get over yourself and start loving this groundbreaking scary realistic masterpiece i will never camp in the middle of the woods
Mar 27 2008,negative,never actually saw the whole thing but come onreally
Mar 27 2008,positive,cool ending pretty dam good for such an incredibly low budget

Mar 27 2008,positive,scared the bejaysus outta me
Mar 27 2008,negative,boring boring boring  not even a tiny bit scary wow some kids standing in the corner crap
Mar 26 2008,neutral,lots of the f word  wasnt that scary
Mar 26 2008,positive,alright im giving this movie five stars because everyone else is too darn afraid to admit that this was the first freaky movie their imagination ran wild on  the fact that we never saw the witch made it all the more scarier and everyone ive talked to has said the camera made them sick  what makes me sick is no one being able to admit this was a truly frieken scary and ingenous flick
Mar 26 2008,negative,why would this be made its so bad
Mar 26 2008,positive,scared the beejesus out of me the first time i saw it
Mar 26 2008,negative,not scary at all unless you have a fear of the unknown and a fear of the dark i was more irritated by the bouncing camera than the plot though
Mar 26 2008,positive,fascinating how it was shot
Mar 26 2008,negative,did not live up to the hype
Mar 26 2008,positive,the forest is not a safe place anymore
Mar 25 2008,negative,lame but good in its owen way
Mar 25 2008,neutral,interesting concept but poorly executed  definitely not deserving of a sequal
Mar 25 2008,negative,total garbage  i think the creators must have generated their own hype to up the profits cos i cannot fathom who would have bigged up this utter shitfest  shite story shite start shite middle shite ending shite acting shite trees shite torches shite beanies shite shite shite
Mar 25 2008,positive,lost its spark after i found out it wasnt true but i still couldnt stand in a corner afetr watching it xx
Mar 25 2008,negative,ill never forgive this movie because of the following dialogue which way should we go which one was the bad one the wicked witch of the west or the wicked witch of the east they actually said that i almost punched the television
Mar 25 2008,positive,really good movie pretty freaky but not really
Mar 25 2008,positive,this movie which really scared the crap out of me was very good but was it real or was it a fake movie im not sure
Mar 25 2008,negative,bad awful stupid slow boring not scary lame
Mar 24 2008,positive,a psychological horror classic the blair witch project is a simple yet brutally frightening masterpiece about a group of film student campers who become lost and hunted by an unseen enemy the film revolutionized the horror film in the documentary format and gave way for many to follow including my little eye cloverfield rec and george a romeros diary of the dead its slow building suspense realism and ambiguity make it one of the scariest horror films of the 90s
Mar 24 2008,positive,scared the crap outta me when i had to walk down the driveway by myself after seein it
Mar 24 2008,positive,the only reason my rating is so high is because the idea behind the movie was scarier than the actual film  the standing in the corner thing end of movie assuming they are dead yeah the tricks your own mind can play on you are scarier than those that others play  the best part of this movie is knowing two people with the names mike3 and josh3
Mar 24 2008,negative,i d k about this movie u
Mar 24 2008,negative,i guess i cant really rate thisseeing that my friends and i couldnt get through the whole thingit was just that boring
Mar 24 2008,negative,i thought this movie was dumb  im sure it would have been better is i saw it back when everyone still thought it was real
Mar 24 2008,positive,an ok film took me ages to get used to the filming stlye but i know thats the whole point of the film
Mar 24 2008,negative,i regret the time i spent in the theatre and looking at the online crap too talk about shit
Mar 24 2008,positive,wasnt so terrifyingneed more effects and sound
Mar 24 2008,positive,too many people hate on this movie i think theyre pissed because they got suckered
Mar 23 2008,positive,sitting at home with the lights off on halloween is the only time to watching
Mar 23 2008,negative,i fell asleep in the movie theater im not kidding i was out like a baby seriously if i wanted to see the trees wizzing by me for a couple of hours then i would have just gone out to the country and ran i almost went to the ticket booth and demanded my money back
Mar 23 2008,positive,this freaked me out so much  very good film
Mar 23 2008,neutral,what a horrible let down decent enough lord of the flies movie could have been great but missed
Mar 23 2008,positive,i remember watching this in like gr 6 while home alone in the midst of night it had me a bit scared but overall the movie isnt all that good
Mar 23 2008,neutral,a perfect example of a great concept poorly executed the blair witch project had a revolutionary idea make a documentarystyle horror film it inspired billions of horror films after that and sadly most of them were more effective than the blair witch itself the film starts off promisingly with the film crew making a cheesy documentary then they get to the forest and things get very shakyliterally theres a lot of screaming running around and closeups of snotty noses but very little if no scares it picks up pace towards the end and the house scenes are genuinely creepy but by then its way too late disappointment has already set in entertaining yet fatally flawed
Mar 22 2008,positive,creeped me out but i have to admit i own it and think it was very creative
Mar 22 2008,positive,dont like it now but it scared the hell out of me when i was 12
Mar 22 2008,positive,i dont like to watch scary movies  this one woke me up in the middle of the night seeing someone in the corner of my room  but the real payoff is listening to the directors commentary on the dvdhilarious
Mar 22 2008,positive,brilliant the best bit is the 3mins of darkness where th baby giggles terrifying before going camping
Mar 21 2008,positive,i was so scared pretty realistic only because it was documentary style
Mar 21 2008,negative,so dont get what the hype was about
Mar 21 2008,neutral,s fucking scary documentary 
Mar 21 2008,positive,not the best horror not even that scary but genius in its marketing and concept i love the backstory with this movie check it out and look up rustin parr i hate the shakey cam with this movie and most movies that do shakey cam but this is an important movie too bad the sequels dont even register
Mar 21 2008,negative,i just didnt fall asleep because i wanted to get my moneys worth out of it  paid god knows how much the ticket cost to spend more than half the time watching a blank screenoriginal like hell
Mar 21 2008,positive,it was scary when i was 12 now its just boring
Mar 21 2008,positive,the shaky camera thing was cool i liked it and i will admit was freaked but didnt think it was absolutely terrifying

Mar 21 2008,positive,im so sorry sniff sniff
Mar 21 2008,positive,origional but boring
Mar 20 2008,positive,psychologically terrifying and incredibly atmospheric the uinque handheld feel of this film relentlessly draws the viewer in leading to a climax that is bizarre but definitely frightening the acting feels very natural and the cinematography polishes off this icon of horror filmmaking
Mar 20 2008,positive,dont watch this one alone my friendbuy it
Mar 20 2008,positive,freaky movie loved it
Mar 20 2008,neutral,two words scopolamine patch before you watch this

Mar 18 2008,positive,impressively well done
Mar 18 2008,negative,overrated and boring  not scary at all  great marketing though
Mar 17 2008,negative,not worth the hype but the premise was pretty novel  execution though was pretty bad mostly because of such a loose plot  good ending though

Mar 16 2008,positive,was overhyped but not too bad
Mar 16 2008,positive,the blair witch project is one of the more unique films ive seen recently not only did it provide decent scares like all horror films should but the format that it is presented really stands out not only does it look like real footage but the characters act and seem real this is what makes parts of the film so scary it is not the actual witch that is scary but how reallisticly insane the characters act dont get me wrong though the witch is pretty scary at parts though this only happens at night that is only real problem with this film during the daylight it loses its scary effects overall i enjoyed it very much this movie is not for all tastes though

Mar 15 2008,negative,kinda lame movie i didnt see why people put this on a pedestal and saying it was so good  i work in that area in maryland and its not as remote as this film makes it out to be  they should have probably have used a more remote place like wyoming or montana

Mar 10 2008,negative,was the worst wasnt even scary until the very end way overrated
Mar 10 2008,neutral,i mostly remember an overwhelming sense of disappointment not really suspenseful or scary at all it was essentially all hype
Mar 9 2008,negative,overrated its nothing but a  sometimes excruciatingly  slow simmer until the final scene only then does the freakout turn itself on i can understand its place in pop culture and movie history but such films arent necessarily good this is one mostly it just gave me a terrible headache and made me rather nauseous
Mar 9 2008,positive,it was pretty awesome for its time
Mar 9 2008,positive,the 3 stars is for the end scenewhich is one of the creepiest scenes ive seen in any movie to date

Mar 8 2008,negative,really um riiiight
Mar 8 2008,negative,this was the most hideously overrated waste of videotape ive ever seen  its much more contrived than the formulaic hollywood horror films that blair witch was supposed to unseat

Mar 7 2008,positive,realitymoviecomes full circle
Mar 6 2008,positive,in all its simplicity a very original and effective horror movie certainly not for everybodys taste but a real gem for someone with my weird taste for strange low budget movies
Mar 6 2008,negative,the single most disappointing movie i have ever had the misfortune of having to sit through the halfstar rating is too generous
Mar 6 2008,positive,i thought this a fantastic and very unsettling movie the problem is i saw it in 2008 for the first time ten years after i heard about it and have long since heard everything about it still worth watching in the dark at night i like
Mar 6 2008,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
Mar 6 2008,positive,if you can take a crappy homemade movie and make millions you deserve props

Mar 5 2008,positive,good i thought it was real 2 start with
Mar 5 2008,negative,i watched the movie and later on tried to flush it down the toilet with no success at all when covered in toilet water i tried to set it on fire using gasoline and a litte bit of alcohol no use the movie is still here today its like my own little the ring casette please make it stop so strait to the point it sucked a ton
Mar 5 2008,positive,one of a kind at the time
Mar 5 2008,negative,overhyped and overrated
Mar 4 2008,neutral,kinda scary and you have to give them credit for that unforgiving ending
Mar 4 2008,negative,easily the most overrated horror movie ever the only reason it did so well is because people thought it was real when it first came out  you want a good handicam horror movie check out the spanish film rec
Mar 4 2008,negative,when i first saw the title i was expecting a documentary about claire short  if it had have been it may have been a more interesting movie  three amatuer filmmakers go for a walk in the woods get lost and then shout and swear a lot  thats it  i actually fell asleep in the cinema while i was watching this  mind you the prequel or sequel or whatever it is is even worse
Mar 3 2008,negative,umm miss miss you have boogers coming out your nose

Mar 3 2008,positive,creepy those sounds in the woods were fd up
Mar 3 2008,positive,i know all the criticisms and some of them are warranted there is a lot of nothing happening in the woods but i truly liked it  i found it eerie especially the final act its the kind of film that makes every film like it seem derivative
Mar 3 2008,negative,youve got a cliffhanger wipe it
Mar 3 2008,positive,well after all i knew about the fake story which was made up up front but still it took me years to go into a forest alone again after i watched this movie
Mar 3 2008,negative,too much fuss for no reason
Mar 3 2008,positive,im afraid to close my eyes im afraid to open them    the blair witch project was the first really popular found footage movie of my generation and cloverfield paranormal activity recquarantine and other movies owe a lot of their success to this lowbudget flick if was megapopular though divisive when it was released in 1999 but is it still chilling when watched today for the most part yes     what makes the blair witch project effective is the great way that atmosphere and fear of the unknown are used as well as how well the three actors sell their frustration unease and finally terror as the three amateur filmmakers get more and more lost in the woods their anger and annoyance at one another and their situation does a great job of raising the tension add that to the local legends that they were exposed to before venturing out into the wilderness and the odd disturbing events that start happening each night and youve got a pretty creepy little film    the key to enjoying movies like the blair witch project is how easily you can suspend your sense of disbelief and just go with what youre seeing if the movie can draw you in youll probably have a good time with it i didnt have a hard time putting myself in the shoes of our trio and i know that if i had been in their situation i would have been well and properly freaked out it had been probably five years since i last saw this but it still gave me the creeps and i still love the ending its a fun movie for the right kind of horror fan
Mar 3 2008,negative,the most rubbish film you could see i put this film on to put myself to sleep
Mar 3 2008,negative,the idea was nice real thing filmed by students the problem is it simply not looks like real tape it looks like cheap way to make a horror it is not scary its boring
Mar 2 2008,positive,it was revolutionary for its time
Mar 2 2008,positive,scared the hell outta me
Mar 2 2008,positive,omgggg  so frickennn scaryyyyyyy

Mar 2 2008,negative,build up to this film was worldwide ive been scared more on my toilet
Mar 2 2008,positive,interesting and innovative movie experience in the psychological horror genre mainly due to its cuttingedge internet marketing hype given the initial thrill however the movie frankly becomes dull
Mar 2 2008,neutral,ummm well  ok this is original it was somewhat scary but the the scariest movie of all times  a horror masterpiece well no not really its fun to watch a couple of times thats all about it

Feb 29 2008,neutral,yes this movie scared the pants off me when i was fourteen
Feb 29 2008,positive,i have only watched this movie once well twice but the second time was with commentary say what you will about this movie while now i cant take it seriously but back when it came out it really freaked alot of people out and when i watched it it freaked me out as well
Feb 29 2008,neutral,without the hype its interesting for a prefan made videos era
Feb 29 2008,negative,bored bored bored i sat in a cinema full of clearly terrified people and  was utterly bored by this grainy utterly nonscary onenote waste of 90 minutes

Feb 28 2008,negative,first vewing was good really creepy now its just annoying
Feb 27 2008,positive,someone get her a tissue or a nose plug
Feb 27 2008,negative,every copy of this movie should be burned
Feb 27 2008,positive,pretty doggone awesome and scary
Feb 27 2008,positive,this terrifying experiment in the horror genre redefined its standards for years to come chillingly effective and stomachchurningly realistic you will be scared senseless yet you wont be able to look away
Feb 27 2008,negative,scared me at 15 but really
Feb 27 2008,negative,awe inspiringly awful
Feb 27 2008,negative,made me laugh so hard i nearly wet myself horrors arent meant to do this

Feb 26 2008,positive,despite the overhype it was an innovative take on filmmaking and an enjoyable horror movie
Feb 26 2008,negative,why did this scare me the first time
Feb 26 2008,positive,good movie definitely scary and you cant deny it you dont wanna be goin out into the woods after you watch it
Feb 26 2008,positive,it made an impact on movies today and it made me sick to my stomach
Feb 26 2008,negative,i dont understand what all the hype is about i thought it sucked i was sooooo bored
Feb 26 2008,negative,weird i tought it was all real
Feb 26 2008,negative,no idea why this was a hit
Feb 26 2008,positive,you think youre tough try  to see this one alone in the dark with the sound up
Feb 25 2008,negative,my head shakes thinking about this movie
Feb 25 2008,positive,not really any replay value but this was an ingenious concept for a movie
Feb 25 2008,positive,pretty awesome but freaky i dont like the woods much anymore wtf happened 2 them
Feb 25 2008,neutral,spooky in the theater it doesnt hold up to subsequent viewings
Feb 25 2008,negative,snot thats all i can think of when i see this movie
Feb 25 2008,positive,omg scary and efficient all is suggested bad if you missed it when it was playing in theaters
Feb 25 2008,positive,this movie is excellent  it is gripping and terrifying  and you have to respect it how it evokes fear with nothing  you never see anything nothing ever jumps out and yet you can barely watch  and there is nothing to say that it isnt realist or impossible  if youve ever been out in the woods deep at night you know what its like and i know i think of this movie every time  its pretty unforgetable  i enjoy it every time  it is also very original  i recommend it as long as you take it for what it is and respect it for what it does
Feb 25 2008,positive,original horror movie i enjoyed it immensely
Feb 25 2008,negative,this movie sucked big floppy donkey dick  what a waste of my time
Feb 25 2008,positive,love it best scary film ever you can stick your texas chainsaws up yah ass
Feb 24 2008,positive,honest to god i was terrified  this is one of the only movies that has ever really scared me  most movies build suspense and then spoil it by showing something not that impressive  what most modern horror film makers dont seem to realize is that an audience is not scared by a horrible looking monster or witch or whatever there is nothing that a studio can create that will ever scare people as much as the though  throughout this film suspense builds and had they shown any more it would have been ruined this movie did a great job of leaving just enough to your imagination  not to mention it struck a  chord with one of my fears night time in the forest
Feb 24 2008,positive,if you didnt know any better you would think that it was real footage it does however sag a bit  in the middle as the three hikers basically just bitch and moan at each other for a good 30 minutes the ending needed improvement but overall this film was well done and scarier than expected
Feb 24 2008,negative,sucked how stupid ahhh im so not scared
Feb 24 2008,positive,i love this film  one of my favorites  theres something so real about it and if you are  heavy outdoorsmancamper like i am then you will enjoy it
Feb 24 2008,negative,the worst movie every made
Feb 24 2008,neutral,ok so once it came out everyone was amazed  watch it a second time now it just looks stupid
Feb 24 2008,positive,first time i seen this i was scared shitless i will never go walk about in the woods ever and fuck camping in tents i saw this film years later and it still sent a chill down my spine even though i know its all bullshit why is that i think its because we never actually see the blair witch so our imagination runs wild the end is just so freaky
Feb 24 2008,negative,terrible  did not live up to its hype
Feb 24 2008,positive,greates horror i√¢ve ever seen
Feb 24 2008,positive,remember how most of us thought this was real at first haha
Feb 23 2008,positive,i liked this movie but i didnt find it very scary and a little repetitive towards the end i think it would have been better at the movies loved the close up scared scene with the girl in the tent could just imagine the terror you would feel
Feb 23 2008,neutral,scaryyy and not at the same time
Feb 23 2008,positive,i saw this the day after it opened in theatres and knew nothing about it it scared me almost to tears not kidding i have been in situations while camping that creeped me out your mind and eyes play tricks on you and this took it to a whole new level to those who hated itpffft
Feb 23 2008,positive,more like the barf witch project righthahagood one blake
Feb 23 2008,negative,i finally saw this the other night nothing like getting lost in the woods and bitching about it for 90 minutes
Feb 23 2008,positive,original for its time and opened the door for a lot of movies
Feb 23 2008,negative,although i recognize the groundbreaking aspect of this film and does provide chills there is still an absence of a climax or any eventful action at all
Feb 23 2008,positive,this movie seriously traumatized me when i was little my yard is very wooded
Feb 23 2008,positive,totally original the best psychological horror film out there people today arent able to tell the difference between horror and gore is it scary while your watching it at home no but tell me next time your out in the woods and you hear something that you dont immediately think of this movie
Feb 23 2008,negative,the worst film i have ever seen  i followed teh hype and went to cinema to watch this crap i asked for my money back at the end  dreadful
Feb 22 2008,positive,stupid but would be fun to remake me and my friends tried and it was fun
Feb 22 2008,negative,doesnt hold up very well
Feb 22 2008,positive,the documentary on scifi channel was scarier than this
Feb 22 2008,negative,terrible camra terrible plot terrible movie 2 tumbs down
Feb 22 2008,negative,stupid stupid stupidhullofollow the damned river and you will quit going in circles  amazing cultural phenomenon
Feb 22 2008,positive,you may be unimpressed when the freehand camera movement continues throughout this disturbing chase for an enigmatic witch the acting from the beginning is realistic and totally inkeeping with the almost neorealist approach to this production the confusion of the sameeverywhere forest and inexplicable noises and movements create a feeling of totality for the audience one feels as if one is holding the camera them self though whether they want to or not remains to be seen a modern classic with an unnerving ending
Feb 22 2008,negative,eww why do people compare cloverfeild to this this sucked
Feb 22 2008,negative,this movie made me sea sick
Feb 22 2008,negative,lamest movie ever created
Feb 22 2008,positive,i thought this was a real documentary and it scared the bejezus out of me in the end  i didnt find out until several months later that it was fiction  i was worried there were crazy satanists running amok  wait  there are crazy satanist running amok  aaaggghhh
Feb 22 2008,positive,thid movie made me laugh  i know it was supost to be scarry but there were so many things that they could have done to get out of the woods like follow the river
Feb 22 2008,positive,everything a scary horror film should be
Feb 21 2008,negative,i thought this movie was stupid in 5th gradei think its stupid now
Feb 21 2008,positive,doesnt exactly scare but its interesting
Feb 21 2008,positive,freaky it scare the bejebus outta me
Feb 21 2008,positive,i have only just seen this movie in its entirety and it was actually quite unsettling and frighteningin the beginning its a basic rule of cinema what goes unseen is scarier then what is seen and this movie pulls that off greatly in the beginning when the filmmakers go around getting firghtening disturbing violenty rumors and legends from the townsfolk about the blair witch then their first few nights in the woods when they hear the faint sounds of people walking around twigs snapping and leaves crunching then around the time that they run out of the tent midway through the movie and they begin to see things but we dont thats when the frightfactor descends and the movie deflates the finale though fitting is very anticlimactic a movie worth the time but not the buy
Feb 21 2008,positive,not so good as they say
Feb 21 2008,positive,the most scary movie of 90s  really scary
Feb 21 2008,negative,i was so scared of this movie when it first came outthen i saw it  it gets half a star because it had the potential to be good
Feb 21 2008,positive,overhyped but still scary
Feb 21 2008,negative,this shudnt even be on dvd dont buy it ul be wasting ur money big time its not scary boring after the first 20 mins
Feb 21 2008,negative,i want the 86 mins of my life back
Feb 20 2008,negative,for some reason i thought i liked this movie but when i watched it later i found it annoying but im sure eric will give it five stars
Feb 20 2008,positive,i dont like scary movies but this one to me was the scariest
Feb 20 2008,positive,saw this again on tv recently one of those films that was so trendy when it came out that it inevitably suffered a trendy backlash regardless its a brilliant film and actually quite terrifying as long as you have the necessary imagination to fill in the gaps no blair witch no cloverfield too
Feb 20 2008,positive,45 minutes into this movie i was not impressed  bored even  then suddenly some godforsaken child giggled outside their tent in thr dark and i tucked my junk between my thighs and cried like a 4year old for the next hour   this movie scared the crap out of me
Feb 20 2008,positive,it was ok but it wasnt great
Feb 20 2008,negative,a couple of kids walking around the forest cursing getting scared shitless because a witch is taunting them   when i first watched it i remember the scene were the witch staked rocks and  i asked my uncle why that was scary   he said because you cant stack rocks like that with a blank look i walked outside and discovered i was a warlock  witches are cool but the girls from charmed are more frightening than this the ending can be deep if you read about it first but without any message or anything trying to show you what it meant who gives a crap  if you get lost in a forest pick a direction and walk that way and dont camp out
Feb 20 2008,negative,that was two hours of my life i will never get back

Feb 19 2008,positive,pretty good not nearly enough scares but it was still not a bad watch the idea was genius they needed next to no money to make this and they made back so so much
Feb 19 2008,positive,very cleverly promoted the fact that an indy movie could make it like this one earns it four stars alone   and yeah its pretty scary and disturbing
Feb 19 2008,negative,i know i know small budget and all that success thanks to the publicity that said everything was real but seeing it in 2012 its just a bad homemade movie that ends in a really bad way
Feb 19 2008,negative,pretty fucking stupid
Feb 18 2008,positive,i dont care what anyone says this movie scared the crap out of me when i saw it in theaters i went home thinking i heard rocks being piled outside my window i love this movie

Feb 18 2008,negative,could have been so much better
Feb 18 2008,negative,almost got sick watching this great idea but poorly executed
Feb 18 2008,negative,this movie sucked big timea totally stupid waste of time and film
Feb 18 2008,positive,you have to admitt this movie was something at the time   you werent seeing movies like this at the time  they really made it  seem like it was a realistc documentary  it also has the most intense ending in movie history   great use of getting inside our heads and playing with our minds  that is the best kind of movie is when it can get in your head and mess with your fears
Feb 18 2008,negative,i thought it was stupid

Feb 16 2008,positive,a classic yesbut only the last second is scary
Feb 16 2008,positive,my honey said this movie was real and it scared my head out and then it finished he told me it wasnt real i though the movie was amazing groundbreaking and original extremally scary the writers and directors are really clear the cinema is ment to bring realism to the audience and the audience can choose to belive it or not
Feb 16 2008,negative,works better than ipecac for having to throw up
Feb 16 2008,neutral,ruined my last few years at camp in the north woods
Feb 16 2008,positive,it was awesome until you found out that it was all a fake
Feb 16 2008,positive,yep im on of the few on the planet that really enjoyed this movie
Feb 16 2008,positive,now before you wonder why i gave the movie five stars if it sucked let me remind you of somethings people admit it or not believed it was really a documentry and i remember being so frightened before the movie even started due to rumors plus my age at the time now at the end you realized you were pulled into some bullshit but regardless you watched to see if it was true for yourself unless someone told you the ending before you saw it so that would make successful and pretty classic for the time     but that doesnt make it a good filmjust one thats gonna be talked about forever
Feb 15 2008,positive,i respect this movie because of how cheaply it was made and still put these people on the map  its an indy film makers dream
Feb 15 2008,negative,only interesting the first time you see it when you are 18 in a theater and think maybe its real 9 years laterpretty lame
Feb 15 2008,negative,i loved this movie less and less as it rolled on but they did do a great job with it ending sucked though
Feb 15 2008,positive,one of the best horror movies ive ever seen because the film allows the viewer to imagine what could be lurking in those woods and what could be scarier than our own imaginations
Feb 14 2008,neutral,in the theater this movie was unbearable its not so bad on a tv
Feb 14 2008,positive,pretty good i guess but the end is kinda sucks
Feb 14 2008,positive,i thought this movie was real for the longest time the i watched it again last night and decided i had been living a lie regardless the extras the did to make the film look more realistic earned it an additional star in my book
Feb 14 2008,negative,quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time
Feb 14 2008,positive,no one really seems to like this but this has always been one of my favourite films

Feb 13 2008,positive,you kind of had to be there
Feb 13 2008,positive,groundbreaking quite frightening  thats it
Feb 13 2008,negative,do you know that feeling when something is stolen from you yeah it hurts doesnt it thats how i felt about my time which has no materialistic value at all mind you after watching this movie    not my type of movie i guess still can score higher than a rob zombie movie though

Feb 13 2008,negative,i threw up during this film and i ran to the washroom and puked where i lost my wallet thats how bad it is
Feb 13 2008,positive,it just does not get any better than this its about letting yourself get lost with the characters and get carried along remember when that was easy as a child
Feb 13 2008,negative,a camera that makes you sick a plot that you know the ending to where practically nothing happens ever it wasnt all that special
Feb 12 2008,positive,tho it turned to be a fake story its still a scary movie to seen
Feb 12 2008,positive,it took me 8 years to finally get to see this movie  in that time id heard all the complaints about it so i knew not to expect an all out slasher flick but a more psychological film  going into the movie with that knowledge made it very enjoyable  i loved it  no real gore at all only a little blood but a lot of really creepy things going on  i recommend this to people who like psychological horror and who dont get motion sickness
Feb 12 2008,positive,just because it was unqiue at the time
Feb 12 2008,positive,ruined my sleep for 3 years
Feb 12 2008,neutral,the moment has come and gone
Feb 12 2008,positive,i liked it it wasnt the scariest movie of all time but that mightve been because alexander was watching it with me i would watch it again really

Feb 11 2008,positive,admit it you got scared the first time you saw it

Feb 10 2008,negative,so boring i couldnt sit through it
Feb 10 2008,positive,its just like cloverfield without a giant monster and instead some unknown spirit that likes to disembowel and tear apart teens oh yeah and fucking scary too
Feb 10 2008,positive,any film which manages to transcend the need for a plot gets my vote very very clever concept let down only slightly by some poorly acted terror
Feb 10 2008,negative,crap movie gave me a headache
Feb 10 2008,positive,i dont care about the post hypemystery letdown  this thing was brilliant
Feb 10 2008,negative,awful wretched terrible wasteful and many worse adjectives do not begin to describe this movie homogeneously unbearable film unqualified to entertain all but the simplest of single celled organism really bad
Feb 10 2008,negative,not scary and really how hard is it to say cuss words all the time
Feb 10 2008,positive,the love it or hate it film of the century  i happen to be a lover  it was massivly innovative very smart and wildly original  i has been knocked off a hundred times since it release but never to the same effect  the acting and direction is top notch  this is a film buffs movie
Feb 9 2008,negative,this is probably the most overhyped movie ever  i saw it opening night and was disappointed then and remain disappointed now
Feb 9 2008,positive,i love this movie i know you think im ridiculous as you read this but it scares me
Feb 9 2008,negative,the idea was cool and i liked how most of it was unscripted and the actors just did improv based on what was supposed to happen to their character in that particular scene however i didnt find the movie scary at all and i thought the ending was quite disappointing
Feb 9 2008,positive,not many scary movies scare methis one was the worstit was good and at first i thought it was real
Feb 9 2008,negative,what a load of crap
Feb 9 2008,positive,i think that movie was effective for what it was
Feb 9 2008,positive,great once but shit after that
Feb 8 2008,negative,hahaha this movie is not scary at all except in two places most of it is actually rather boring and on the verge of dark comedy worth watching for the style of filming alone plot there is no plot i like making fun of this movie
Feb 8 2008,positive,awesome movie for its timeand anyone that says they werent afraid of it is a liar 
Feb 8 2008,negative,boogers stickssticksfeetrocksstickssticks
Feb 8 2008,positive,made me fucking sick but still freaked me out
Feb 8 2008,positive,this film is quite intelligent and works on so many levels it is fake but is portrayed to be real the degree of reality in this film is astounding
Feb 8 2008,neutral,the concept was really fresh at the time almost as good as drakberget 
Feb 8 2008,positive,youtube boy scout sigil horror overrated fantastic fun merit
Feb 8 2008,positive,genious how to make a extremely tense and scary film without special effects and big budgets you make a mockumentary and this is for sure one of the best out there its just one of those movies you just have to watch because of its clever setup
Feb 8 2008,positive,everybody pans this awesome film but i think its an excellent film one of its kind and i think it can be one of the more scary films if you watch it in the dark on a loud volume if you havent seen it look past the bad reviews and judge for yourself
Feb 8 2008,negative,good for a laugh but thats about it
Feb 8 2008,negative,overrated pile of crap

Feb 7 2008,positive,hear me out on this one  i know it was done with a low budget regular video recorder  i know some of you got motion sickness  i know any country boy would have followed that creek to see where it lead out  i know they said it was a true story and made you feel like you were watching something that actually happened  the reason why i gave this 5 stars is because its not what you see it is what you dont see is what scared the hell out of me  this brought back memories of camping outside and hearing noises and saying what the hell was that  when i started watching the movie i relaxed by the time it ended i literally had the covers on my bed up to my eyes  yes is scared the shit out of me and i am not a shame to say it
Feb 7 2008,positive,chilling scary what u dont see is what really scares u the most subliminal horror the moment they saw the stones laid around their tent i believe they knew somehow they might no make it out alive the scariest part has to be the ending where they are at a building searching for their friend true horror at the last moments
Feb 7 2008,positive,i cant belive this was a scam i totally fell for it the first time i saw this
Feb 7 2008,positive,kept me awake all night after watching thiswas a painstaking movie difficult to see and stressed the hell out of yabut at the timeyou were in need of some adrenalin watching this

Feb 6 2008,positive,havent seen it in a looonnngg time
Feb 6 2008,negative,shaky camera filming wasnt very good  neither was the plot
Feb 6 2008,negative,like watching a seal with a camera strapped to his head run around the woods
Feb 6 2008,positive,a great film and one which changed the face of the modern horror film take it for what it is and the myth around it
Feb 6 2008,negative,never got the fucking pointgets out of the tent sees a pile of rocksahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhwtf
Feb 6 2008,positive,low tech horror no remakes no monsters except the ones in your head
Feb 6 2008,positive,if only the end were better
Feb 6 2008,positive,this movie attacks you mentally and physcially  mentally if you put yourself there you can start to feel yourself in it  physically becasue of all the bloody camera moving all over the place  though most part of it was boring it wasnt bad at all  the ending was something of course acting was more down to earth i gotta say so it seemed pretty well put off for me  but all in all i would watch it but not watch it if you get dizzy easy

Feb 5 2008,negative,this low budget peice of garbage was a waste of time watching
Feb 5 2008,negative,i still cannot go into woods by myself
Feb 5 2008,positive,honestly i cannot imagine why people hate this movie so much in my opinion its a near perfect modern horror remake perhaps the marketing is what ruined it for people but that makes me appreciate this movie even more that it created all that buzz and became one of the most successful independent movies ever     this is a perfect example on how you dont need to show a killer or have a bunch of gore to make a movie terrifying i can honestly say that this is one of the scariest movies ive ever seen there are a couple of scenes that leave me chilled to the bone even after repeated viewings and that ending this definitely ranks among my 25 best horror movies ever made
Feb 5 2008,positive,intense and extremely well delivered  one of the best horror films of the 90s
Feb 5 2008,positive,i like this movie because its much different from any other horrors and i applaud the creativity but i also hated alot about it
Feb 5 2008,positive,a flawed film but a good one and a real example of what can be accomplished on a minimal budget scared the crap out of me
Feb 5 2008,positive,i dont care what people say  this is a great horror film  creepy original ambiguous and tapping into a primal psychological fear  i love it so
Feb 5 2008,negative,i think this is the worst film ever
Feb 5 2008,positive,colorblacka modern day horror film that is in my mind a work of art brilliant tale of being trapped in the woods with a witch after you slowly trying to pick you off one by onecolor
Feb 5 2008,negative,i thought this movie was annoying
Feb 5 2008,negative,the worst film ever made
Feb 4 2008,positive,one of the three scariest movies ever
Feb 4 2008,positive,i was very impressed with this film not becsuse it was necessarily good but because of the way it was advertised and shot the three kids were told that the blair witch was real but the entire movie was going to be fake then the director and crew took them out in the middle of the woods and scared the crap out of them every day and night while the cameras were rolling getting truly geniune reactions from them and making the film very realistic in that way and then it was perceived by the public as a true story some people still believe it is i think the hype that was built around this film is ingenius but the film was average even though the end was kind of creepy all in all an okay indie flick but i deeply admire the way the film was made
Feb 4 2008,negative,i cheated and read the stats about the movie before watching it so i knew it was bs however as an aspiring filmmaker i watched it and was pleased about the ending for a low budget film in 1999 it was a pretty clever idea
Feb 4 2008,positive,this is clearly one of those movies you either love dearly or hate adamantly    i fall under the former    i thought this was a classic the fact that you never see the monster is what makes this work for mei mean what could be so scary that it would make a grown ass man stand in a corner in a really old abandoned haunted house     i thought this movie was pure geniusbeing put in the situations that the characters were in would have scared me shtless
Feb 4 2008,positive,yall remember this
Feb 4 2008,positive,haha i was soooo scared the first time i saw this movie and you know if they hadnt made that shitty second one this one would have been awesome
Feb 4 2008,negative,did not care for this movie
Feb 4 2008,positive,when i watched this as a kid it made me cry
Feb 4 2008,positive,the ending disappointed me
Feb 4 2008,positive,its lame now but this movie ruled nine years ago so did making homemade parodies of it not that id know anything about that
Feb 4 2008,negative,hated it drawn out and overhyped not to mention will make you sick with the shaky cam
Feb 4 2008,positive,this really got me on the edge of my seat simply done and very effective
Feb 4 2008,negative,i never understand what the hell is going on  even now i still dont really know what happened
Feb 4 2008,positive,better than most people give it credit for  truly original for its time
Feb 4 2008,negative,you know in a way i find this movie a waste cause it was like watching a damn home moviehell not very scary at all
Feb 4 2008,negative,not scary way over hyped camera work made me dizzy
Feb 4 2008,positive,pretty scary and well done
Feb 3 2008,negative,it was an alright horror film a little overrated
Feb 3 2008,positive,if you didnt see this in the first week that it came out then its ruined but if you did and you remember that feeling  holy shit  is this real or not  it didnt last long but it made it pretty amazing for just a minute plus the urban legends they spent creating the year before release were shear genius my fav is the soundtrack which only existed as a beat up mix tape that got copied and passed around on college campuses  it was supposedly a copy of the tape found in the abandoned car left by the campers on the side of the road in the woods some kids found the car vandalized it stole the tape and now you had a copy of it the last music 3 murdered teens had ever listened to great stuff too bad the suspense just wasnt built to last
Feb 3 2008,neutral,crazy i thought it was a documentary when i first saw it
Feb 3 2008,negative,the scariest movie ever    if you call bad action horrible camera work bad props and a stupid plot scary then yea it was the scariest movie ever it was a bad idea and it was horrible done
Feb 3 2008,negative,i thought it was a bumb movie sorry
Feb 3 2008,positive,there is no damn reason to rate this less than 3 stars the film is genius all you idiot film experts wouldnt know an intelligent horror movie if it bit you in the ass i agree with whoever said its the scariest movie since the exorcist the filming is perfect and certainly sets the mood there are no sex blood and drugs scenes like in every horror movie there is intelligence and the atmosphere is perfect even my thirteen year old brother can say it had an intelligent plot
Feb 3 2008,positive,excellently thought out  this is some scary shit but i like it
Feb 3 2008,negative,sorry but nomaybe i would have had more time to be scared if heather would have just shut the fuck up
Feb 3 2008,positive,i dont understand all the hate for it its become more of a fad then people actually judging the quality of the movie its not very effective at any other time but in the middle of the night
Feb 3 2008,positive,changed movies today
Feb 3 2008,neutral,blair witch project 510 i have to say the camera shakes more than i do than the movie starts off very slow but builds character development if anything watch the last five minuets of the movie because that is about it
Feb 3 2008,positive,this was interesting and creepy
Feb 3 2008,negative,who else puked when they saw this
Feb 3 2008,positive,you dont need to be gory to look scary
Feb 3 2008,negative,my god this was terrible i didnt actually finish watching it because i was so bored of watching leaves and feet it didnt keep me interested at all and im surprised how popular this is with some people
Feb 3 2008,negative,well i feel the rushed this movie the characters panicd way to early it was not scary at all i give it credit cuz it was a new styl back in the day only reason i watch it because it was the roots of cloverfield the end could have had soo much potential but it failed in all aspects
Feb 2 2008,negative,this is why i refuse to see cloverfield just because you use a hand held camera and produce a cheap film does not make it an amazing flick shitty acting shitty cinematography shitty everything
Feb 2 2008,negative,cloverfield did this right
Feb 2 2008,positive,this was good as a matter of fact when this first came out it was advertised as a true story my uncle planned a trip to blair before embarassed by friends
Feb 2 2008,positive,genial first time i saw it i thought wtf and then love came
Feb 2 2008,negative,i remember when people told me how this was the scariest movie they had ever seenand then i bought itim still regretting that purchase
Feb 2 2008,negative,oh where to begin  lets just go to family guy brian the dog has accompanied a blind guy to the cinema to see the blair witch project and provides suitable commentary it runs like this  ok the movies started theyre in the woods nothings happening nothings happening something about a map i dont know i wasnt listening nothings happening nothings happening its over a lot of people look pissed  for the hype the work of the internet etc i will give full credit but for the film its a steaming pile of monkey crap
Feb 2 2008,negative,quite possibly one of the worst movies i have ever had the displeasure to sit through
Feb 2 2008,negative,i fell asleep in the theater
Feb 2 2008,positive,the best scary film i ever watched a masterpiece
Feb 2 2008,positive,an interesting idea poorly executed
Feb 2 2008,positive,i dont know how scary it was but i appreciated the attempt to do something original
Feb 2 2008,negative,hated this movie so much it wasnt revolutionary it wasnt scary and it sure as hell wasnt entertaining i cant believe this was the indie hit of the summer in 1999
Feb 2 2008,positive,this was a great film but not for the time it was made small minded idiots think its blood and special effects are what makes a film great dicks
Feb 2 2008,negative,still not scary all these years later biggest complaint is the overacting and general lack of acting those claiming that this film replaces gore with atmosphere must have been watching another movie as the only atmosphere created is one of get a better dp and stop filming a flapping tent wall the last shot is scary  a guy standing in a corner and thats the only scary part sixty some odd minutes so i can be slightly freaked knowing that a guy standing in a corner indicates nasty supernatural death
Feb 1 2008,negative,waste of time money and effort
Feb 1 2008,positive,you gotta give em credit for making and marketing this film and getting rich
Feb 1 2008,positive,i had such a strong reaction to this film i was genuinely scared throughout and im still impressed by its believable nature
Feb 1 2008,negative,is there anyway to give negative stars
Feb 1 2008,positive,mmm  i almost belived it but obly the first one is good
Feb 1 2008,negative,if youre going to make a movie like this at least make it interesting
Feb 1 2008,positive,if you do not like scary show do not watch this but i love it it is a good movie
Feb 1 2008,negative,aahhhh  huh huh huh  aww ow im scared cuz it sucked so bad
Jan 31 2008,positive,lots of people didnt like this but if you take it at face value it really is amazing what they did with such a small budget and no gore best viewed alone in the dark
Jan 31 2008,neutral,the concept of making that much money off a film is clever the overall concept was eerie and there were a few scenes which truly scared me i think that decades of desensitization  resulted in this film being depicted as crap i dont think so not great but no worse than crossroads
Jan 31 2008,negative,damn i wish i could have gotten my money back on this one
Jan 31 2008,positive,truly scary because it seemed so real unfortunately gave way to the bs tvshows of a similar lookfeel sigh
Jan 31 2008,positive,good job people actuallly brleived it happened
Jan 31 2008,positive,this was the most terrifying movie ive seen since i was a kid i couldnt recommend it enough
Jan 31 2008,neutral,it had one of the most shocking endings but it didnt save the movie the rest of the movie just wasnt just good enough
Jan 31 2008,positive,ok i wasnt always a fan of this film upon my first time viewing it it did not impress me as i expected a scaregore fest as ive gotten older ive come to appriciate the oure terror represented in this film it is not a gore fest actually theres little blood and almost no violence the movie relies on situation and total darkness to immerse you in the enviorment and the actors did a splendeid job with realism this has a very unique point of view and i reccomend it to anyone who wants to be scared
Jan 31 2008,negative,these film school asshole spent less than 30 000  on this heap and it made millions
Jan 31 2008,negative,alrite this always confused me if the witch made them wander around in circles and get completely lost then how come their footage was found wouldnt the blair witch kill them for going into her house obviously from watching the movie thats the last place it was if it wasnt in the house thingy then it mustve gotten out right did the witch take it out how could the kids have dissapeard if they were able to get out the footage must have been with the kids so wouldnt they find a dead body near it also i dont understand how the footage would still be watchable if after a year wouldnt it be ruined from rain and crap but if it was in the house then why didnt they die from going in there or tell the police or ghostbusters o my god so confusing      movie was stupid and dumb but the end was cool in scarieness and creepiness  but otherwise stupidest fakest movie ever made
Jan 31 2008,negative,i loathe this film not because of what it is but for the string of shitty copies and parodies it unleashed upon an unsuspecting world
Jan 31 2008,neutral,effectively creepy and suspenseful the first time  afterwards not so much
Jan 31 2008,negative,too bad there is no 0star rating its on my top ten worst movies of all time list it would make a good boyscout training video of what not to do if you get lost in the woods
Jan 31 2008,negative,made me motion sick in the theater and what i was able to watch wasnt that great
Jan 31 2008,negative,hahaah i could make a better movie with two crayons a length of rope and a stick of chewing gum
Jan 30 2008,negative,watched this with my sister at the very back row of an empty theatre a cone of baskin robbins eachdefinitely memorablealmost made me puke i give it 2 stars just for the experience
Jan 30 2008,positive,great horror film so underrated
Jan 30 2008,positive,now whenever i go explore abandoned houses i always think of this movie scaaary
Jan 30 2008,negative,colordimgrayi heard the best things from this move once i saw it i fell asleep there was no violence just people disappearing this when you think of it is a remake of the haunting this movie i did not find at all scary and i live 5 minutes away from burkittsville maryland where the movie takes placecolor
Jan 30 2008,positive,i almost pissed myself while watching this movie
Jan 30 2008,positive,in terms of the suspense the film creates i think any audience has to applaud director daniel myrick for a very suspenseful film where paradoxically we do not visually see any on screen threat the performances and overall atmosphere of the film was so immense that the narrative was expressed through the acting alone as opposed to so many horror films where we have a villain walking around with a weapon in order to tell the story the cinematography and camera direction was also very expressive and really helped to convey a sense of mystery that kept the audience on the verge of insanity despite this the novelty of the film could only reach a certain level until the audience must have thought where is this heading overall i think this is a very attractive film with a perimeter of creativeness enough to make the film work though
Jan 30 2008,negative,too much hype too boring not scary
Jan 30 2008,positive,i thought this movie was real the first time i saw it
Jan 30 2008,positive,its a good concept held on to for too long  nice way of taking suspense to another level  the camcorder filming got really disturbing after the first hour but still something different so kudos
Jan 30 2008,positive,i dont usually like horror i am a big girl cant say i enjoyed it but it scared the crap out of me so i guess it did what it was suppose to do
Jan 30 2008,positive,the last scene in the house was so effective it has stayed with me for 9 years
Jan 30 2008,positive,a amazing film with a good story line and a great idea behind it
Jan 30 2008,negative,i understand this was a revolutionary movie as far as very real camera work and reallife movie aspects  that having been said i didnt really care for the movie itself  i kept waiting for something exciting to happen and nothing really did  i must say though that the last thirty seconds of the movie were actually very scary but that was about it
Jan 29 2008,negative,crap with a wobbly camera
Jan 29 2008,positive,seriously scary almost like japanese horror where one is more scared of what you cannot seemakes me never want to go camping ever
Jan 29 2008,negative,so boringwasnt even scary
Jan 29 2008,positive,lol i actually really really liked it lol
Jan 29 2008,positive,great low key horror film
Jan 29 2008,neutral,one of those movies that only works the first time i think
Jan 29 2008,negative,i will always remember the lines around the block to see this movie but it really wasnt worth it sure it was scary but by the end i wanted my life back though the ending scene is a classic
Jan 29 2008,positive,i kept on waiting for something to happen spooky parts but not enough to scare me and if you know me i am easily scared
Jan 29 2008,negative,i thought this was pathetic i dont understand what all the hype was about not scary or suspenseful at all when i wasnt about to fall asleep i was getting motion sickness
Jan 29 2008,negative,ok everyone was terrified i fell asleep
Jan 29 2008,positive,i seen it as a true story and it fuckin scared me
Jan 29 2008,positive,loved it wayyy better if u seen it when it came out
Jan 28 2008,positive,really scary the first time i saw it in the theater opening weekend  too bad it ended up getting so played out
Jan 28 2008,negative,cool early experiment with realism
Jan 28 2008,positive,great film  finally a return to what horror is about  suspense
Jan 28 2008,positive,i wish i could do a project on her
Jan 28 2008,negative,one of the worst movies ever  nothing happened
Jan 28 2008,positive,rating 0 to  12      no doubt to cash in on the release of cloverfield our local theater picked the blair witch project for their cult series this week it is however a great time to see how its predecessor stacks up      the answer is surprisingly well being well around five years since i last saw it i knew blair witch as a film that wasnt scary but very fascinating as we see these three wouldbe documentarians getting themselves lost and losing their minds in the woods the marketing campaign was also undeniably clever if not selfdefeating in its desire to be the cinemas equivalent to orson welles infamous war of the worlds broadcast now that the hype and parodies are over though we can look at one real aspect of the film that was successful      the performances of course there werent really evil spirits lurking around in the woods or were there and having crew members shake the tent is silly any way you look at it but most of what we see is unscripted and very very improvised our three actors really dont know what the other is about to do and theyre all actually pissing each other off most audiences got sick through this film but even amplified on a giant screen i could only be absorbed and eventually frozen stiff after one of the films most effectivelysuspenseful scenes the infamous conclusion         mpaa r language   runtime 1 hour 22 minutes 78 minutes of real movie
Jan 28 2008,negative,waist of time  absolute heap of sht
Jan 28 2008,positive,shit scarywatched this when it was released down at my friends house who stays down a long dark forrested road about a mile from my house and any streetlights guess who sprinted home
Jan 28 2008,negative,i was too busy being annoyed with the shaky camera and yelling to think that this was scary
Jan 28 2008,negative,give me a fuckin break
Jan 28 2008,negative,grrrrrrrr i saw this movie the other day and boy was i dissapointed it was all swearing with a few cheap scares honestly people will like it and will be scared but goddamn if it doesnt take a long time to do that yeah dont start giving me thw cloverfield bullshit im aware of the fact that the characters need backstory is stupid because its supposed to be made out like its just some tape so why give the characters back stories because thats the way traditional films are done but it isnt fucking traditional so the story is that these collage students are going into the blair witch to investigate the blair witch bullcrap anyway the ending was better than cloverfields it was creepy suspensful and even though left me going god fucking damnit it was still the highlight of the movie aside from the creepy symbol body part anyway just see the movie if you want a good scare then thisis perfect but dont expect a memorable experiance or something your going to talk positivly about
Jan 28 2008,negative,way overhyped movie i wanted my money back after it was the movie ended
Jan 28 2008,positive,to be honest part of me doesnt understand why 90 of the population doesnt like this movie i am not scared by jumpy films that rely on loud snippets of music and predictable events to scare and that is why this film physically scared me    the thing is it is filmed as though it is a documentaryreal catalogue of events and the acting matches this they made a bold decision not to show what was following them  and it worked    if they had shown the blair witch then the film would hve been crap and people would have been disappointed instead they played on sound and setting without crummy musical effects and it worked magnificently    i think the reason i liked this film was because i did not see it at the cinema the first time i watched it was on video and this made it appear more realistic and plausible    if you want to enjoy this film then watch it on your own in the dark and let the credits play for a little after the movie     a truly scary film that is if you have imagination
Jan 28 2008,positive,thats what i call scary something that u hear but can never see
Jan 28 2008,negative,for the budget to success ratio i applaud those involved but thats about as generous as this is gonna get its actually quite boring until the very end maybe if the lamps in your living room arent working you can find some fear to experience at a few key moments but other than that there is nothing remotely frightening about this movie i will give it this though it finished with a bang and i dont just mean to heathers head the second you see mike facing the corner of the basement you go through a moment of chills before the onset of the credits reminds you that you probably just forgot to turn the heat on having said that though the sequel makes you want to give this movie an oscar for best picture so rock on cult classic rock on
Jan 28 2008,negative,this movie sucked but so many people got sucked into the hype bah
Jan 27 2008,negative,i remember there was a huge hype about this movie when it first came out i saw it a couple of weeks later and i was not impressed at all
Jan 27 2008,negative,hate horror movies dont know why i go through that selftorture once in a while ugh
Jan 27 2008,positive,dude this was fing scary
Jan 27 2008,positive,this movie scared the sht out of me when i first watched it brilliant film making
Jan 27 2008,positive,it scared me but thats easy to do and camping already creeped me out
Jan 27 2008,positive,dave was inspired to scare the living crap out of me after watching this in our first flat
Jan 27 2008,positive,even with cheap camera workthese kids get into a bad situation packed with thrills
Jan 27 2008,positive,watched it last night lol
Jan 27 2008,positive,i almost peed my pants
Jan 27 2008,positive,cool idea but it lacked in plot it would have been scarier if we had actually seen the monsterwitch thing
Jan 27 2008,positive,i saw this in the theatre and it scared the crap out of me
Jan 27 2008,negative,awful but interesting
Jan 27 2008,positive,knowing the history behind mskedward makes it even scarier
Jan 27 2008,positive,interesting concept but not scary at all
Jan 27 2008,negative,this movie was crap no plot and no real acting this movie is a joke
Jan 27 2008,positive,different  certainly an intriguing premise  the documentary style was neat  good thrills at points  without giving away anything what happens with each of these filmmakers and thus the legend itself is kind of weird  allinall pretty well done worth a watch or two
Jan 27 2008,positive,arguably the most profitable film in history with a budget of us22000  a film gross that was more than 11000 times its original budget    creepy especially considering the antogonist is not on screen at all the documentary way this is filmed captures the emotions all the characters are going through in a very believable sort of way definitely worth the watch
Jan 27 2008,negative,this film was only successful when its marketing misled the cinema going public into thinking that it was put together from real true life footage removing the element of mystique generated from a supernatural snuff film you have a bunch of very uninteresting people walking around in the woods doing a bunch of very uninteresting things
Jan 27 2008,negative,when i finished lauging i remembered that this was meant to be scarey then i made the fatal mistake of sitting through it to see if it would get any better dont do it kids time is precious go and do your tax return instead
Jan 26 2008,positive,i never liked the blair witch project when it first came out i didnt find it scary or anything however i do have it on dvd and having watched it a few more times ive come to really appreciate the ending i actually get shivers when i watch it now not bad for a mockumentary film
Jan 26 2008,positive,pretty friggen scary for not actually showing any of the antagonists aka the blair witch the ending was creepy as anything ive ever seen though im suprised i havent seen it till now
Jan 26 2008,positive,a simple and brilliant idea creates one of the most purely terrorizing films of the past ten years  with nothing more than a few breaking sticks the pitch black of night and few piles of stones three actors and everyone watching are shredded down to their emotional breaking point    the verdict a mustsee one trick pony that deserves all the recognition it has received    
Jan 26 2008,positive,jesus  i havent seen this for a few years but it still managed to scare the hell out of me even though i knew how it ended  goosebumps
Jan 26 2008,positive,sure theres no payoff but i loved this
Jan 26 2008,negative,a cheap knockoff of mallrats it makes no sense in the end the kids find out the witch works at the gap so what the fuck
Jan 26 2008,positive,i loved this moviei thought it was brilliantly done and the fact that they made it first person made it all the better
Jan 26 2008,neutral,innovative on the first go round pretty lame upon further review
Jan 26 2008,positive,one of the only horror movies that i actually liked  the acting seemed real like they were actually experiencing the emotions not just faking them  interesting to see how extreme paranoia quickly sets in after dark
Jan 26 2008,negative,upon additional viewings its just another movie that never quite scares and is not scary at all
Jan 26 2008,positive,ill never watch this film again it made me be scared of the back of the sofa
Jan 26 2008,negative,camera moved around way too much made me sick
Jan 26 2008,positive,scary with nothing actually
Jan 26 2008,positive,not my thing a little shite
Jan 26 2008,positive,give this to a person that has never heard of it and tell them its real footage
Jan 26 2008,positive,the ad campaign was awesome  the movie was surprisingly formulaic but still quite entertaining
Jan 26 2008,negative,all i remember is her bubbling snot the only good scene is the last shot
Jan 26 2008,positive,the infamous hit thats become synonymous with queasy violent camerawork the blair witch project had a clever marketing campaign that wanted to accomplish the same thing as orson welles war of the worlds radio broadcast did by convincing us before we watched the film that this was actual footage and the three filmmakers depicted were tormented by an actual witch now that the hype and the parodies are done with and we have another film rightfully reclaiming its throne cloverfield its time to give the blair witch another look while not extremely scary and definitely silly in the scene where it tries the hardest shaking the tent ah lowbudget filmmaking the escalating conflict between our illfated characters is unmistakably real perhaps excessive in fbombs but their descent into madness is undeniably compelling
Jan 25 2008,positive,first of its kind was fairly effective but very stressful to watch had some good scares but it moved rather slow it felt like what the hell was going on at the end
Jan 25 2008,negative,kudos to the filmmakers for having a creative concept and great job by the marketing team but in the end this really sucked a symptom of an overstimulated population craving bells and whistles rather than just enjoying a good old fashioned story blech i really freakin hated this
Jan 25 2008,positive,haha i was scared to turn of the tv when the movie was done p
Jan 25 2008,negative,one of the most overrated movie of all time  an hour and a half of my life i will never get back
Jan 25 2008,positive,this movie still gives me goosebumps when i think about it
Jan 25 2008,negative,saw this when i was way younger scared the crap out of me
Jan 25 2008,negative,this movie was so boring and it felt like it went forever but it wasnt actually that long its stupid you dont even see the witchif there even was onesupposedly that makes it scarier but i didnt find it scary at all
Jan 25 2008,neutral,made the mistake of watching it alone in someone elses house stupid movie but at 2 am in a strange house alone extreme anxiety p
Jan 25 2008,neutral,this movie freaked me out when i was younger
Jan 25 2008,positive,using the unknown to bring audiences everywhere to the brink of insanity directors eduaro sanchez and daniel myrick do just that when they cast a group of snotty easily pissedoff teenagers to stay in the woods for what seems like a week or so even though the film becomes repetitive with constant fighting and bickering between the group of kids the ending is somewhat of a shocker  totally unexpected even to this day i keep thinking that these events were real and not scripted
Jan 25 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me
Jan 25 2008,positive,best movie ever  only movie that scares the shit out of me at the end   its a must see
Jan 25 2008,positive,a milestone in cinematography  this did for film what war of the worlds did for radio
Jan 24 2008,positive,couldnt understand it
Jan 24 2008,negative,these chumps owe me some money
Jan 24 2008,positive,interesting concept but its ultimately a one trick pony that doesnt play well outside of the theater
Jan 24 2008,positive,admit it when it first came out it was freaking amazing
Jan 24 2008,positive,for the actual storyline i give 3 and a half stars but for marketing ingenuity i bump up my overall score to 4 and a half stars this is how you make a movie take an original concept and market the hell out of it dont tell the audience what it is until they actually see it i cant begin to wonder how many people actually thought what they were seeing was real documented footage rather than cheap production values and handheld cameras a movie that grosses over 11000 times its original budget should always be remembered and studied
Jan 24 2008,positive,um wowdnt kno how 2 rate tht
Jan 24 2008,negative,the worst movie ever
Jan 24 2008,positive,this movie scarred everyone when they thought it was real then everyone found out it wasntso everyone said it sucked wtf
Jan 24 2008,negative,i should watch this again  at some point  in a few years 
Jan 24 2008,positive,it was quite convincing it seemed quite real you dont really see anything but because it seems so real its really scarry
Jan 24 2008,positive,uh i just love this film that everyone else hates i think it is really scary my kinda film
Jan 23 2008,positive,url  plot   three students go nito the wooods in search for the blair witch then fate tyurns their way     opinion  this was a well created movie and was a shock for me i loved the ending it was so captivating and was so original it made me urn
Jan 23 2008,positive,this will really scare the shit out of you
Jan 23 2008,positive,the scariest movie i think ive ever seen in the aspect that everything goes unexplained  after watching this movie it feels like you have just escaped a nightmare but a brilliant nightmare at that
Jan 23 2008,negative,this movie fucking sucked
Jan 23 2008,negative,go into woods hear funny noise shine light onto trees see nothing  next day wander around woods get lost pitch tent  hear funny noise shine light onto trees see nothing  repeat ad nauseam  characters so stupid they deserved to die  woeful pants

Jan 22 2008,negative,horrible horrible horrible
Jan 22 2008,positive,brilliant imho i love how simple it is and how the three actors make it so tense and the screams so chilling i can still watch it at night with a friend whos never seen it and get the creeps
Jan 22 2008,positive,a really great movie for the sole reason that it still scared me like hell even though i never even saw any gore blair witch anybody die or anything it truly proved that the presentation is everything great idea put into practice
Jan 22 2008,positive,i love scary movies and the unique way this was made

Jan 22 2008,negative,heathers screaming got irritating very quickly  highly overrated
Jan 22 2008,positive,that 90s snuff flick gets one star for the scifi channel special  loses one for the godawful sequel
Jan 22 2008,positive,i really do not understand why i liked this movie so much

Jan 21 2008,negative,stupid i cant stand this
Jan 21 2008,positive,if someone pointed a camera at me the whole tripblair witch is not the person he ought to fear
Jan 21 2008,negative,was it supposed to be scary
Jan 21 2008,negative,the story scares me but thats really about it its actually a very very stupid movie
Jan 21 2008,positive,this is a perfect example of a low budget horror film that is actually frightening to an extent whether you like it or not it really does do a somewhat good job of convincing the audience that everything going on is 100 real
Jan 21 2008,positive,the original viral ad hit
Jan 21 2008,negative,wasnt really that scary and just sort of made me feel dizzy
Jan 21 2008,negative,weird story line if any shaky scenes  just dont like it
Jan 21 2008,positive,talk about backlash from initial high praiseill never see it again but it scared the piss out of me and i liked it  debates on this usually concluded that if youve camped you were scared but maybe thats just us
Jan 21 2008,negative,if i wanted to get motion sickness id fly somewhere
Jan 21 2008,positive,so fucking good one of the scariest movies i have ever seen

Jan 20 2008,positive,was a pretty bad movie but if i was camping n we had a portable dvd player id definately watch it again
Jan 20 2008,positive,i know this movie caught alot of shit for being cheaply made and for never really showing any witch but i think thats what made it a good movie although the shakey freehand camera shots did make me a little queezy at first
Jan 20 2008,positive,amazing film scary as hell lol great acting
Jan 20 2008,positive,purely terrifying the tension builds up way before the terror begins excellent pacing and brilliant acting the newwave way of shooting the film is amazing and breathtaking the ending left me stunned pure panicstricken goodness and so real sound effects play a huge role and its insanely creepy better than most if not all adrenaline pumping horror flicks
Jan 20 2008,positive,an awesome lowbudget horror movie fails to have a lot of rewatch value on account of the shitty improvd dialogue
Jan 19 2008,negative,so benign it is interesting  i could have lived without this
Jan 19 2008,positive,why dont more people like this movie i thought it was brilliant intense and creepy
Jan 19 2008,negative,kathryn and i could have done better when we were 5
Jan 19 2008,neutral,not as scary as i had heard
Jan 19 2008,positive,not one of my favorites but it is pretty up there you have to admit the first time you watch this without knowing it was fake makes you really scared about camping the build up is phenomenal an its acting was grade a as well as its ending which you dont see anything to me thats a lot scarier than some cgi 40 foot witch on the screen it was definitely a wellmade low budget film and like it or not it definitely was welldone cinema considering the techniques that were used
Jan 19 2008,positive,horribly underated one of y fav movies of all time so frikkin spooky man
Jan 19 2008,negative,fucking annoying shite gets half a star as thats the lowest i can give
Jan 19 2008,positive,not scary i mean scary maybe for people who never watch horror flicks but good
Jan 19 2008,negative,words cannot convey how angry i was that i wasted my time in this movie was advanced screening so i didnt pay none the less i was robbed of 2 hour sof my life for this crap these people had a brilliant idea and marketing concept and then they completely bollocksed it up by making an utterly anticlimax lame useless pointless gonowhere stupid ending i mean what utter morons
Jan 19 2008,negative,trust me its too late to see this one
Jan 19 2008,positive,i am so scared i dont know whats out there we are going to die out here i am so scared    major movie studios frequently pour tens of millions of dollars into hightech horror extravaganzas and they die at the box office within a matter of days a few independent filmmakers venture out into the woods with handheld cameras and an extraordinarily lowbudget to back them up and they score a muchhyped highlyacclaimed box office bonanza  the blair witch project originated as a deceptively simple ultra lowbudget independent feature slowly this smalltime film developed into one of the most chilling creepy films of its time it took unsuspecting audiences entirely by surprise and scared other movie studios whose gigantically budgeted films were running in fear from the tiny movie    the blair witch project is distinguished for various reasons first of all it is incredibly eerie atmospheric and unpredictably exasperating secondly compared to most other horror films of the time it is innovative and clever blair witch did spawn its own subgenre as a result these guys wrote the rulebook for the found footage genre and filmmakers have adhered to it ever since cloverfield anyone thirdly it was made on a shoestring budget and returned a mint in box office profits fourth it used the internet to fabulous promotional effect fifth after all these years it has become more of a phenomenon than a conventional viewing experience and lastly it instils a sense of less is more leaving a lot more to the imagination than most other fright flicks    by now all and sundry should be aware of the movies gimmick in october of 1994 reads the prologue three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentary a year later their footage was found the documentary being filmed by the students was a college project about a local legendary figure known as the blair witch allegedly the three youthful filmmakers died under mysterious circumstances in the woods while trying to complete the documentary and their bodies never turned up    heather donahue michael williams and joshua leonard retaining their real names for heightened realism take a video camera and a 16mm film camera as they hike through the black hills forest in search of evidence in relation to the existence of the blair witch who has supposedly haunted the forest since the 18th century and is credited for scores of heinous murders they interview local townspeople before embarking on a hike into the forest they are soon inexplicably lost and morale rapidly deteriorates the filmmakers are tired hungry angry and hopelessly lost as tension mounts they realise theyre also being haunted and probably stalked by some unknown presenceand there is no way out    im afraid to close my eyes im afraid to open them    heather captures virtually everything with her video camera with the intention of assembling a behindthescenes look at how her documentary was made heathers camera is on practically all the time  to the point that her companions continually tell her to turn off the camera as the unseen evil hunts them they realise theyre not filming a legend but a descent into unimaginable terror    naturally every word of blair witch is fiction the movie is a complete forgery but it was made and promoted so cunningly that countless people worldwide thought it was real prior to the films theatrical release a site for the blair witch project was launched as of the films tenth anniversary this website is still online it offers insight into the completely false myth of the blair witch although the film is 100 fiction na√Øve moviegoers witnessed screenings at their local cinema believing everything to be true    its not the same on film is it i mean you know its real but its like looking through the lens gives you some sort of protection from whats on the other side    blair witch is a film where ignorance is bliss  or to be more accurate in this case utter terror ostensibly the final testament of a film crew who disappeared off the face of the planet the movie bears a resemblance to an authentic documentary which makes this is spinal tap seem like a david lean epic  ahead of its theatrical release the film fooled many american college students who were shown the film  the ruse in this case was abetted by a surplus of apparently legitimate missing posters seeking information concerning the whereabouts of the apparently lost youngsters such screenings helped spawn the positive wordofmouth that directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez knew would be unquestionably vital if their little film was to be a success its air of mystery was definitely the films strongest selling point  featuring little in the way of stars special effects or even competent cinematography the directors could hardly claim much of a notable cinematic track record either but the pair shared an adoration of 70s horror flicks and decided to pool their meagre income for a feature that would endeavour to evoke the visceral terror they felt upon initially viewing william friedkins the exorcist    because this is america weve exhausted all of our natural resources    codirector sanchez recalls the experience we were after complete realism we knew that if we did it with a crew it wouldnt work from the beginning we wanted to do blair witch as an improvised film we were basically going to leave the actors for certain amounts of time on their own tell them what was happening and let them shoot it for a couple of hours at a time then wed come back review the footage and go on to the next scene but it was the input of gregg hale  a onetime special forces sergeant  that ensured the film a place on the horror hall of fame he reportedly said when i was in special forces training they put us through this pow camp scenario and after about two or three days of being in that camp surrounded by these guys hitting you and yelling at you in russian and not letting you sleep and hosing you down with water you start to believe that its really happening you know we could do this to the actors myrick and sanchez were delighted at the idea    so it was that a trio of unknown actors found themselves pretending to compose a film concerning the fictitious ancient woodsdwelling witch while being truly petrified as the film crew deposited ominouslooking stick men in their path or played tapes of children crying in the middle of the night we were the blair witch myrick reminiscences we had to get up at three in the morning and run around their tent we had to hike through the woods to drop off directing notes then wed review heathers video tapes at the end of the day to see how it was reading on camera    flames are licking you like the devil there josh    the element that makes the blair witch project unusually gripping is the atypical presentation every scene is a pointofview shot shown exactly as one might expect from someone carrying around a video camera the transitions are unexpected and often jarring  what wed expect if the camera was turned off at one point then turned back on later the most chilling sequences transpire at night when the darkness foils the video there are instances when the screen is entirely black and all we hear is the audio  the panicked voices of the protagonists in the foreground with strange macabre noises in the background at other times the action depicted is chaotic often because the person doing the filming would be running or unsure what to capture these segments rely on the imagination of a viewer to fill in the gaps what our minds conjure up is always more horrifying than anything the filmmakers can put on screen also this seemingly haphazard and unprofessional technique gives the audience a you are there feeling that draws them into the experience everything that transpires is hence more shocking and immediate than it would seem in a conventional format    the trio of actors are uniformly excellent for amplified realism the filmmakers had to genuinely scare the actorsand they did there are a few traces of artifice though usually when characters are having a conversation oncamera but due to the improvisational style of acting its easy to get engaged in the problems of these characters when heather offers a tearful apology towards the end its utterly heartbreaking    there are things to nitpick though for starters its preposterous that the camera is on for so long once one is in danger why bother filming anymore i doubt anyone would keep filming under these circumstances however the key fault is the occasional lack of realism for example the trio all have mentioned loved ones who would be aware of their expedition any parent whose offspring doesnt show up merely hours after they are due home would call the police and launch a search the filmmakers endue for dayswithout a search party in sight surely the police would have also been informed of the proposed camping trip as well and wouldve launched a search when they didnt return home theres also the flaw of character stupidity one character reportedly gets rid the map because its useless  not good enough and theyre surrounded by tall trees why not climb up to the top and see where you are why not find higher ground in order to spot a way out the film also seems undercut at a bit under 80 minutes in the faux interviews on the official site they mention about 20 hours of recovered footage so its obvious were missing out on a lot of stuff but the most lethal setback is simple once you realise it isnt real the film is not scary at all it isnt competent enough to truly convince a viewer it is real overuse of profanity and the aforementioned character stupidity occasionally kill the illusion however it is pretty chilling with the grating screams of heather or the eerie sounds coming from pitch black    its fairly riveting though it depends on how you view it if one watches it in a dark room at night with no interruptions and youre paying 100 attention it may work better if its light and youre not paying much attention youll hate it    you gonna write us a happy ending heather    the blair witch project is notoriously inventive  both in its creation and marketing  but its a victim of its own hype once you discover it isnt real youll no longer find it scary yet its an innovative nontraditional horror movie that ushered in a new genre titles like diary of the dead cloverfield and rec drew inspiration from this film the ending is very creepy and irritatingly ambiguous especially if you want to believe the films universe and faux mythology available on the official website the blair witch project has lost much of its original impact be that as it may the combination of cinema verit√© and fake documentary filming occasionally generates some hairraising horror scenes    ok heres your motivation youre lost youre angry in the woods and no one is here to help you theres a witch and she keeps leaving shit outside your door theres no one here to help you she left little trinkets you took one of them she ran after us theres no one here to help you we walked for 15 hours today we ended up in the same place theres no one here to help you thats your motivation thats your motivation
Jan 19 2008,negative,lots of twigs screams and snotters  ill give it a star for the innovative way it is shot and acting is ok  had more impact on first viewng but has nothing to offer as a movie you can keep coming back to

Jan 3 2008,negative,this is the only movie i fell asleep watching in the theater opening night i understand how many felt this movie repesented of the changing of the guard if you will in cinematography but i couldnt do it the movie took too long to unravel and no amount of cinema trickery in this case simplicity is going to replace a storyline and plot which this movie did not do enough to keep my attention this is a hate it or love it movie depending on whom you ask put me down for the former

Dec 31 2007,negative,horrible and makes you sick because of the way iy was filmed
Dec 31 2007,negative,probably the most overhyped horror movie ever being original just for the sake of originality is never a good thing what amazes me is that audiences completely bought into it despite its lack of quality artistic and otherwise
Dec 31 2007,positive,the movie may have been lame and slow but the last scene was pretty creepy
Dec 31 2007,positive,this was actually pretty good but the sequal sucked ass

Dec 31 2007,positive,im one of the few people that really liked this movie  after a decade of screams and knowing what happened last summer someone finally attempted to be original
Dec 31 2007,negative,possibly the worst movie ever made definately top 5 worst films in the history of the planet just go into the woods with a camera and someone you dont like then spend an hour bitching at each otherthen make up a bunch of lies about it and see if you cant trick the world into liking your movie too

Dec 30 2007,positive,well its a landmark cant fault them on quality to budget ratio but having seen this looong after the hypein places tedious
Dec 30 2007,positive,argue if its real or not the documentary approach is still unsettling its the type of scary where the bad guy doesnt pop up and say boo and we all jumpno its the type where if youre lost in the woods and you hear what sounds like cracking all around you in your tent and you cant see anything
Dec 30 2007,negative,this movie was stupid

Dec 30 2007,positive,haha surprisingly i liked this

Dec 30 2007,positive,fresh and real scary for me
Dec 29 2007,positive,the best part of this film was all of the hype during its limited release days
Dec 29 2007,negative,it seems so silly in hindsight
Dec 29 2007,positive,now often parodied this was original and groundbreaking back in 99  my contention is that it still is and will be for some time  its one of the highest grossing movies of all time if you look at what it cost to make vs take  bonus  no slasher crap gore
Dec 29 2007,negative,stupid pretentious movie
Dec 29 2007,positive,too many people dont get this film

Dec 28 2007,positive,either you will reject the concept or be terrified
Dec 28 2007,negative,so bad its scary  the camera work offers a mild tinge of realism but this film really isnt anything to write home about  its not a classic if it doesnt hold up well over time
Dec 28 2007,positive,the blair witch project is the most effective horror movie i have seen to date if i had seen it when it came out i would have thought it was real its just that good

Dec 27 2007,neutral,ending was sort of disappointing

Dec 26 2007,negative,i grew up in the woods so i found this movie so god damn boring i fell asleep i awoke for the ending but it wasnt worth it
Dec 25 2007,positive,one of the scariest movies ive ever seen when i saw it the first time in the theatre years ago i could barely sit in my seat then i recently saw it againstill scared
Dec 25 2007,negative,watched it twice in one night cause i had to good idea shite movie
Dec 25 2007,positive,remember the hype for this movie it was fucking massive along with titanic ofcourse
Dec 25 2007,positive,this film has probably no reply value at all ive only seen it once but i think once is all you need  if you let yourself become immersed in the film for the hour and half i dont think you can be too disappointed
Dec 25 2007,negative,saw it in theaters thought it was worth a penny
Dec 25 2007,neutral,the handy cam things cool initially but the movies more irritating than scary on the whole and yeah i watched it only now

Dec 24 2007,positive,i cant rememberis it hip to have wanted to see this movie before it was successful or after  forget what is hip if you like being scared and let yourself like this movie you will be scared and like it  if you are more interested in all the stuff about this movie not on the screen then dont see it  i was scared and i liked it
Dec 24 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me  i was 20 years old
Dec 24 2007,positive,i think its still gd
Dec 24 2007,negative,not a movie why is this even here pathetic
Dec 24 2007,positive,no doubt its creepy and worthwhile but i have issues with the ending
Dec 23 2007,positive,its really not as bad as people make out i think blair witch made use of an inventive and previously unheard of filmmaking process and remains as unnerving now as it did in 1999
Dec 23 2007,negative,i thought this movie was totally crap  nothing scary at all  waste of time and lets all go home now
Dec 23 2007,positive,sure it was interesting and a neat concept but i dont get the sensation it caused when it first came out
Dec 23 2007,positive,im a sucker for horror films  this is top notch and original

Dec 23 2007,positive,filmed as a documentary this one really is the perfect horror movie to watch before going to bed 
Dec 23 2007,neutral,the first and last 10 minutes are good  its the hour of pointless cussing in the middle thats the problem
Dec 23 2007,positive,i avoided this for years then finally got it as a 1 weekly video if you dont watch it and pay attention and see the very last 5 secondsthen it doesnt work if you do then it is bloody brilliant sent chills down my spine    ps the people whining about the camera work and advertising are missing the point i feel sorry for you its a film that can only be watched once and you need to go through the experience with the characters i watched it again recently after about 4 years and it just didnt work i knew the ending
Dec 23 2007,negative,why did this scare anyone
Dec 23 2007,negative,i think the only people who really really enjoyed it were the ones who thought it was real it was creepy and the ending was pretty spooky but i went in knowing it was fake that just teaches me to see movies opening weekend what i remember the most is wanting to throw up on my lameassboyfriendatthetime then take some dramamine
Dec 23 2007,negative,lot of fuss about this movie at the timei hated it i actually felt physically sick while watching it the bit at the end spooked me though when she found her friend leaning against the wall
Dec 23 2007,negative,god this was awful
Dec 23 2007,positive,one of the few horrorsuspense films that actually scared me
Dec 23 2007,positive,not as bad as everyone thinks if you take it for what it is
Dec 22 2007,positive,as much as people mock it this is a genius little horror film in that it will really freak you out if you let it cheap but effective elegant is the word
Dec 22 2007,negative,interesting concept that sparked a ton of interest but overall pretty crappy
Dec 22 2007,negative,almost a complete waist of time
Dec 22 2007,positive,a bit boring but still a gd movie
Dec 22 2007,positive,pretty scary flick neat idea too
Dec 22 2007,positive,really good horror moviethe plot seems very real
Dec 22 2007,positive,very good horror movie  the end is absolutely spine chilling a very good movie with an almost indie feel pity they had to make a sequel which was bound to suck
Dec 21 2007,neutral,i dont know how to rate this still in the dark as to what i sat and watched for hrs
Dec 21 2007,positive,first of its kind not for those with motion sickness
Dec 21 2007,positive,freakin scary if u put this on late at night with lights off
Dec 21 2007,positive,this score is based solely on the movie as a film and not as a marketing scheme
Dec 21 2007,positive,the first time i saw it it totally freaked me out
Dec 21 2007,positive,well it succeeds scared my ass off
Dec 21 2007,positive,extremely underrated for reasons i can never figure out  people who thought it was real and then found out it wasnt are probably the ones who are the most angry
Dec 21 2007,neutral,the first viewing experience in the theater was interesting and i thought it was a bold effort
Dec 21 2007,positive,antony shorty this movies a classic so up yours lol
Dec 21 2007,positive,this movie as so stupid but i mean i guess since its a doc it was good
Dec 21 2007,neutral,good to watch for the first time but its an indy film with too much hype
Dec 21 2007,positive,loved it it scared the shit out of me and left a lasting impression on me    such innovation in movies is so hard to come by and even harder to relive
Dec 21 2007,positive,was praised and then slated by the critics i thought it was great
Dec 21 2007,positive,i really loved it even though its produced in hollywood i love the indie feel of it and truthful attitude its great could watch it again sometime
Dec 21 2007,negative,definately a fresh concept but it made me want to vomit on the guy sitting in front of me
Dec 20 2007,negative,awful  the most boring uninteresting horror film of all time  well its top five material at least
Dec 20 2007,positive,good concept well executed and downed ultimately by the overpowering hype that built up around it still a well made movie though and deserved its success from the clever promotion alone
Dec 20 2007,positive,really effective probably because it leaves a lot to the imagination and produces a physiological responce of fear that works backwards to amplify it
Dec 20 2007,negative,get out the gloves this movie was bullshit a onenote wonder maybe just maybe it could have been a watchable short pure marketing genius pure horseshit gimmicky filmmaking flukepuke
Dec 20 2007,negative,it was so dumbbbb
Dec 20 2007,positive,whacked out have you ever watched it while you were high
Dec 20 2007,positive,im one of the seemingly few people that likes this movie in fact i really like it scared the shit out of me for years still does the aim of horror is to scare and it does that for me  period
Dec 20 2007,negative,would you believe that this was the second movie that i ever saw with a boy and it was the worst choice he could have made    the first movie he took me to was called bats  i highly do not recommend it
Dec 20 2007,negative,boring as fk what was with the hype
Dec 20 2007,negative,saw it dont remember dont care
Dec 19 2007,positive,the first time you see it it really gets you
Dec 19 2007,negative,seeing how i have seen it i have to give it atleast half a star according to this rating system it would be nice if i could give negative stars because this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Dec 19 2007,positive,scare tha fuck out yall ass
Dec 19 2007,positive,such a good film and its creepy
Dec 19 2007,positive,was good at its time not that great when put out on dvd sighs
Dec 19 2007,negative,thanks for wasting my time
Dec 19 2007,positive,i followed the online marketing for this one for almost the entire year leading up to the film or however long it was marketed online and i didnt give a crap that it was fake it made it all the more interesting then i finally saw it and it was everything i expected  awesome
Dec 19 2007,positive,i watched it alone in an empty cinema without knowing what the movie was going to be about and was scared s love the ending
Dec 19 2007,positive,sheer brilliance forgotten today amidst heaps of ripoffs and reworkings that have killed this subgenre of horror in recordbreaking time the difference between this and its predecessors is that the blair witch project used the realist possibilities of the method of found footage as means to conceal the physical threat and let sounds and mood do the real frightening while the mindless joyrides that followed just used it as another way to frame their fantastical monsters if you let it this film can scare you in ways that others just cannot the medium of film itself is used to a new potential in fact unlike any other horror film this one has indexical qualities everything in front of the camera actually happens the way we see it there are no digital manipulations no special tricks if you let it this can be one of the most rewarding haunted journeys one can take in the movies
Dec 19 2007,negative,didnt live up to the hype but wasnt terrible either
Dec 19 2007,negative,very unscary  i waited for the horror part but it never really came  own it on dvd
Dec 19 2007,negative,the most overhyped movie of my childhood what the hell was so scary i dont get it
Dec 19 2007,positive,i freaked when i saw this it played with my head
Dec 19 2007,positive,scary shizzle but i didnt really understand it
Dec 19 2007,negative,well its not often that words fail me  and this isnt one of those times however ive already used my swearing quota for this week so i shall return in due course with a review that would make danny dyer blush
Dec 19 2007,positive,i dont really know how this is possible but this is the one horror film that scares me  seriously the only one  the end of the film with the guy in the corner  still scares the shit out of me
Dec 18 2007,positive,just seen it online as cant get the dvd anywhere well i like it the beginning of the film was shot well and kept me interested till the end i have no complain for the shaky camera as we know this is a documentary style    the ending was rather abrupt the shouting still creeps me out the house the hand print and last seeing mike standing there was a high light but still nothing that great    rec is definitely a great documentary for horror movie but being this is made in 1999 and with a cheap budget well done    610
Dec 18 2007,negative,classic crap ending was ok
Dec 18 2007,positive,this movie kinda sucks you dont like it while youre watching it but you like it more after you watched it and you think about it but youll never watch it again
Dec 18 2007,positive,the creepiest and most believable documentary ive ever seen extremely good
Dec 18 2007,positive,solid performances and the bestyet use of pov handcamera doesnt make up for the films various flaws chief among them is an unlikable cast of characters so unlikable in fact that i had to stop watching the movie and come back to it hours later after my frustrations cooled
Dec 18 2007,positive,fricken hilarious movie not scary at all
Dec 18 2007,positive,i still dont think ive gone camping since could have been better though
Dec 18 2007,negative,i shut it off it was so bad
Dec 18 2007,positive,shut up this was a great idea and they actually pulled it off
Dec 18 2007,negative,all mouth no trousers
Dec 18 2007,positive,lets not analyse my mark here ok
Dec 18 2007,positive,not a fabulous film but certainly the most original movie to be made in twenty years of horror films
Dec 18 2007,negative,over hyped and ill delivered rubbish
Dec 18 2007,negative,scared the hell out of me
Dec 17 2007,negative,not as scary as everyone said it was goofy
Dec 17 2007,positive,this movie is revolutionary and one of the greatest thrillers in recent history the documentary style brings heavy realism and character sympathy which makes the story and the fright that much more engaging you have to go into the film with the right attitude and let it do its job ive seen so many spoofs but the original idea is still genius
Dec 17 2007,positive,this is the scarest movie documentary whatever you want to call it that ive ever seen in my entire life
Dec 17 2007,positive,ive only seen it once in the movie theater and i lived near there and knew it was fake and it still scared the crap out of me
Dec 17 2007,positive,only really scary if you believed the hype about the video being real     at the time i didlol
Dec 17 2007,positive,the first time ive ever actually freaked out while watching a movie
Dec 17 2007,negative,not scary really stupid
Dec 17 2007,negative,probably one of the worst movies ive ever seen it was dumb fake documentary it even says its not real so i have no clue why people think it is overall the movie was very lame and not worth seeing like ever terrible story line
Dec 17 2007,positive,i saw this in theaters and then had to walk home in the middle of the night through a car lot past a funeral home a prison a swamp and a freaky diner that was playing oldies outside
Dec 17 2007,positive,the only horror film that gives me shivers if u let yourself go n let it absorb u pretend your in the woods with them that last scene is freaky
Dec 17 2007,negative,what a piece of beep totally overrated
Dec 17 2007,negative,wipe your nose already
Dec 17 2007,positive,v bad snotter moments but love this film
Dec 16 2007,positive,the plain ol woods is the scariest setting
Dec 16 2007,positive,this is soooo funny
Dec 16 2007,negative,absolutely stupid shouldnt have even been made movie not even scary at all totally dumb
Dec 16 2007,positive,this movie scare the pants off me i may be in the minority on that one but i dont care i sat there in that theater feeling thinking what would i do if that were me thats all it takes to fill the chrill run up your spine as the handheld camera is knocked to the ground in the final shot
Dec 16 2007,negative,heres the thing about blair witch for those who thought it was real it must have been incredibly scary but as soon as it was revealed to be fictional the entire effect was lost its an interesting if very dated bit of film history
Dec 16 2007,negative,spoofworthy before it even premiered
Dec 16 2007,negative,might be the worst movie ever
Dec 16 2007,positive,effective in its simplicity yet ultimately leaving you wanting those hours of youre life back best watched wasted
Dec 16 2007,positive,after all the hype and antihype fade away i think its a good movie
Dec 16 2007,negative,i really just hate this movie there is nothing scary whatsoever about seeing 3 assholes wander around in the woods for 2 hours i will never understand what appeal this movie has for some people
Dec 16 2007,neutral,shaky cam made me naseaous
Dec 16 2007,positive,this film is neither all its cracked up to be nor all its cracked down to be i give it major props for at least trying something interesting a nominally new approach a horror without guts and prosthetic effects it works if you can get by the sheer ridiculousness of having characters who are fullout shrieking in terror managing to keep looking through their cameras that is one big pill to swallow however if you have ever been out camping in the middle of nowhere and heard weird noises at night  well this movie captures that and then some not a masterpiece not a failure interesting
Dec 16 2007,positive,only film that has scared me
Dec 15 2007,negative,if you go down in the woods today youre sure for a big surprise  this is a film that looks like it was made by students for students  if trees and extreem camcorder closeups scare you this could be your film
Dec 15 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me when i was little
Dec 15 2007,positive,creepy pretty much a must see for horror fans
Dec 15 2007,negative,the hype was amazing the film wasnt what ever happened to the director duo did they go back to maryland and disappear
Dec 15 2007,positive,this movie was creepy in its own little way and it seemed like it was real and all the stuff that was happening in it was also real but it wasnt but i still liked it
Dec 15 2007,positive,i still love this despite watching it sooo many times  scares the bejeezus out of me
Dec 15 2007,negative,i remember when we watched the ending of this in christian ed afterwards kc stood in the corner behind one of the televisions and would not come out good times good times
Dec 15 2007,positive,personally i think you need to see the fake documentary they had attached with this movie to get a full understanding    however the concepts behind the making of this movie and utilizing one of the first kinds of viral marketing make this a very unique horror movie    and like a few say the last shot just does give you a little bit of the creeps
Dec 15 2007,negative,this film was funny
Dec 14 2007,negative,unfortunate for us viewers its incredibly hard to choke on your own pity snot
Dec 14 2007,positive,this was a well planned movie i mean the actors went into hiding for 5 years before returning and saying it was fake this movie was so beleivable its not funny it made people beleive in things even to this day people still watch it  i personally love it and it will always go down as opne of the best ever planned movies
Dec 14 2007,positive,scary shite if youve ever camped in the wild
Dec 14 2007,positive,the natural eerie feeling is mind blowingunlike the made up beefcake imaginary shit with blood and masks
Dec 14 2007,positive,scared the absolute shit out of me
Dec 14 2007,negative,absofreakinlutely hilarious  a friend and i watched it at my house in fifth grade the same night the cartoon network was doing their scoobydoo marathon the scooby doo project and we flipped back and forth between the two  but seeing them turning innocent scoobydoo into a looselysimilar plot to the movie freaked me out more than the movie itself did  and then we spent the rest of the night trying to spook one another out  gratuitously ridiculous
Dec 14 2007,negative,i saw it and didnt get it when i was young
Dec 14 2007,positive,the idea that everyone wishes they had come up with first  the shaky handheld camera techniques and improvised acting might turn off some its not a traditional movie by any means  however those shaky nauseating techniques and the spurofthemoment acting makes it all the more realistic original and utterly terrifying  the only movie that ever kept me up at night
Dec 14 2007,positive,very weird and scary movie
Dec 14 2007,positive,very scary and this movie is real
Dec 14 2007,positive,i watched this movie i shit my self simple i was one of the people who believed it was reallool
Dec 14 2007,neutral,very hyped up when this first come out i can see what the makers where trying to do but i was just left thinking well what the fk was it i was left very unsatisfied
Dec 14 2007,neutral,stupid  the end still manages to creep me out though
Dec 13 2007,negative,i just find it comical now
Dec 13 2007,negative,it made for a good idea to steal for a german project
Dec 13 2007,positive,still kind of freaky now
Dec 13 2007,positive,excellent movie making concept assuming you dont get motion sickness
Dec 13 2007,positive,geez this movie has so many inside jokes attached to it one of them will pop up on a daily basis
Dec 13 2007,positive,scary as hell i thought it was a true story the way it was shot and cut i was relieved to find it was fictional but imagine if it really happened
Dec 13 2007,positive,i had not seen this movie since i was about twelveyearsold which is how old i was when it first came out and i only saw it once because its slow and nongraphic so therefore boring right but having seen it again now and realizing how wellcrafted it is well holy crap the three main actors improvisational skills are amazing and the fact that they the shot most if not all of the footage themselves alone in the woods adds to the increasing creepyness throughout   this is a film that knows how to build suspense from the getgo and despite how bloodless it is that last scene remains one of the scariest things ever it will definitely get under your nerves and remain there
Dec 13 2007,positive,i liked it clever idea and marketing  usually hate shaky cam but since it was used as a story device didnt mind it and the screaming of the children in the woods still creeps me out
Dec 13 2007,positive,this is a classic film something that never had been done before  the promotion campaign for this film was one of the best in history  what really makes this film special though is how it makes you think  you dont see almost anything your mind fills in the blanks  you have to use something most of us forget about your imagination
Dec 13 2007,negative,by far the worst movie ever made
Dec 13 2007,positive,haha after that movie you wount go in the wouds
Dec 13 2007,neutral,a low budget phenom congrats to them
Dec 13 2007,positive,decent lowbudget horror flick
Dec 13 2007,negative,it was only a buzz
Dec 13 2007,negative,i hate this movie was the worse movie i have ever seen
Dec 13 2007,positive,fascinating film experiment really gets under your skin the key to the films effectiveness lies in its resolution to show nothing
Dec 13 2007,negative,bullshit and more bullshit
Dec 13 2007,negative,i wish i could give this overrated piece of shit a negative score or at least a zero
Dec 13 2007,positive,it made these people rich  mustve done something right
Dec 12 2007,negative,the black hole of suck
Dec 12 2007,positive,tell me where you are josshh still freakin scary in my book
Dec 12 2007,positive,give it four stars only because it is horrorthriller and i usually dont like this genre but this one is special in this movie there are not many actual images of horror you get scrared by your own interpretation of the scenes  very obscure and you dont want to be walking in the street alone after seeing it so realistic
Dec 12 2007,positive,hmm ive never seen this movie from the beginning to the end but i still remember that this is okay
Dec 12 2007,positive,even though this wasnt real this was a good movie
Dec 11 2007,negative,thats what the hype was about
Dec 11 2007,positive,innovative not only for its original concept but for its pervasive marketing powerful and effective i also watched this at a great time in my life immediately after hitchhiking newfoundland and while that added to to some of the believability it also may have detracted from a bit of the realism required viewing for literacy in modern cinema
Dec 11 2007,positive,scared the hell out of me the first viewing
Dec 11 2007,positive,not that badpretty scary
Dec 10 2007,negative,was this shit supposed to be scary
Dec 10 2007,positive,this was sooo scary i saw it when it first came out when everyone thought it was real
Dec 10 2007,positive,original premise original cinematography but in the end i didnt sympathize with the characters i laughed at them heather before shes lost in the woods america has destroyed all of its natural wilderness heather after she and her friends have become hopelessly lost in the woods this isnt possible there arent any natural woodlands left in america
Dec 10 2007,negative,at the end it looked like one of the blokes was pissing against the wall while the cameraman fell overoverhyped turd
Dec 10 2007,positive,holy crap i thought it was real for like hours the ending was really good definitely not the scariest though
Dec 10 2007,negative,what a crock of crap
Dec 10 2007,positive,drippy noses and fucked unsatisfying endings suck balls
Dec 10 2007,positive,either you love it or hate it  movies never scare me but i walked out of the theatre shaking
Dec 10 2007,negative,the world would be better if this film wasnt made its exactly 87 minutes of wasted time you cant even say its bad  its just boring and its not scary at all
Dec 10 2007,positive,brought something new the supposed realism makes some chicken skin
Dec 10 2007,negative,exprted way too much on this one
Dec 10 2007,positive,wow i havent seen this film for nine years since i went to see it at the cinema for my 15th birthday where i wore clunky 90s heels as i recall i swear i either went to see a different film or i invented it all up in my head this is completely different to how i remembered it    i thought there were more eyes  hat shots and at the end i thought we actually saw the witch figure standing in the corner  how jumbled up i was    in fact i enjoyed it a lot more this time probably because i am more intelligent and not so preoccupied by wooo at the cinema on my own with my friends seeing my first certificate 15 because im quite used to this style of film now  i think back in 1999 everyone thought this was really weird and cheap but this style makes it so much more realistic and chilling see rec particularly the voodoo bits in the trees and the sense of helplessness when they realise they are going around in circles    it also made me think about what was happening to them in a much more indepth way why were they getting lost is it a feature of the wood or is there some greater force present what noises did they hear at night and how was something able to creep up to their tent and leave offerings without being noticed and most of all who on earth was carrying the video camera in the last 20 seconds     i think this film is so undervalued for what it is and the effort they went into producing this so it looks the real deal is a great testament there are also loads and loads of theories as to what actually happened leaving the film open to interpretation and oooh i do like that in a film 
Dec 9 2007,negative,the only thing worse than this movie is its sequel
Dec 9 2007,positive,although everyone is saying that this movie is crapi liked it and it is one of very few horror flicks that ade me shiver with fear at night
Dec 9 2007,negative,this whole movie was crappy  although the end did freak me out  but that was it
Dec 9 2007,negative,theres a lot of snot that comes out her nose
Dec 9 2007,positive,shot like a fly in the wall documentary that captured scariness like none other  superb
Dec 9 2007,negative,this movie was completely retarded until the very end when quite suddenly and for a very short amount of time it got totally freaky
Dec 9 2007,positive,agreat and brilliantly creative film
Dec 9 2007,positive,excellent movie for its more realistic approach to horror realistic as far as horror movies go anyway i dont scare very easily when it comes to films but this one still creeps me out today
Dec 9 2007,positive,slated by many but in my eyes a true horror classic no other film has put u so close to the action and the subtlety of the scares allows your imagination to create horrors that are worse than anything that could of been filmed
Dec 8 2007,negative,this was a waste of money really
Dec 8 2007,positive,what not seen is much terrifying than what is seen which explains why i always laugh out loud when i watch jhorror while this movie just scare the shit out of me
Dec 8 2007,positive,brilliant in concept and execution  frightening for every outdoorsman
Dec 8 2007,negative,i was told this was supposed to be scary instead it looked like some crappy home movie
Dec 8 2007,neutral,definitely not as interesting or scary as i remembered it still though those scenes where you cant see anything and dont know whats happening can be pretty unnerving
Dec 8 2007,positive,the end was fuckin spooky when mikes in the corner my god good movie though
Dec 8 2007,positive,i enjoyed it on the first watch
Dec 8 2007,negative,this was the one of the crappiest movies i have ever seen  i will give it the groundbreaking mockdoc style but for serious who  would have kept the camera rolling and what did they have a 20 year battery  over all it just made me sick to my stomach
Dec 8 2007,positive,this movie scared the shit out of me i loved how it really relied on your imagination to fill in what wasnt on the camera which in my opinion was scarier than them showing us some lame witch monster thing
Dec 8 2007,positive,tension and creepiness on a budget worth seeing once  the premise isnt as original as it seems the notorious cannibal holocaust used the same idea decades before  avoid if you are prone to motion sickness
Dec 8 2007,positive,i never did get to see the blair witch project when it was originally released pity because it would have scared the living shit out of me as a kid blair witch proves that suggestion will always always be scarier then whatever scary thing someone decides to put on screen the film leaves you in the dark about everything and as such you know no more of the characters situation then them themselves sure the people act stupidly at times but thats another aspect that makes the events seen so much more real people will act recklessly when all hell is breaking loose around them ominous wooden figures popping up everywhere children laughing outside the tent the fact that no matter what way they go they cant seem to leave the forest its fuckin creepy blair witch is one of those few horror movies that make the dark seem a little bit deeper and menacing even after its ended
Dec 7 2007,positive,the wacky stuff no tracable story arch adds up to cult movie not a classic
Dec 7 2007,negative,a bit too boring for mei got seasick from all the jumpiness of the scenes
Dec 7 2007,negative,kinda weird didnt really explain what was going onlol

Dec 6 2007,positive,the marketing for this movie was brillant  the  ending really unsettling
Dec 6 2007,negative,didnt scare me at all nosferatu was fucking scarier than this garbage also if i didnt know any better id say this movie was intended to be a comedy they all acted like idiots if you see a river when you are lost you fucking follow it down stream maybe they should have used their brains instead of running around the woods like chickens with thier heads cut off
Dec 6 2007,positive,from a business standpoint this movie was brilliant by using what is moreorless a new technique it kept the budget at a bare minimum didnt even need to hire a screenwriter and it pulled in a lot of audiences and a lot of horror fans enjoyed it    although they do succeed in making it seem like a documentary which makes sense given that it was almost entirely ad libbed and the director wasnt on set instead leaving notes for the cast explaining what was required of them and then making noises around them all night it just ultimately doesnt work as a horror movie i saw it shortly after it came out on video and at the time i didnt find it scary despite being a total wuss back then and none of the characters are likeable particularily because theyre all really stupid    and i thought it had excessive profanity me somebody who has seen mallrats more times then id care to admit im not saying blair witch had more just that it seemed more out of place    fortunately some promising titles such as cloverfield and diary of the dead are using similiar technique because this movie certainly wastes it
Dec 6 2007,positive,very original and realistic made me very paranoid
Dec 6 2007,positive,gets old but actually scary at some points
Dec 6 2007,negative,lol what a joke of a film
Dec 6 2007,positive,i will never camp in the woods again
Dec 6 2007,positive,pretty damn scary made all the more freaky by the fact it is all handheld camerawork thank goodness it wasnt real
Dec 6 2007,positive,expectedly disjointed but enjoyable and suspenseful nonetheless

Dec 4 2007,positive,i went camping the night i saw this
Dec 4 2007,positive,i watched it again recently alone and in the dark and i think this movie really works its power of course is that you never get to see or know whats really going on

Dec 3 2007,positive,lord i dont know how anyone ever thought this was real but never the less some parts are really original for a horror film and the last scene took the cake and really really terrified me
Dec 3 2007,positive,hmm when i saw it i actually thought it was a documentary until i looked it upp so while watching it some parts were kind of boring and i was thinking this isnt scary in the slightest after the movie the fear started to sink in more p

Dec 3 2007,negative,terrible not even close to how good i thought it was gonna be a couple scares but nothing spectacular
Dec 3 2007,positive,5 stars for turning 40 grand into 40 million
Dec 3 2007,negative,one of the worst horror film ive ever seen i got a huge headache afterwards theres nothing scary about it some people think it is a good film because they created a website to bring up the hype thats a huge hoax about the witch in blair that killed those students who actually filmed the whole incident i paid 9 bucks for a cheap home video that lied to us that its a real documentary film when its a cluster of basic cinemagraphic tricks anyone can do its clear that the film is fake and its worthless this can worth something if only they lie to us into believing this is real thru their website im glad when they won the worst actress award from razzie award and nominated worst picture it also won some good awards like most promising producer anyways this is a either youlikeitverymuch or youhateitverymuch movie theres no middle ground to this thats why the average is a 4 and 12 star
Dec 3 2007,negative,what ruined it for me was everyone laughing in the audience
Dec 3 2007,negative,rips off cannibal holocausts gimmickbut nothing happensalright ending though
Dec 3 2007,positive,saw this one at the theatre on releaseday and it was one of the best theatre experience ever at that time it was a lot of mystery around the movie i dont think people who see it today can get that feeling it was so quiet after the movie and it was a creepy atmosphere in the air
Dec 3 2007,negative,my family home movies are twice as scary
Dec 3 2007,positive,stunning movie really basic and cheap but that has no effect on the quality whatsoever this was the beginning of a whole new era in horror

Dec 2 2007,negative,i laughed at the end of that movie
Dec 2 2007,negative,the ending was great but everything else was the shits
Dec 2 2007,negative,this film was just plain stupid
Dec 2 2007,positive,i first saw this movie when i thought it was real not sure why i would ever imagine they would show a evidence of murder in a theatre but i did  anywho i will give it marks for the use of the net to sell it as real since it was early in the days of the net
Dec 2 2007,neutral,they tried to market this film as if it was a true story and on that note it managed to scare the living shit out of movie goers around the world looking deeper inside youll see a fairly clever albeit low budget generic horror flick about a bunch of stupid kids being hunted by a creepy mythological witch
Dec 2 2007,neutral,i wanted to kill that chick
Dec 2 2007,negative,this was about as scary as belly buttens
Dec 2 2007,positive,saw it in the movies and hated it i rented it at home and i liked it a lot actually never watch this movie then go camping its not good
Dec 2 2007,negative,boring uneventful and on top of it all they tried to pass it off as a true story
Dec 2 2007,positive,this keep me up all night in a good way scared the hell out of me
Dec 2 2007,positive,very cool at the time
Dec 2 2007,negative,i dont see what the fuss was with this movie it wasnt very good
Dec 2 2007,neutral,very disappointed i missed the boat with this admittedly ive only just seen it for the first time 8 years after its release but as a film its more interesting for its impact on cinema the industry than cinema the artform logically it makes no sense  why would heather hold the camera at face height for the entire film after a couple of days of being scared shitless the last thing on her mind would be recording everything for prosperity and to say they spent the whole film being scared of the wind and stick men hangin from trees the fact that at the end they selflessly race into a terrifying abandoned house looking for their friend makes no sense believeable acted but if you take the boring bits out the film would last about 10 minutes still ill give it an extra star for trying something a bit different and interesting just a shame it doesnt work the film works better as an example of the power of suggestion than as a horror film
Dec 2 2007,negative,i saw this when i was 16 and my best friends were like this is ssoooo scary and amazingokay no it was dumb and im rating it lower because it was hyped to be so good and it was stupid
Dec 2 2007,neutral,novel idea but the hype hugely overweights the end result
Dec 1 2007,negative,i dont know what the big fuss back in the day was all about it would cost me more to take the bus nowdays than the budget of this movie
Dec 1 2007,negative,complete waste of money to rent this film i could make this on my own
Dec 1 2007,negative,i saw it after all the hypetherefore i was disappointed
Dec 1 2007,positive,it feels so real and it creeps me out s
Dec 1 2007,positive,i thought it was creepy its the kind of scary that lingers even after you havent seen it for a long time
Dec 1 2007,positive,not scary at all but a little intense and very wellmade camera and acting wise
Dec 1 2007,negative,i hate this movie   i hate it because it is horrible to watch take your gravol folks youre gonna need it due to the perpetually shaky camera is painfully boring and despite trying to be innovated  they failed miserably  i wasnt scared i fell asleep
Dec 1 2007,neutral,freaky but over the years it has lost its sting
Dec 1 2007,positive,i am one of the people that this movie scared the crap out of
Dec 1 2007,positive,scarred the crap out of me when i watched it for the first time
Dec 1 2007,positive,i was scared already going to the theater
Dec 1 2007,positive,interesting to say the least  i didnt see the whole thing so i missed out on some of the details
Dec 1 2007,positive,pretty original writing and concept
Dec 1 2007,positive,i know its not real and most people hated it i thought it was a great concept and very well done for what they were trying to do the legends they built to go around it were very good and the movie made you want to find out more
Dec 1 2007,positive,good but why did he toss the map
Dec 1 2007,negative,i kicked it in the creek
Dec 1 2007,negative,barf retarded and overrated
Dec 1 2007,negative,overrated boring teen histrionics and not enough real horror
Dec 1 2007,negative,how did this make it to the cinema
Dec 1 2007,positive,probably would have freaked me out if i saw it when it came out on the theaters but its only a comedy now
Nov 30 2007,positive,so many people hated on this movie but i think that it was pretty brilliant and these guys were laughing all the way to the back
Nov 30 2007,positive,this is terror  enter the woods and never return  yes      always rise
Nov 30 2007,positive,fuck shit up with this movie  it is kill  love it always never give up    good horror    i love it to death
Nov 30 2007,positive,one of my favorite comedies
Nov 30 2007,negative,i didnt understand the ending
Nov 30 2007,positive,well made and brilliantly marketed student horror film that riffs off cannibal holocaust but delivers some extremely spooky atmosphere strong acting and unnervingly creepy moments that will never make you want to go camping  works better if you think its a real documentaryoops
Nov 30 2007,negative,going around in circles  keep crossing a river  maybe try following the fucking river  rivers do not flow in circles
Nov 30 2007,negative,ive endured some stupid crap at the cinema over the years but this one takes the cake the sorry tale of three foulmouthed cretins lost in a forest is relentlessly mediocre and pointless  production values are nonexistent camera work insane at best and the script is worse than death the characters are boring vacuous morons who spent the film getting very lost committing heinous acts of stupidity swearing gratuitously and fighting and bickering so annoyingly that frankly their deaths come as a blessing
Nov 30 2007,positive,spoiler warning    conceptually the blair witch project has to be heralded as one of the most spectular phenomenons in movie history  a simple story which doesnt really go anywhere beyond a legend which is completely fictional  filmed on a shoestring and forgoeing any expensive makeup effects or creepy bogeyman costumes  using a bare minimum of scare tactics the blair witch project worked at least until it was revealed that the story was not true    still you cannot deny its brilliance that a movie that cost 1100th the cost of most modern horror pictures managed to put so many bums on seats    its a shame it opened the trapdoor for so many parodies and wannabes
Nov 30 2007,neutral,this movie actually scared the  out of me when i first saw it the second time i watched it it was just boring
Nov 30 2007,negative,thought it was clever when it came out
Nov 30 2007,negative,the marketing of this film was more effective than the film itself if you get motion sickness bring a barf bag biggest wet blanket wtf ending in horror history
Nov 29 2007,positive,made me motion sick
Nov 29 2007,positive,well  have to give them points for originality
Nov 29 2007,negative,after seeing the bland witch project now i can understand why so many people ran from the cinemas screamingthey wasted 10 for nothing this fictional documentary within a pseudodocumentary form may be the most overrated underfinanced piece of film to come down the pike in a long time where is the suspense where is the involvement where is the identification the spectacle of three filmstudent types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid we know from a printed foreword that the three young filmmakers are doomed and by the time i got to know them a little i didnt much care what happened to them
Nov 29 2007,neutral,this was a huge deal at the time
Nov 29 2007,negative,what a great hypedriven hoax
Nov 29 2007,negative,real movie made way too fake

Nov 28 2007,positive,i saw it before the hype was revealed to be lies at that time it was scary as all hell
Nov 28 2007,positive,nothings happening i think theyre lookin for a witch or nothings happening something about a mapnothings happeningits over alotta people in the audience look pissed    brian from family guy
Nov 28 2007,negative,i dont get it not scary to me
Nov 28 2007,positive,killer xcellent idea execution and marketing def a must see
Nov 28 2007,positive,the scariest movie ever made i cant even go outside in my own backyard after watching it to this day every time i view it it still feels like the first time spectacular    edit 2 12 stars fuck you flixster users
Nov 28 2007,positive,not as scary as i thought not even close but it was interesting
Nov 28 2007,positive,the marketing they did with this movie was ingenious and is taking into account how much it cost and how much it earned one of the most successful films and by the far the most successful independent film ever made ive youve ever been lost its a great scary flick again a loveitorhateit kind of movie i loved the openended ending
Nov 28 2007,positive,over hyped but still entertaining
Nov 28 2007,negative,i hated this movie so much id rather have beaten off with broken glass in my hand
Nov 28 2007,negative,never got this film  probs never will
Nov 28 2007,positive,parodied to death  but i still think it works when viewed fresh
Nov 28 2007,positive,take away all the hype of the scariest movie ever made and sit down and really let yourself get drawn into it it comes out out a pretty decent attempt
Nov 28 2007,negative,what in the gay hell
Nov 28 2007,negative,when i was younger my friends and i took a video camera and made a ripoff of this movie in 1 day  it was still better than this piece of garbage  seriously a shaky camera and arguing isnt scary
Nov 28 2007,positive,one of the best horror movies ever made
Nov 27 2007,neutral,the film was original during its time 1999 but with its overhyped propaganda the film got on my nerves bad the movie started out well it gave insights on the witch before the three campers ventured into the woods then thats where the film fell apart though some scenes were suspenseful and scary most were shaky and the plot of the film was getting confusing and weird but the ending was the most shocking part  nothing happened highly recommended if youre interesting in reminiscing the old 90s other than that pass
Nov 27 2007,neutral,not great now and not great then just average
Nov 27 2007,positive,more chilling than a fullfledged horror movie  one thing blair witch certainly gets right is the use of atmosphere the fear of the characters makes for several convincing spinetingling scenes as they are stalked through the woods by persons unknown    however the running length and style get the film in trouble  even for and under 90minute movie blair witch feels overlong there are just too many scenes of minor squabbling though the later more intense scenes where people start breaking down are welldone    this movie also loses major points in my book for being arguably the first to introduce the world to shaky nauseating handheld photography  its effective here but the effect doesnt want to make me throw up any less
Nov 27 2007,negative,it has taken me a long time to finally see this movie and i must say i was severely disappointed i appreciate the spare filming and noseeem attitude often attributed to directors like m night shyamalan and movies like the haunting however the difference between them and this movie is that the others knew what they were doing this film did not as a viewer we see hardly anything and it does not work to the movies advantage the fact that we are seeing absolutely nothing the entire length of the film doesnt offer enough in the way of a good tease that makes us tense instead i found myself sighing often and rolling my eyes at the often unbearably tedious dialogue the film shows us way too much daylight time with a bunch of teens running around swearing as much as possible and yelling at one another i wanted to see more dark time and i wanted more of their socalled terrifying experience the film had a few good ideas such as the strange noises in the night but did not offer quite enough of them usually i am happy with a movie that knows how to hold off on showing too much but this film couldnt find a happy medium in a paper bag all in all the film does not hold up and when the end finally came all i could think was huh it amazes me that when this film came out people thought it was real because i could spot the fake like a neon sign big thumbs down for me ill be avoiding the sequel as well really this movie couldnt scare me even if i was on a hiking trip myself
Nov 27 2007,positive,nice concept for filming too bad it is fake
Nov 27 2007,negative,i fell asleep in the movie theater during this one  seriously
Nov 27 2007,negative,pretty crappy then i cant believe they tried to make it out in the news that it was a real event and then the actress and actors show up in other movies the movie sucked wasnt even scary the only reason it gets two stars is because the story was interesting and might have actually been a good movie if it was a real movie instead of a fake documentary
Nov 27 2007,negative,this movie was terrible i rate it 0
Nov 27 2007,positive,in my experience you either love it or you hate it what most people fail to get about this movie is that the scary part is what you dont see and how you empathize with the characters
Nov 27 2007,positive,watching this movie thinking it was a true story made it suck but thinking back on it it wasnt all that bad part two was better though
Nov 27 2007,neutral,sucked if i remember right
Nov 27 2007,positive,it a ver very very very scary movie
Nov 27 2007,negative,if you look really close you can see up her nose

Nov 26 2007,neutral,not as gd as it looked
Nov 26 2007,negative,how scary can you make a home movie
Nov 25 2007,positive,me and a friend hi olof watched this without knowing anything about it it was some rip we found and didnt know if the movie ended or if the ending was missing extra point for nostalgic moment d
Nov 25 2007,negative,i felt sick after film because of camera shaking
Nov 25 2007,positive,at the end i nearly shit ma pants    it was really good tho 45 for sure also really classic hopeless fear factor
Nov 25 2007,negative,i did not enjoy this at all didnt know what all the hype was about
Nov 25 2007,positive,i want to see whats happening
Nov 25 2007,negative,good for some laughs hey just like cats
Nov 25 2007,negative,stupid and not scary
Nov 25 2007,positive,i thought this was very scary not because of what may have been out there in the woods with them but just the thought of being lost in the middle of nowhere was enough
Nov 25 2007,negative,wait this wasnt supposed to be funny im confused
Nov 25 2007,negative,the scare factor being lost in the woods is a classic reality kind of fear the acting was completely ludicrous and absurd the script was also not wellthought out has suspense but does not show the end result
Nov 25 2007,negative,even my cousin who was 4 at the time laughed at this movie  what a waste
Nov 25 2007,positive,scary stuff scary ending i thought
Nov 25 2007,negative,jesus christ if there is a god why would he allow something like this to get made
Nov 25 2007,negative,meh it wouldve been more effective if it wouldve been condensed although the last 10 mins or so actually creeped me out
Nov 25 2007,positive,a scary documontaire even its not real in the house is scary
Nov 25 2007,negative,good idea not good enough for a full length film
Nov 25 2007,negative,everyone says its true but i dont really know whether or not to believe it i guess ill have to see the next one but as far as scare factor it was pretty good
Nov 25 2007,negative,this is just plain stupidity allover
Nov 25 2007,positive,superbly made  depends on whether you watch films for entertainment or to try and learn something about technique i do the latter and it taught me a great deal about improvisation hence the 3 stars
Nov 24 2007,negative,who really thought shakey cameras and people facing corners was scary
Nov 24 2007,negative,i remember being scared out of my mind as i watched this especially at the end but feeling incredibly stupid for being scared in retrospect a good one to watch with a big group of friendsand not one youd want to watch in your basement in the dark alone
Nov 24 2007,positive,freaky  you never know whats really happening and it could totally be real
Nov 24 2007,positive,dated now but lets not forget how fucking freaked out this made people when it was first shown
Nov 24 2007,positive,great movie low budget but well done very scary if you have a good imagination
Nov 24 2007,positive,in the end it worked for me because i was really questioning if this was real or noteven though i knew beforehand that it wasnt the creepiest part and actually one of the only really scary parts was the final scene which left you with quite a spook
Nov 24 2007,negative,the greatest thing about this was that it was filmed different nothing else
Nov 24 2007,negative,dont really love or hate this movie more of a  film that tries to play tricks with your brain than a  horror film this is the harvey danger of movies was never supposed to get as big as it did and now everyone hates it
Nov 24 2007,positive,seen it was a little freaky but an ok film i guess
Nov 24 2007,negative,i cant believe ucf students made this
Nov 24 2007,positive,geniusthe only genuinelly fucked upnterrifying movie ever if you werent prepared to let yourself go with this then youve no imagination
Nov 24 2007,negative,one of the worst and pointless and stupidest movies ive had my eyes unfortunately see it is a total waste of money and time
Nov 24 2007,positive,gave me the creeps big time and i am not easily scared by any stretch of the imaginationlove the way it didnt feel the need to be gory to be scarycleverly done
Nov 24 2007,positive,hmm interesting project actually
Nov 24 2007,negative,did not see what all the hype was all about for this
Nov 24 2007,positive,this is so terrifying the scariest thing about it is that you can not tell if it is a documentary or a movie
Nov 24 2007,positive,i had to look online to know whether this movie was real or not it is seriously scary because it is very believable i loved it
Nov 24 2007,positive,this is a genuinly scary movie what is scarier than being totally totally lost in the woods
Nov 24 2007,positive,i didnt really like this movie but the impact it had on film is huge
Nov 23 2007,positive,a great low budget horror movie which relies on the psychological  and quite effectively i remember the hype before and just when it was released  i actually saw one of the first midnight screenings which made it even more memorable just like many other surprise successesin true tall poppy fashion the blair wtich project is now plagued with unwarranted criticism for a film that cost 22000 to make and grossed 248 million worldwide  its one of those movies which has been hard to match
Nov 23 2007,negative,honestly scared the shiate out of me never saw the end
Nov 23 2007,positive,call me a sucker this scared me to death
Nov 23 2007,negative,if you still believe this was real you should see a shrink
Nov 23 2007,negative,worst move i think i have ever seen
Nov 23 2007,neutral,as a horror fan i expected more with all the hype that surrounded it
Nov 23 2007,positive,probably overrated but still a nice movie on its own  especialy considering the cool style of the movie
Nov 23 2007,positive,this actually kinda scared me the storys pretty good
Nov 23 2007,positive,at the time it seemed really creepy  i dont ever need to see it again though
Nov 23 2007,negative,why was this film a hit
Nov 23 2007,positive,great idea and execution
Nov 23 2007,positive,this is the last good horror film to  have come out really well done the saw movies are complete bullshit
Nov 23 2007,positive,i nearly  my pants at the end when i saw this in the theatre
Nov 23 2007,negative,if any film has wasted my time most this may be one of them i can see clearly what the hype was all about when this came out in 99 however since it has been revealed to be fabricated the film merely stands as a highly creative marketing ploy in history the realistic acting and camerawork is jerky and pathetic its not an orginal concept as well  anyone know what a mockumentary is
Nov 23 2007,negative,it was cute back then now is just a funny memory
Nov 23 2007,negative,dont do it dont watch it the biggest hoax in history although the end did leave me feeling a little disturbed
Nov 23 2007,positive,i remeber in school you were hard if you had seen this movie  even though we were all too young to get in p my dad got me a copy and a few of us gathered round to watch in ours and turns out it was not really all that scary though i do respect it as its unique and different
Nov 23 2007,negative,a film to cause vomit
Nov 23 2007,negative,this movie was the single greatest waste of 87 minutes of my entire life  it is nothing more than a bunch of goddamn retards running around in the bush with a handheld camcorder  the con artists who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves  i saw this movie for free in the theatre and i made the mistake of sitting through it  if they showed even 5 minutes of this to the detainees at gitmo i would be forced to call amnesty international because that would be cruel and unusual punishment this was also the last time we allowed my cousin to decide what movie to go see because he picked this steaming pile of shit a must avoid for children of all ages
Nov 23 2007,positive,this is prolly the most profitable film in the history of cinema the idea is genius but the film wasnt that good but it looked authentic and that was the real point keep in mind that the characters are the ones making the film
Nov 22 2007,negative,too much hype in a clever way but really
Nov 22 2007,neutral,dudeim all likelike that was a trip dudelike maybe we could have made that movie huh bro
Nov 22 2007,positive,a great movie to see once

Nov 22 2007,positive,this movie freaked me out until i realised it wasnt a real story
Nov 22 2007,positive,this scared the mess out of me  it was terrifying without the gore and obvious fiction  it made me scared to walk in the woods
Nov 22 2007,positive,went camping after this one lol terrifying but sooo much fun
Nov 22 2007,negative,avoid it or youll be sorry

Nov 22 2007,positive,not very scary but resourceful and original
Nov 22 2007,positive,watched it together with steph and barbie when it first came out  a few people in the theater got motion sickness  it was crazy  something fun to do at 1145pm  worth the tickets
Nov 21 2007,negative,this wasnt even scary it was lame
Nov 21 2007,positive,i watched this on videotape one night knowing full well that i needed to take the garbage out afterwards  well that was a mistake
Nov 21 2007,neutral,alright say what you will about this movwell theres a lot to the contrary
Nov 21 2007,positive,it was so scary and the filming was really brilliantly done
Nov 21 2007,positive,this was scary until everyone found out it was fake
Nov 21 2007,positive,at first i was mad about how it ended you get built up to see her then nothing it scares you more later it sticks with you they made you think it was real and the way they made the movie made you think it was real just very creepy
Nov 21 2007,negative,one of the worse films i have ever seen
Nov 21 2007,positive,a fantastic movie that suffered from overhype if you had simply run across this at a film festival or a smaller theater youd be talking about it for years but as it was you go in expecting an epic and it cant sustain that burden but seriously id like to see anyone who bad mouths this movie do something on a budget so slim and reap returns the way bwp did
Nov 21 2007,positive,one of my fave horror movies of the last decade for 16000 you cant go wrong
Nov 21 2007,neutral,i couldnt wait to see this and i went opening weekend  i was very very disappointedbut the end was kinda creepy and bumped the rating up to 25
Nov 21 2007,positive,this was the first movie in a lonnnnnng time that truly creeped me out i rmember seeing it in the theatre and going home to my apartment in a woodsy area no less and looking over my shoulder freaked out seeing mike standing in the corner at the end still gives me a chill everytime i watch
Nov 21 2007,positive,i think i peed my pants in the theatre when i saw this of course im a wimp
Nov 21 2007,positive,being a big horror fan it isnt really right that ive not seen this until now but at least i finally have  right ive heard mixed opinions from a couple of people but my own is that it is very good the hand held camera thing was fresh then and welcomed and you can see why the effect of feeling like you are in the movie with them creates tension and many other emotions which contribute to the fear factor i appreciated how the witch was never shown and how in fact nothing was really shown that could be deemed as particularly frightening the ability to create fear through sound and the reactions of the characters in the film is some feat and needs to be commended what i personally took away from the film was the memory of the fear and complete isolation desperation and absence of hope experienced by the characters something which appeals eerily to the human fear of being trapped possibly the most memorable part of the film    this film is very effective and very entertaining and i would go as far as to say realistic even in the vague blanket sense of the term i did find it frightening but in a different way that i find relatively incomparable to any other horror i have watched  watch this film watch it now
Nov 21 2007,positive,was good when it first came out due to the whole is it real or not publicity
Nov 21 2007,negative,wast of my time and money
Nov 21 2007,positive,very good the second time not as scary as expected though
Nov 21 2007,negative,i didnt understand this it was a cheaply shot movie with snot hooray
Nov 21 2007,negative,this is awful  i didnt get it in high school  i hated it when i saw it a second time  im huge on independent film  this is using a camcorder  not the same thing  and its never been remotely scary just dumb
Nov 21 2007,positive,the camerawork and dragging plot are fair criticisms and it is more of an experiment than a movie but this still manages to create a spooky atmosphere simply through darkness the performances and wellused sound effects
Nov 21 2007,positive,started of slow and boring but the final scene was awesome good  horror film because u never see the villian
Nov 21 2007,positive,i cant believe so many people got confused and thought this was an actual documentary how retarded do you have to be to think that
Nov 20 2007,negative,one of the worst movies i seen
Nov 20 2007,negative,garbage anybody who was scared watching this movie needs to have their heads examined saw it at the movie theatre junk as far as i am concernedlol
Nov 20 2007,positive,this was actually quite effective when i first saw it the people in it are idiots though
Nov 20 2007,positive,i thought this movie was kind of bogusuntil later that night when it crept into my brain and made me sleep with the lights on not as effective on repeat viewings but still kinda creepy
Nov 20 2007,positive,i believe this is true
Nov 20 2007,negative,not what it was cracked up to be
Nov 20 2007,positive,pretty boring until the last half hour then it gets seriously creepy would have loved to see it when it first came out

Nov 20 2007,positive,the best horror movie ever made
Nov 20 2007,positive,i found it interesting and fascinating  love it
Nov 20 2007,positive,scared the piss out of me when i first saw it not because i thought it was real but because i lived in the woods that alone makes the movie a completely different experience
Nov 20 2007,negative,it only goes as low as 0
Nov 20 2007,negative,it sucks and brendan it actually cost 5 bucks
Nov 20 2007,negative,this movie was a waste of time and the fbomb was used way too much i eventually had to watch the film on mute only returning the volume when i thought there might be important dialogue which was pretty rare   over all this movie was just crap and with actors who were a lot less creative with their words than most angry rednecks
Nov 20 2007,positive,was actually scared good job i hated all the characters
Nov 20 2007,neutral,what was so scary about this movie i just got bored

Nov 19 2007,positive,do not watch this under the influence of drugsdont do it
Nov 19 2007,negative,the movie pretty much blows all the way thru till the very endi kinda dug the last 3 minutes
Nov 19 2007,positive,simple brilliant suspensefulmore shocks from a camera movement and a little sound design than every friday the 13th film combined genius marketing campaign pitching it as a documentary

Nov 18 2007,neutral,if the rest of the movie was like the last 5 mins this would be the alltime scariest movie ever made
Nov 18 2007,positive,possibly the scariest movie i have ever seen the last five minutes will make you shit your pants and the performances are great because the directos kept the actors living in the woods with little food water sleep and no idea where the script would go next
Nov 18 2007,positive,scary and believable
Nov 18 2007,positive,i saw this three years ago and was scared out of my mind i saw it last night and was mostly bored but its a suspense film not a horrorfest i would recommend it to anyone who could go in blind

Nov 16 2007,positive,simple ideas are often the best ones to be watched alone and late in the night

Nov 13 2007,negative,a touch of brilliance to make and promote the cheapest and most financially successful film ever made even though it still is one of the worst    quote  no it will not get nominated as the turkey of the year award as turkey movies are usually enjoyable   george miller  director
Nov 13 2007,positive,unbelieveably scarey if you watch it before it opens to the public and everyone still thinks its real

Nov 13 2007,positive,artistically great  lacking a little in the entertainment
Nov 13 2007,positive,i love the ending d
Nov 13 2007,negative,a very overrated flick about 3 kids getting lost in the woods and being unable to find their way out  and it was suppose to be real yeah right i would hope normal ppl would not be this stupid
Nov 13 2007,negative,what a complete waste of an hour of my life
Nov 13 2007,positive,the sheer impact blair witch had upon its release was amazing even more so if you consdier the production and then the actual content of the movie  i take bwp not as a horror but as a study of how 3 teen documentary makers react to being lost in a woods good performances from the 3 leads   itake the tent russleing and bnoises as secondary and even as false subconciousnss due to the situation
Nov 13 2007,negative,what a horrible movie
Nov 13 2007,positive,i just recently watched this movie again and i gotta say this movie deserves more respect than i previously thought while 85 of the movie is cussing and trees it really has some frightening elements to it and the whole thing is very believable i dont think its one of the greatest movies ever but i do think this movie deserves another watching to truly appreciate it
Nov 13 2007,positive,i am not sure it was scary but it certainly is unique  i felt a bit nauseous during the film and only later attributed it to the shaky camera work i am not sure it would work nearly as well on a repeat viewing
Nov 13 2007,positive,after all the parodies and nauseating sequel still a ride of terror done so originally its unforgotten
Nov 13 2007,positive,the effect  5 the film quality  2if you were one of those who believed the rumours that it was real then it shit you up good time cant be watched again though

Nov 12 2007,positive,being lost in the woods was the thing that kept me on the edge of my seat  loses appeal the second time around
Nov 12 2007,positive,3 stars but it sucked think about it when the movie came out people were shitting their pants its low budget gave it the eerie 1st person view so creepy that people believed it was in fact a documentry  i enjoyed watching it with friends
Nov 12 2007,negative,need to fetch barfbag
Nov 12 2007,negative,i felt nauseated just looking through the shaky lens
Nov 12 2007,negative,hahahahahahaha  i actually watched this entire movie  i thought it was a true story until i researched it afterwards so it freaked me out a bit but basically it was lame  just kind ofbad
Nov 11 2007,neutral,the end really effn creeps me out
Nov 11 2007,positive,hate on it now but it will go down as a movie that changed movies ad it scared hell from me when i saw it
Nov 11 2007,negative,this movie came out around the same time as the sixth sense i remember wishing id watched that movie a second time after seeing this in the theater in one scene the girl is being patronized by the hippielooking guy with a camera in her face why do you keep filming he asks to which she replies because its all i have the director probably told her this was her motivation but didnt want her to actually say that verbatim on screen kind of shitty one star for the premise fun fact that girl used to be in steak n shake commercials
Nov 11 2007,negative,this made me motion sick when i first saw it  overrated
Nov 11 2007,negative,uh not scary at all
Nov 11 2007,negative,dudethis is the reason why movies have budgets

Nov 11 2007,neutral,shaky camera work much like the plot  i wasnt convinced
Nov 11 2007,positive,my friends were in the adjacent room and i still couldnt watch without flipping the channels i was lucky to come back just before the finale superb direction
Nov 11 2007,positive,though the camcorder technique really dates this film its still got a great narrative structure and relies on not one special effect to create its genuinely scary atmosphere frightening
Nov 11 2007,neutral,good the first time although not deserving of the self hype and media accolades it received
Nov 11 2007,positive,besides the fakeness of it it was really well put together
Nov 11 2007,positive,so creepy so creative
Nov 11 2007,positive,i didnt know anything about this film when i went to the cinema but i got it into my head that the footage was real so because i thought it was real i got stuck into it the film scared me more than any horror has ever done and ive seen alot of horror films it did its job then but now i know better it doesnt do anything for me im glad i seen it for the first time believing it real
Nov 11 2007,positive,fucking intense with spoton realistic acting quite possibly the scariest movie ever made
Nov 11 2007,negative,when you have to read a disclaimer about motions sickness time to by a steadycam and forget about the ambiance of the picture
Nov 11 2007,positive,the end was creepy the rest not so much
Nov 11 2007,negative,so sorry i ever saw this onetalk about waisting ur time
Nov 11 2007,positive,if you alow it to the blair witch project will take you on an emotional journey that you may never have experienced before this is not a film for the cinema but one for watching alone in a dark room with nothing but the glow of the tv for company preferably watch the dvd with the curse of the blair witch documentary first to give you a feel of the characters and what they were doing then watch it again with the commentary to realise just how brilliant the directors were at bringing three fantastic performances from the cast heather donahue is awesome as the head strong leader of our motley crew not beign afraid to cry scream and look very dirty on camera scary funny and brought horror back to the masses fantastic
Nov 10 2007,positive,terrifyingive only been able to watch it twiceboth times i was scared
Nov 10 2007,positive,youll either love it or hate it i loved it
Nov 10 2007,neutral,theres no doubt this movie opened a new genre of horror films which i can respect but to be honest i expected the ending to be much more scary it played out like a nightmare but not one that would remember in the morning
Nov 10 2007,negative,scared the shit out of me in the 8th gradei hate it

Nov 10 2007,negative,ugh this movie made me so sick to my stomach and it was lame
Nov 10 2007,positive,for what it was at the time of its release it was quite frightening but loses its appeal once you do your research

Nov 9 2007,positive,this is not really a movie this is just an experiment give it a try because is a nice experiment 
Nov 9 2007,positive,i remember watching this at an early screening and i liked it at the time it had a very real feel to it because a lot of it was improvd and the actorsactress shot most of the footage and all the fake information on the web made the film interesting unfortunately a novelty can only make a film better then it is for a short time still id like to see more independent horror films turn out this good
Nov 9 2007,positive,the best scary movie i have ever seen
Nov 9 2007,negative,i went to see this in the theatre when it came out  i still want my money back

Nov 9 2007,negative,this movie was terrible
Nov 9 2007,positive,hitchcock taken to his ultimate conclusion via ridley scott not a bad film school project didnt quite scare as many people out of the woods as jaws did out of the water but you have to give people who were essentially amateurs kudos for something that creeps you right the fuck out and can sic a host of nightmares on you
Nov 9 2007,positive,one of my favorite horror movies  a must
Nov 8 2007,negative,a complete ripoff of the great grindhouse epic cannibal halocaust
Nov 8 2007,negative,waste of time and film
Nov 8 2007,positive,i dunno i thought this was alright
Nov 8 2007,neutral,nice gimmick bad longevity
Nov 8 2007,positive,motion sickness did not help with this movie
Nov 8 2007,positive,great idea too much hype
Nov 8 2007,positive,only saw it once in a theatre which i think is a good rule of thumb for this one
Nov 8 2007,positive,one of my favorite horror movies because of its originality
Nov 8 2007,negative,this aberration of a horror movie just goes to show what happens when no critic has the courage to tell film students when their movie totally sucks i got sick to my stomach watching this because they put the action camera on super krazee swivel mode during the whole movie if you are scared of sticks being thrown at a tent then yes this movie will scare you if you have ever given a child a camera and told him or her to run around in the backyard for a bit then you pretty much have a idea of the feel of this movie
Nov 8 2007,negative,the first time i saw it i thought it was very creative and very disturbing  but when i saw it a second time it just seemed kinda lame
Nov 8 2007,positive,okay so i was one of those people who saw it in the theatre and had to drive home through the backroads from syracuse to oneida and i was really scared  so yeah i liked it
Nov 8 2007,negative,i went hiking in burkettsville md right before this movie came out  we were in 6th grade and all freaking out beautiful place though
Nov 8 2007,positive,good experiment in filmmaking and i did get really creeped out watching it in the theater
Nov 8 2007,positive,hell yeah this movie scared the shit outta me and it still does lol
Nov 8 2007,negative,dumb movie  i wanted to jump off the varazzno bridge when i herd they were making another 1
Nov 8 2007,positive,more chilling or unsettling than terrifyingly scary this movie is very original and i really respect and like the diy element of it its a cool story with a very real portrayal of fear and i would highly recommend seeing it dont expect a horrific bloodbath though more like a subtle scratch
Nov 8 2007,negative,kasittamatonta hypea metsassa kavelysta turha    boring walk in the woods movie how can one be so scared of trees and stuff
Nov 8 2007,positive,the media may have tarnished the impact this movie had on a lot of people looking back i can say the idea was a genius one probably the most successful independent movie ever the blair witch project took everybodys common fear of getting lost in the woods and fully exapnded it watching this again recently it still got under my skin i loved the fact that they put us in the protagonists shoes by shooting only with a 16 mm and a camcorder that made it very realisitc for me the shaking of the camera never turned me off like ti did most people either it actually made me try to study it even more and figure out what i was seeing the fact that most home movies are like that added to the realism of it it never showed too much of anything and made it creepier for me not knowing what was lurking outside the tent or what was deep in the woods i cant really comment on daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez directing style since they never actually shot it but you can tell they were full on in making it seem real they would give the actors their basic plot of the day then manipulate them by leaving the items they find or making the noises theyd hear at night they did an excellent job speaking of which all three of the main actors were extremely likeable and believable thus making it all the more frightening for me heather donahue probably went through every emotion a human can go through in one shoot and did it all very convincingly michael williams was my favorite in this and had me laughing on many occasions he reminded me of myself in that type of scenario joshua leonard is very cool and kept reminding the others and myself i need a life to remain calm and try to get the hell out of dodge there are a couple of parts where it took me out of the movie for a small amount of time i didnt really think that the students the guys primarily would be filming during some of the creepier parts the tent and the house being the main two on top of that the fact that they had that much film stock and battery power for over a weeks worth of footage was a little too convenient but thats me being picky again ten years after this has come out im glad i can say that this is an inventive involving and extremely creepy movie watch it in the dark with a small setting and get warped into the blair witch hunt
Nov 7 2007,neutral,can you say motion sickness
Nov 7 2007,neutral,saw it after all the hype so unfortunately it didnt hold as much power once we finally saw it  still for such a low budget it was pretty well done and i can see how it might have been great going into it blind
Nov 7 2007,negative,you dont ever even get to see what the witch looks like  this movie blows
Nov 7 2007,positive,for some reason this movie scared the pants off me  hairs stand up on my neck just thinking about it but most people are soso on it
Nov 7 2007,negative,this movie wasdumb
Nov 7 2007,positive,still wont ever go camping in maine
Nov 7 2007,negative,hahahaha what a good laughyet well stupidly scary enough when you walk home through the woods
Nov 7 2007,positive,may 2009 nearly 10 years after its released and i finally see it it was a good film what made it scary was imaging myself in the middle of the woods at night very creepy and hearing noises but cant see them even creepier i can see why it was hyped up as a good scary film 
Nov 7 2007,negative,i dont really know abou this one
Nov 7 2007,negative,the only word they say in this movie is fuck and omg
Nov 7 2007,positive,watch it for the last 10 minutes thats when its actually scary
Nov 7 2007,neutral,i just didnt get it  i probably need to watch it again
Nov 7 2007,positive,i was a little disappointed but in the case of originality wow
Nov 7 2007,neutral,i was quite literally one herkyjerky camera movement away from doing the technicolor yawn all over the person in front of me at the theater where i saw this
Nov 7 2007,negative,pointless just running around screaming and crying nothing more
Nov 7 2007,negative,this was suppose to be scary
Nov 7 2007,positive,this is a movie that always gets my blodd moving bc i believe in that it really happenedlove it
Nov 7 2007,positive,did what it attempted to do almost flawlessly i cant see myself ever watching it again and really being into it though deserves credit for its unique properties
Nov 7 2007,negative,ok seriously this movie was literally a blur and not in a good way i usually get really freaked out by supernatural movies but the horrible camera work and bad plot just made this movie almost comical
Nov 7 2007,positive,horrendously overrated not that scary but worth a watch
Nov 7 2007,negative,quite overrated and often unwatchable shaky camera work can be a good thing but not with this film basically take a camcorder run around like a maniac and scream and swear for 90 minutes and you can pretty much duplicate this film c
Nov 7 2007,positive,i love the blair witch project the concept behind this film was amazing and the fact that people get confused about its authenticity makes it so much more scary great horror film
Nov 7 2007,positive,only cause i thought it was real the first time and it scared me shitless
Nov 7 2007,negative,isnt that meant to have been fake
Nov 7 2007,neutral,i fell asleep near the end and no longer cared what happened to the idiots in the woods
Nov 7 2007,positive,oh gosh this movie is so raw i was practically asking myself whether its all real or just a made up the children sound the lighting the voices and the dialogues they all creep me out now whenever i enter a jungle i will make sure no one bring a camcorder well just in case
Nov 7 2007,positive,just thinking about it gives me the chill for like 2 weeks i had to sleep with lights on and not look at the corners
Nov 6 2007,positive,left me freaked out for a week  i actually honestly cancelled a camping trip because of it  my friend jay thought it was real  damn
Nov 6 2007,neutral,wheres the map  i kicked it in the fucking river
Nov 6 2007,positive,you can only watch this movie onceafter that it just doesnt have the same effectit scares you to deathvery realistic
Nov 6 2007,negative,good when i was 13now stupid
Nov 6 2007,positive,this scared the everlasting piss out of 11yearold trish we also have this to thank for reality tv
Nov 6 2007,negative,why was this a cult hit exactly
Nov 6 2007,positive,not that scary personally i think the ending could have been much better written nevertheless i would not like to be camping in the place of the kids
Nov 6 2007,positive,clearly a case of the ingenuity of the promotion campaign attracting the wrong sorts of audience regardless a wonderfully blank hostile piece of work stupifying wellacted
Nov 6 2007,positive,surprisingly goodgave me goose bumps when i first saw it  alone in the dark  naturally
Nov 6 2007,neutral,if only the whole film had been as frightening as the last 10 minutes this could have been a great film  but instead were treated to 30 minutes of boring documentarycharacterization stuff 30 minutes of boring wandering around lost 20 minutes of yelling and drama and only 10 minutes of actual scares
Nov 6 2007,positive,yes i was one of the ones who liked it and thought it was very scary
Nov 6 2007,positive,i thought it was okay
Nov 6 2007,positive,there is so much nuance in the blair witch project that it blows my mind even though its not particularly scary
Nov 6 2007,negative,made me jump once perhaps seemed like a good idea  the time
Nov 6 2007,positive,this got a rough ride for what was then an original concept
Nov 6 2007,negative,overrated horseshit

Nov 5 2007,positive,first film that really scared me
Nov 5 2007,positive,awesome so scary first movie and only movie to actually scare me
Nov 5 2007,negative,i saw this in theaters when it came out  it wasnt scary then  somewhat funny because of the hype
Nov 5 2007,negative,i remember watching americans freak out at noises we canadians could clearly identify as non threatening not scary at all plus the camera work gave me a headache
Nov 5 2007,negative,hated it and wanted my money back  all the hype was better than the actual movie  by the end i wanted the witch to catch everyone
Nov 5 2007,positive,great flick it scared the dirt outta me  i saw it in the theater and was very impressed you should watch it if youre into being scared

Nov 4 2007,negative,didnt really like it was overhyped
Nov 4 2007,positive,really really scary not your typical scary movie
Nov 4 2007,negative,this is a love it or hate it movie and i hated it
Nov 4 2007,negative,the only scary part of the blair bitch project was the ending
Nov 4 2007,negative,perhaps the greatest scam ever perpetrated by the film industry ever with no plot very little acting or sense apparently no script to work with and with worse camera work then you could see in most you tube home made videos this movie pulled the public into the theaters in droves worse yet people in what can only be assumed is an attempt not to appear foolish started proclaiming to anyone that would listen that it was scary and good the emperors new clothes law of scam artistry at work if you want further examples of this kind of sheep mentality check out the world of high art  only one positive came out of the whole thing my sister made me go to this on my birthday even though i didnt want to and the camera work made her so nauseous she had to leave the theater how is that for instant karma  just kidding love you sis
Nov 4 2007,positive,starring heather donahue michael willimas and joshua leonard      the characters are three young filmakers who set out in maryland to find out about the mystery behind the ledgend of the blair witch they each have different veiws on the whole thing one thinks its real one thinks its a hoax and one is just there to film they are very joking and laid back pretty much the whole first half    the second half weird things begin to happen creepy symbolic figures such as a pile of rocks which were used by the indians as a sort of tombstone appear in the middle of the night right outside of their tent each night something strange happens one night they hear what sounds like people walking through the woods but looking around thy find no one another night they hear something like children laughing and playing but again they see nothing when looking around the last ten minutes are pretty intense and leave you with the ultimate what the hell just happened moment where you know what happens but its just so intense      the film was shot using a handheld camera it was shakey the whole movie which gave it the effect of reality some people do not like this and therefor hate the movie i personaly love this kind of camera movement it makes films seem more real     there is no music in the entire film exept for the titles and the credits which makes it even creepier
Nov 4 2007,positive,this movie is cool it shows hardship between the three friends in the woods and how the witch tore them apart
Nov 4 2007,positive,it had its moments too bad its fake
Nov 4 2007,negative,it gets a half star for successfully duping everyoneif only just for a little while
Nov 4 2007,negative,an interesting way to shoot a movie it seemed like this was acually shot by 3 collage kids the movie is not scary as much as it is suspenseful gets kinda boring at times on a side note if this ever happened to anyone in real life it would be scary as hell
Nov 4 2007,positive,scared the hell out of me the first time
Nov 4 2007,negative,predictable horror crap
Nov 4 2007,positive,this actually handled itself very decently im constantly shocked by people who dont seem to understand the concept of experimental film formats who hated it
Nov 3 2007,neutral,creeped me out seriously im never seeing this movie again
Nov 3 2007,positive,despite the cheese this was one of the only horror films that scared me  perhaps because i found it actually believable  the offcamera shit was the scariest though the ending wasnt really all that scary
Nov 3 2007,negative,i bought this before i saw it big mistake
Nov 3 2007,positive,it was kinda creepy not as horrific as it was made out to be but it packed some noteable ammo
Nov 3 2007,positive,spooky the first time you see it  watch it a second time and youll nod off  its all in the suspense  unless of course you were actually frightened by 42 minutes of blurry indistinct images  if that is indeed the case you may be retarded and should seek a lifetime of doting care and not be allowed to use any other implement beyond a large harmless plastic spoon
Nov 3 2007,positive,i will never take hikes because of this movie
Nov 3 2007,positive,alreet something original
Nov 3 2007,positive,this is all i can think of when i go camping now
Nov 3 2007,negative,omg stick people lol this movie is lame but amusing back when i was 7
Nov 3 2007,positive,this one was interesting to say the least just watch it its hard to make an opinion on
Nov 3 2007,positive,i thought this was a true story the first time that i saw itbefore they came out with it being a hoax so it really scared me
Nov 3 2007,positive,its what you dont see that scares you the most
Nov 3 2007,neutral,was this not a stupid movie or what
Nov 3 2007,positive,i used my imagination and then this movie is very scary  a lot of people knock it
Nov 3 2007,positive,extremely well done and scary as hell despite practically no special effects pulls off the documentary style with fantastic realism if like me you dislike conflict the mounting tension between the protagonists as they crack under the pressure of being lost in the woods will be enough to get your heart rate up
Nov 3 2007,positive,after watching it a couple times and in the dark i got a little scared especially the ending
Nov 3 2007,positive,a veary strange movie with alot of mystery with a twist of alford hitchcock presents or twilite zone
Nov 3 2007,negative,remember guys wot ma pile of steaming poo
Nov 3 2007,positive,one of the few truly truly disturbing movies id recommend not watching
Nov 3 2007,negative,awful horrible movie though i do have to give them credit for having such a low budget film build such a hype that takes some work still sucky movie that i will never watch again
Nov 3 2007,negative,i dont know what the hype around this movie wasnot scary at all
Nov 3 2007,positive,one of the scariest horror movies ive ever seen because the film allows the viewer to imagine what could be lurking in those woods and what could be scarier than our own imaginations
Nov 3 2007,neutral,pretty interestin  tru 1
Nov 3 2007,positive,low budget ground breaking mayhem
Nov 3 2007,positive,really scary must watch 
Nov 3 2007,positive,omfg    ce ma speriat filmu asta     uffdar na pacat k sa terminat asa
Nov 2 2007,positive,psychological horror thats very nice
Nov 2 2007,negative,the only movie were i cried at the end and not because the story was sad
Nov 2 2007,positive,as fake as it is its still scary as hell great concept it still sends shivers up me just thinking about this film
Nov 2 2007,positive,one of the scariest movies ive ever seen it plays with your mind by keeping you in the dark literally and forcing you to use your other senses besides sight what you can only imagine is always more terrifying than what is actually there
Nov 2 2007,positive,pretty good for what it is
Nov 2 2007,positive,this movie gets trashed a lot  heres my defense of it original thinking for the plot of this documentary  a lot of suspense and intrigue of whatll happen  also great acting in that it really really looked like how any of us would react and talk in such circumstances the one guy losing the map while theyre lost for example  plus the ending was terrific for a horror film anyway  so there
Nov 2 2007,negative,oh my god sweat i think i think they just showed gulp a movie in here
Nov 2 2007,positive,one of the scariest movies that me and my friend have seen
Nov 2 2007,negative,how has a class action law suit not been filed to refund the price of a ticket to this movie
Nov 2 2007,positive,this was a great flick to see on opening night and having heard nothing about it before
Nov 2 2007,positive,terrifying low budget shocker that in its day earned a little more than 15 minutes of fame
Nov 2 2007,negative,not really a big fan of this one i like endings this one kinda didnt have one
Nov 2 2007,positive,i never saw this when it came out so i went in knowing the ending and the ploy behind it  even so it was pretty chilling
Nov 2 2007,positive,i watched this film once  never again no blood the film just messes with your mind simply brilliant
Nov 2 2007,positive,30000 low budget film  shot in 8 days  no name actors  no script  this movie is amazing because of what it did to people at the time it came out and still to people that see it for the first time today this movie was marketed over the internet more than anything and for 2 guys to make this movie about 3 people in the woods making a documentary and have it make over 350 million dollarsthats a fucking good movie    55
Nov 2 2007,positive,it only works once but man did this movie scare the pants off me
Nov 2 2007,positive,cannibal holocaust did it first the blair witch project did it better alright lets get the bad out of the way first  above all else this film is  contrived  seven piles of rocks in the woods  i kicked the map into the river  there are some really blatant plot devices in here and while the actors are competent they dont pull it off with the spontaneity that is necessary  these moments help pull the movie down along with bits of acting that arent quite up to par  the jumpy cam bothers some people pussies but its an integral part of the fucking movie  all in all this is a scary scary movie  there are some parts that will chill you to the bones and like jaws it plays on a fear that everyone already sort of has in the back of their mind what if something happens to me while im camping  the supernatural elements always off camera are handled just right so that we feel the presence but not the cheese and the ending is brilliant  filmmaking this bold only comes along every once in a while and i think thats why the blair witch got so big  its a scary scary movie
Nov 2 2007,positive,this movie was scary and funny at the same time lol especially the tent scene argh
Nov 1 2007,positive,it only works the first time you see it but that first time is pretty good
Nov 1 2007,positive,without trying to sound tough id like to throw out there that i dont get scared in movies often    this movie made me almost pee my pants  and the genius of the whole thing is that i knew it was fake and i never saw anything gory or disgusting on screen    but it made me believe it was all too real  this film is genius in the way that it puts you in the forest with its characters and lets your imagination take over  proving that imagination is nearly always more vivid and creepy than anything shown onscreen    a great movie to watch on halloween and it stands alone as a great horror  simplistic yet fantastic
Nov 1 2007,positive,creepy and insulting and yet masterful in relying upon the viewers imagination
Nov 1 2007,positive,pretty creepy in parts i liked it dont bother with the sequelreally
Nov 1 2007,positive,this movie messed me up its always interesting seeing the polarizing effect this movie has on the viewers either they absolutely hate it or they absolutely love it what i always find amazing is when people complain that it wasnt real who the heck would want these events to actually be real it was scary enough watching this knowing that it wasnt i cant imagine what id do if this was actual footage if youre the kind of person who can suspend their disbelief and really get sucked into a movie you will love this one as much as anyone can love to be scared out of their wits this was the scariest movie ive ever seen not because of what it showed but what it didnt show because when it comes down to it its the unknown thats the scariest of all and this movie taps into that primal fear like no other movie ive ever watched
Nov 1 2007,positive,i rewatched this film tonight having not seen it for for over 5 years the hype around this film was crazy away from all the madness its actually just a plain old scary film given the way horro has gone recently the bloddier the better this film really stands out against the slashertorture films of the last decade i recommend it to anyone with an open mind
Nov 1 2007,positive,blew my mind frankly found it utterly convincing i can actually understand how some people got  fooled the acting is superb
Nov 1 2007,positive,too bad this was fake ha
Nov 1 2007,negative,the camera angles made me sick so i had to leave in the middle
Nov 1 2007,negative,awful movie its probably better that they were never found
Nov 1 2007,positive,lol i like this movie
Nov 1 2007,negative,oh geez this was such a big deal when i was in middle school everyone wanted to see it and it cucked can i get it no stars
Nov 1 2007,positive,it is still staggeringly original very few films in the horror genre can keep your attention while showing very little on screen the acting was superb making the horror more real i recommend it to anyone who tired of todays torture porn horror
Nov 1 2007,negative,dumbest thing ive ever seen
Nov 1 2007,neutral,i like the style but it wasnt scary just a bit creepy
Nov 1 2007,positive,i understand why many didnt enjoy this but i liked seeing it the one time in the theater
Nov 1 2007,negative,this movie was creative and i liked the concept of having it seem homemade but ultimately i did not find it scary which is what the main purpose of the movie is there is too much footage of just the three kids arguing and cussing at each other and very little actual scenes of danger and even those scenes arent too scary cause you dont even see anything the ending is cool but overall this movie wasnt the greatest
Nov 1 2007,positive,i really liked this movie the mockumentary on vh1 was a great touch
Nov 1 2007,positive,great idea for a horror film was genuinely creepy if you forget the fact that it isnt actually real footage  some people have criticised the ending but it just adds to the reality of the situation  theres not meant to be any kind of explanation
Oct 31 2007,positive,scared the hell out of me mainly cause i was convinced that the movie was based on a true story pretty great movie though
Oct 31 2007,positive,it was interesting suspenseful but full of swearing kind of sad to find it was all fake
Oct 31 2007,positive,when it first came out it was scary
Oct 31 2007,positive,come on this was cool when i watched it back when i was 11
Oct 31 2007,negative,horrible movie not scary in the least bit
Oct 31 2007,negative,um i dont really like the acting
Oct 31 2007,positive,this was the only horror  movie i have seen that actually gave me nightmares the same night i saw it evn my favorite exorsist didnt manage to do that   it is supper creepyof course i will never go in the woods even when it only starts to get darkbrrrrr
Oct 31 2007,positive,good for a younger crowd to intensify their spiritual beliefsnice scare
Oct 31 2007,positive,it wasnt low budget its that it was really made by those kids at which it does suck to be them but it wasnt boring it was suspensful for the whole time
Oct 31 2007,positive,was a good movie at the time it came outas it was a bit original in the not knowing the reality of the movie but once you knew it was a fake it was all over good idea at first
Oct 31 2007,negative,the last five minutes interested me
Oct 31 2007,negative,horrible nuff said
Oct 31 2007,positive,blair witch project is one of a few horror flicks that genuinely scared me the scares and style are so uniquethis is a mustsee film for halloween
Oct 31 2007,positive,interesting premise for a lowbudget indie about three film students who get lost in the woods and are attacked by a witch too bad they improvised the dialogue which was horribly boring and pointlessly profane
Oct 31 2007,positive,this movie was pretty freaky it just goes to show that you dont need a big budget to make a really creepy movie
Oct 31 2007,negative,maybe i just didnt get it  maybe it just sucked balls
Oct 31 2007,negative,about as scary as a fluffy chick
Oct 31 2007,positive,cant make up my mind about this either way  i dont hate it i dont love itits just wellumdunno  worth watching tho will watch again
Oct 31 2007,negative,i give it two stars because at moments if you use your imagination it can be eerie otherwise its a fairly dull overhyped film
Oct 30 2007,negative,i saw it too late it was ruined by the hype
Oct 30 2007,positive,very good premise and full use of a broad spectrum of emotions including genuine terror  i had to look at the dvd case again to make sure it was a scripted film  i couldnt believe that these kids could emulate such convincing acts  huge props

Oct 30 2007,negative,thought it was stupid  wasnt even scarytotal waste
Oct 30 2007,negative,clearly none of these kids grew up near woods or they wouldnt have been scared of every little sound
Oct 30 2007,negative,the compass was obviously broken follow the frickin river you idiots im still mad about this movie
Oct 30 2007,negative,cult phenom its so 1999
Oct 30 2007,positive,great premise great setup  it had been years since a movie made me tense up like this since the exorcist really
Oct 30 2007,negative,maybe its because im a skeptic maybe at the time of viewing it the film style bothered me whatever it may have been this film didnt scare me in fact it bored me and up until i saw recent films my country made the mistake of greenlighting somersault 237 the nugget the book of revelation this was the worst film i had ever seen    for me the biggest problem has to do with the people we see on screen in a horror movie even a documentary you would expect on some level we can emphasize with our leads or failing that we can enjoy watching them be tormented well wrong on both counts i dont think anything they do is particularly smart someone tell me why you would kick your map into a river dont tell me out of frustration thats not good enough you cant use the argument of its all scripted on me either that means they were scripted to be idiots that makes it even worse because youre trying to come across as a documentary not a cliche horror film but then what should i expect from a bunch of kids wandering out searching for an urban legend with no good reason little tip unless you have a great dane and a van with the words mystery machine written on it or are the two leads from supernatural dont tempt fate    the best review i have ever heard of this movie comes from fictional family guy character brian griffin nothings happening nothings happening nothings happening its over a lot of people look pissed well said brian id normally close with something of my own but thats a better description than id want to give it
Oct 30 2007,positive,hey i was creeped out
Oct 30 2007,negative,ugh watching this movie made me naseous barf
Oct 30 2007,positive,genuinely scary with hidden images actual tension and a creepiness throughout that would be touch to match
Oct 30 2007,positive,the reason for the high rating is because of the impact that this film had on pop culture
Oct 30 2007,neutral,heard this was terrifying watched it at 3am alone after everyone was asleep not scary
Oct 30 2007,positive,good low budget film
Oct 29 2007,negative,you mean the ball went over the fence  
Oct 29 2007,positive,love it the slow buildup the frustration the jumpy handheld camerawork the awfully creepy crazy ending good stuff
Oct 29 2007,negative,the first movie completely hyped on the internet unfortunately it wasnt worth the hype
Oct 29 2007,positive,im not afraid to admit the movie gave me goosebumps and had me ready to jump out of my skin
Oct 29 2007,positive,someone had to explain to me that this was fake and that they were all still alivei feel stupid but i like the movie
Oct 29 2007,negative,dumbest most low budget movie ever made
Oct 29 2007,positive,dont care what anyone says this movie scared the snot out of me
Oct 29 2007,negative,this movie caused me alot of pain  firstly i watched the movie thinking it was all true and it totally freaked me out  then i found out it was all an act  it made me feel like an idiot  so first i lost precious nights of sleep being freaked then itmade me question my intelligence  not worth the stress  it was well made and beleivable though  i will give it that
Oct 29 2007,negative,made me seasick nauseous is the same thing is scared
Oct 29 2007,neutral,when the film came out it was ok  now its just a big joke
Oct 29 2007,positive,a brave project indeed they fooled many people that i know
Oct 29 2007,positive,the only thing i actually liked about this was the ending and thats just because it was kind of creepy
Oct 29 2007,positive,scarywondering if its real but i am not going to find out
Oct 29 2007,positive,ok did freak me out a bit when i watched it when i was about 15 or something
Oct 29 2007,positive,the marketing was damned brilliant
Oct 29 2007,negative,not scary and made my head hurt
Oct 29 2007,negative,i think this has to rank as one of the alltime worst films ive ever seen  i actually feel asleep in the theater  i wish i had demanded my money and 2 hours back
Oct 29 2007,positive,scared the sht out of me dont ask
Oct 29 2007,negative,i was too chicken to watch this
Oct 29 2007,positive,the ending scared the living piss out of me
Oct 29 2007,negative,brave attempt but didnt do it for me
Oct 29 2007,negative,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and it is praised for its originality well the originality is simply using your homecamera and do a movie without a budget this movie is crap it could have easily been a masterpiece    this movie is basically about 3 amateurs taking their camera out in the forest maybe they were more i dont care anyway the more they walk around they realize they are walking in the same place over and over no matter where they go so scary sigh    another problem with this movie is that the makers are so uncreative they survive on you making up the plot what do you think happens why do you think they are getting lost  that is sooooo brilliant my a makes more creative sounds than this movie do    do i even need to say how bad the camera work is  obviously the shaky camera is the originality of this movie and really that is all it has to offer    you decide if you get scared you make up the ending you decide to watch this crap you decide if you want to turn it off unfortunately i saw it until the end and no answers were given it just shows how uncreative you can be and how untalented you are in moviemaking that you make a movie that dosent make any sense and people will love it i honestly thought the ending would be worth it my imagination started to get tickled after watching this awful stinking pile of st for almost 2 hours but then it just ends  there is no ending there is no explanation that is so dumb    i mean almost half of the whole movie is these people swearing and getting angry and just talking there is nothing scary about this movie     we have created a masterpiece we have no plot no acting no good camera work no good anything but now we will cash in because we are so creative yippie
Oct 29 2007,positive,very scary when it first came outstill like the desperation of it when they are lost
Oct 29 2007,negative,i spent most of the time being confused because i didnt know what was going on
Oct 29 2007,positive,okay the movie was stupid in the ending because it was edited but still this movie was frightening and funny i enjoyed watching this movie
Oct 29 2007,positive,i liked this movie at the time it came out  but not so much now especially since they revealed the hoax
Oct 28 2007,positive,it was  a cool concept but i didnt really get into it
Oct 28 2007,positive,with the right mindset it was pretty good  not really worth a second viewing
Oct 28 2007,positive,i could sleep for ages because my aunt told me it was real
Oct 28 2007,positive,even though this has been proven to be fake i must say that the element of it is certainly very real and i was so impressed with the improvisation and the way the film turned out considering it only had a budget of 35k  didnt scare me but putting myself into heather joshua and mikes position i couldnt help but leave with that eerie feeling that keeps people awake at night
Oct 28 2007,negative,the most overhyped movie ever  it wasnt even scary just stupid
Oct 28 2007,negative,first time it was good second time stupid
Oct 28 2007,positive,i thought this was real  the way they did this with the budget they had just goes to prove that you dont need millions in special effects to put the audience on the edge of their seat
Oct 28 2007,positive,it seems like whenever i review one movie just one movie i am compelled to review a hundred more      with my seventeenth birthday coming up in a handful of months ill be able to see a wider range of movies i can legally get myself into r rated movies at the theaters and my parents will allow me to see a few movies ive been wanting to seeat least thats how its supposed to happen to be honest i might as well just be seventeen right now my parents are already easing their chokehold on what movies i can and cant see every time they turn around im watching another violent movie theyve become so used to me seeing violence in movies that it scarcely bothers them anymore if a movie is rated r for violence theyll let me watch it because ive probably seen worse anyhow drugs are a nonfactor because i know better than to drink or smoke at this age or any age really language is a bit of a sore spot but theyre willing to make exceptions for certain movies such as the one this review is about sexwell that is indeed the final frontier i think if im allowed to see three of the four things that up a movies rating i might as well just be allowed to see the last one but my parents are still a little sketchy on that one im not too bitter about it theyll make exceptions even then and i should be glad im allowed to watch r rated movies at all there are certain pg movies my cousins arent allowed to see      when my father offered to let me watch the blair witch project i happily accepted society today comes down hard on modern horror movies and despite the pessimistic view of them it seems like the blair witch project is one of the few that is unanimously loved ive heard a lot about it and wanted badly to see it my father noted that the language is pretty heavy in this movie and i just blew it off with the usual ive heard worse to be honest though the language is rather heavy in this movie high school is a pretty verbose place in this day and age but even so there is a lot of swearing in this film it doesnt bother me at all obviously ive learned long ago that this is how most of the world talks and theres nothing offensive about it unless you choose to be offended by it the constant swearing adds to the realism of the movie though and i certainly cant complain about that since that is the gimmick of the movie     i actually watched this movie the first time around with a friend a friend who is easily scared and more oriented toward dramedies i mentioned this movie in passing to her and noted my anticipation towards it and she seemeddrawn in she asked if she could watch it with me and i agreed even though i heard that this was one of the scariest movies of all time i like watching movies with my friends though its fun to have someone to laugh cry and scream with as well as someone to discuss the movie with after the credits roll she was a little more talkative than i might have liked while watching it but we both were entranced by it and by the end we were in agreement that this was a great movie     what makes it so great well the cinematography is a big factor of it but its what the cinematography does for the movie that makes it such an important part it makes it nightmarishly real theres something very close to home about this movie these are ordinary woods and ordinary people with ordinary personalities and ordinary fears and then theres the blair witch were watching it terrorize these filmmakers at a much closer range than with most horror movies its honestly like were right there beside them as the witch closes in and teases them with its rituals the movie preys heartily on the fear of the unknown that most people suffer from we have absolutely no idea what the witch wants or how its doing what it does all we see is that it has something sinister in mind and its taking its dear sweet time getting it done the tension is almost unbearable and you fear sundown as much as the protagonists do     i quite enjoyed the protagonists horror movies have a knack for turning you against their main characters or something because for a genre that relies so much on you hoping for the survival of its main characters most of the movies do a terrible job of making you connect with the characters these people though they act like people you might know friends of yours or maybe cousins maybe even siblings they act very realistically with their dialogue thought processes and decisions everything they do is something you can see you or someone you know doing the blair witch project is crafty like that it tricks you into wanting them to survive i guess you might say truth be told only heather really establishes herself as likeable in this movie josh is an alright guy but he downright verbally assaults heather at one point and fairly brutally as well mike is just irritable and although he seems like a fun guy when hes in a good mood his temper is quick to rise and he acts rashly and sometimes frightfully when hes angry for all their character flaws though theyre a group of frightened and lost young adults you just want to survive it may be because you want them themselves to live or it may be because you just dont want the horrifyingly evil blair witch to win but the movie has you cheering for its main characters in one way or another this shouldnt be such a challenge for horror movies but since it apparently has become one the blair witch project passed its first test     then theres the scare tactics it uses this is a big part of any horror movie since the whole point of them is to scare you out of your mind the blair witch project has a very minimalistic approach to fear that is reminiscent of jaws alien and the shining which just so happen to be some of the bigger influences on the filmmakers who made this movie i applaud them for learning from such great movies i have nothing against gore really but theres just something more frightening about the unknown than the known this movie confounds you and makes no sense at all and thats why its so terrifying the sticks and stones have a purpose you can see it in their precision and their careful setup but what is it whats so important about these relics of the blair witch you know theres a reason but youre left out in the dark youre seeing them just as the characters in the movie are no dramatic irony no hinthintnudgenudge that most horror movies give you to me and many others that is a truly frightening prospect and the blair witch project exploits that primitive fear extensively     forget a 9 after reading over what ive just written and replaying this movie in my mind it truly does deserve a 10 as a horror movie and just as a movie in general it is a potent success character plot and imagery are all topnotch here the images in this movie are so raw and bloodchilling that theyre scarier than they would be even with proper camerawork you can see the low budget in the movie but it doesnt matter at all the effects are next to nonexistent and it works so much better for that this movie keeps you guessing right up until the end and at the end when youre really anticipating a full explanation and a reason to stop being afraid of the witch all it does is clarify things a small bit and give you even more reason to be afraid of this monstrosity i cant name anything this movie honestly did wrong length is no problem it works perfectly at the length it is even if it is shorter than most movies it feels like forever when youre watching it to be honest its a total nightmare ive grown past the age where i look fearfully over my shoulder for monsters ive seen in movies but i was pretty scared while i was watching this movie if i was in any way vulnerable to scary movies anymore this would definitely scare me to death its masterfully made and manipulative without being pushy and its truly just an amazing movie my friend afraid of her own shadow enjoyed this movie so i therefore recommend it to anyone who knows a good movie when they see one horror fan or not the blair witch project will not disappoint
Oct 28 2007,negative,how the hell was this scary this was the dumbest absolute worst movie i have ever seen
Oct 28 2007,negative,are you serious this was a movie
Oct 28 2007,neutral,impressive  i liked it  entertaining  a bit over the top at times
Oct 28 2007,negative,works the first time around but repeat viewings become a bitter dissapointment
Oct 28 2007,positive,good but it was really scary
Oct 28 2007,negative,only half as nauseating as the bourne supremacy
Oct 28 2007,positive,it wasnt the best movie but it really did freak me out the ending just gave me the chills
Oct 28 2007,negative,good at the time when you were sure if it was realkinda boring after you find otu its not
Oct 28 2007,positive,probably the most low budget film to this day but i quite liked it very realistic
Oct 28 2007,negative,as a comedy it was quite good but the end was lame
Oct 28 2007,positive,the blair witch project is like the worst nightmare youve ever had come true a fauxdocumentary that feels much like a supernatural snuff film if you understand what kind of movie youre about to watch youll be able to see just how terrifying it is
Oct 28 2007,positive,well it was sort of a new thing when it came out  im tempted to give it zero stars because of the gross impact its had on the filming of chase scenes the last few years but i guess ill be fair
Oct 28 2007,positive,i like the idea with the cameras it makes the movie feel more real not very scary though that is unless you see it for the first time and the same night you go camping in the forest  alone
Oct 28 2007,negative,oh dear lord this film sucks
Oct 28 2007,positive,lack of knowledge  fear  this was one scary movie
Oct 28 2007,negative,two hours on toilet but it was worth it
Oct 28 2007,negative,should have watched the pirated version my mate had  all crouched around a small computer monitor  apparently it was scary  by the time i saw it in the cinema it was not
Oct 27 2007,positive,even if its fake the final few minutes are some of the scariest moments ever put on celluloid
Oct 27 2007,positive,i never get scared from horror movies ive never gotten a nightmare from one because i know theyre not real why this one is an exception im not saying i completely believe the story and footage but because theres a chance that this may have actually happened that is what gave me chilled even if the story isnt true it was still very original
Oct 27 2007,positive,probably overhyped at the time but i liked it  the kind of horror movie i enjoy  not beating your brain to a pulp with nonstop violence instead slowly ratcheting up the tension to a boil
Oct 27 2007,positive,it can send a chill down ur spine
Oct 27 2007,positive,lol this was an instant classic
Oct 27 2007,positive,i know this movie isnt real but till this day every time i was it it still scares the shit out of me
Oct 27 2007,positive,opinion is divided  personally i find this film creepy and the suspense levels are kept high
Oct 27 2007,negative,this was the most awful movie ive ever seen in my life      nobody watch it
Oct 27 2007,negative,can remember all of us going to cineworld to see this and thinking afterwards it was crap
Oct 27 2007,positive,u loveit or hate it i loved it
Oct 27 2007,negative,this movie was so stupid
Oct 27 2007,negative,i give it two stars because when it first came out it scared me to death what really gets me is that some people still think this movie was real footage but if they were true movie fans they would know that heather donahue just acted in the morgue this year and joshua leonard acted in madhouse
Oct 27 2007,neutral,i literally got sick from watching this movie motion sickness all for nothing
Oct 27 2007,positive,it scared the living daylights out of meee
Oct 27 2007,neutral,it is widely made fun of for a reason but the ending is pretty chilling
Oct 27 2007,negative,was there a point to this movie
Oct 27 2007,positive,saw it with philipp
Oct 27 2007,positive,one of the scariest movies ive ever seen
Oct 27 2007,positive,well not really scary kind of boring and dissapointing ending but still its a cool way to do a movie and the kids who made this did it for a very small budget and got lucky at a film festival and hit it big
Oct 27 2007,negative,to be honest i watched only 15 minutes declared it dumb and left the room if i can be proven wrong ill change my rank
Oct 26 2007,negative,expected more this was the first movie i saw together with my husband boring
Oct 26 2007,negative,made me sick with the camera bobbing around everywhere
Oct 26 2007,negative,the shaking of camera made me sick i watched the whole movie with my eyes closed and it wasnt because i was scared i was ready to throw up
Oct 26 2007,negative,rip off of cannibal holocaust plot
Oct 26 2007,positive,this movie is weird and i deffently recomend to people
Oct 26 2007,negative,points for creativity but overrated boring and not that scary
Oct 26 2007,positive,omg hahahaha this movie was hilarious it was supposed to b super scary im assuming but the whole freaking out and yelling random cuss word was hilarious it freaked my friend out and she doesnt usually freak out about those things hahaha it seemed so real and it was good and it makes me never wanna do somethin like that i still havent figured out wat was wrapped in joshs shirt yet intestines heart tongue wat was it
Oct 26 2007,positive,nice for something different
Oct 26 2007,neutral,surprisingand what a stir it caused
Oct 26 2007,positive,i remember when this was so scaryand sometimes it still is
Oct 26 2007,neutral,i had had similar ideas many times shame this was so badly made
Oct 26 2007,positive,the most realistic film i have ever seen anyone who over uses cgi make note but really this is rubbish second time round
Oct 26 2007,positive,eh great idea and all but it just didnt do it for me maybe if i had watched it alone in the dark all in all for shaky cam flicks i much prefer man bites dog
Oct 26 2007,positive,most people dont like this but i fucking love it
Oct 26 2007,positive,it was so scary at the time
Oct 26 2007,positive,ill give it an extra star because they made a huge profit off it
Oct 26 2007,negative,overrated and it made me vomit in the theatre keep your camera still
Oct 26 2007,negative,made me quesy in the theater
Oct 26 2007,negative,all i remember from this movie is the girl that stuck the camera in her face  her nose was running
Oct 26 2007,negative,i literally kept saying when do they die throughout the entire thing
Oct 26 2007,positive,i was scared as shit and had to change the channel when they went in the house  i dont care if it was generally complete shit it was scary
Oct 26 2007,negative,i spent money to watch this back in 1999 i was younger i didnt know what i was truly doing which is actually quite worrying because in 1999 i was 25 this is total toilet nothing and i mean nothing happens its psychologically thrilling or scary in anyway because your too busy wishing the woman who screams all the way through as dead as one review says watch this in the dark you will have a better chance of sleeping
Oct 26 2007,positive,the enjoyment one derives from this movie is directly proportional to their level of imagination  the juxtaposition of modern citizens thrust wholesale back into the days when people dreaded the primeval forest and its unseen horrors is realized here with slick visceral substance
Oct 26 2007,negative,i saw it when i still thought it was all true since i have found out that its not i no longer like it haha
Oct 26 2007,negative,great idea for a movie made millions due to it low budget but nothing really happens the hype around this movie being the scariest spoiled it for me
Oct 26 2007,positive,i think a lot of people missed the point of this film which isnt surprising due to the hype it fails at being directly scary but succeeds brilliantly in terms of story effect and atmosphere if youre looking to be scared by a movie it probably wont do the job but it is a deliciously creepy ride
Oct 25 2007,positive,original but expectations were too high going in  thanks internet hype
Oct 25 2007,negative,made me super nauseous for hours after watching it
Oct 25 2007,positive,interesting  i respect them for wanting to do something different  and the publicity campaign in the early years of the internet hype was marvelous
Oct 25 2007,negative,one of the most stupid movies i saw in the theater
Oct 25 2007,positive,i remember that at the end of the first part during the break i wanted to escape from the cinemai didnt know anythin bout this film and was completely scared  very good ideaunfortunately it can works just one time
Oct 25 2007,positive,genius concept and executionwith absolutely no rewatch value
Oct 25 2007,positive,i was pretty freaked the first time i saw this
Oct 25 2007,positive,scared the bejeebes outta me
Oct 25 2007,positive,claustrophobic terrifying brings back memories of being 15
Oct 25 2007,positive,ridiculously overrated but the first horror movie to at least slightly creep me out in maybe twenty years
Oct 25 2007,negative,scared the heck out of me
Oct 25 2007,positive,the mocumentary is creepier
Oct 25 2007,negative,creative take on filming a movie but in the end it was a disappointment
Oct 25 2007,neutral,did not live up to the hype
Oct 25 2007,negative,and thats being generous
Oct 25 2007,positive,theres no real sighting here but the sounds they make its just a very creepy effect its quite scary especially the ending part swearing words are very much used in this movie so yeah everything looks so real because its recorded by a video camera so motion sickness people
Oct 25 2007,positive,dimwitted yanks dying  got to be worth a viewing
Oct 25 2007,positive,i dont care what everyone says  i liked it
Oct 25 2007,negative,eh it was kinda retarded
Oct 25 2007,negative,this has to surely be one of the worst films in the world    maybe the hype made it worsepeople are coming out of the cinema crying and having to have counselling this film is so scaryso you go all excited and basically some people run around in the dark for a few hours then just as you think somethin might start happening the film endsgreat
Oct 25 2007,negative,i fell asleep when i saw this so bad so so bad
Oct 24 2007,positive,saw this midday at the old rodney village theateri was scared as shit when i came home sup caroline
Oct 24 2007,positive,i was one of the suckers that fell for it saw it opening night and new right away that weve been duped lovehate relationship with this film
Oct 24 2007,negative,i feel asleep during a horror movie not a good sign
Oct 24 2007,positive,i despise this movie but it scared the living shit out of me
Oct 24 2007,negative,it was definatley innovative and had an interesting concept but is just so damn boring annoying and unscary that you cant even finish it half the movie consists of the characters cursing at the top of their lungs while they wander aimlessly in the woods
Oct 24 2007,negative,what was the point  its rubbish
Oct 24 2007,positive,nice proofofconcept what a pity that the concept works only once
Oct 24 2007,neutral,awful is the first word that comes to mind but it deserves respect for being original and making as much money as it did on such a small budget
Oct 24 2007,negative,was good in its day
Oct 24 2007,positive,something one can never deny is its effectiveness and originality its no great film but it has been one of the most original
Oct 24 2007,positive,my philosophy that the things that you dont see scare you the most
Oct 24 2007,positive,see this if u dont believe in spirits
Oct 24 2007,positive,a wonderful idea not a bad product
Oct 24 2007,positive,screw the haters this movie was great
Oct 24 2007,positive,not quite pantsshittingly scary but certainly not runofthemill bullshit horror mush
Oct 24 2007,positive,fucking amazing movie
Oct 24 2007,positive,i thought it was creepy
Oct 24 2007,positive,i saw this the first time back when we all thought it was a true story  scared me silly
Oct 24 2007,positive,might not have been as scary as i had expected yet the ending scared the crap out of me 
Oct 24 2007,positive,groundbreaking for its time even if now the markets been completely saturated by knockoffs
Oct 23 2007,positive,i saw this when it came out it was scary the first time i saw it then it just got dumb
Oct 23 2007,negative,does anyone still think that this is a good movie
Oct 23 2007,negative,just not scary or interesting but one whole star for the brilliant marketing campaign
Oct 23 2007,negative,i never got into this craze i couldnt even understand the craze based around this movie
Oct 23 2007,negative,see cest arriv√© pr√®s de chez vous man bites dog which was made earlier much better freakier
Oct 23 2007,positive,this might have scared me the second most behind event horizon that and jobe downloaded it when we all thought it was real like a year before theaters
Oct 23 2007,negative,what a waste of time
Oct 23 2007,positive,omggg fucking scaryyy   ahhh
Oct 23 2007,positive,first movie to scare the hell out of me in a very long time  producers and directors did a stellar job from the making of the film to the pr
Oct 23 2007,positive,a very well made low budget horror film very subtle in the way it works but still effective enough its hard to find it scary but there are definitely some creepy elements in here the film gets extremely depressing toward the end when all hope gets lost in concept its basically just a movie about three people in maryland who get killed watching it however you do get a sense that the film makers know what theyre doing there are definitely a lot of elements taken from films such as cannibal holocaust and the last broadcast however i recommend the film simply because it is proof that people can still make a decent movie even with no budget at all it is getting easier and easier to make a movie and this film is a milestone in that heritage
Oct 23 2007,positive,for me this is the creepiest movie of all time why  one simple reason i am afraid of the dark and im also afraid of the woods at dark  the backstory revolving around this movie was already scary enough  i checked out the website just hours after i saw the first trailer and everyone involved with this movie is just genius  i saw it 11 times alone in theaters and ive watched numerous times on dvd since 1999  great movie but obviously not everyone is a fan
Oct 23 2007,positive,scared the hell out of me 8 years ago the first time i watched it but im not sure its as scary for adults or on subsequent viewings
Oct 23 2007,negative,kinda scary but mostly annoying what with all the shaky camera work nice effort but try a steady cam next time
Oct 23 2007,positive,first time i saw it i just tried to get into the movie pretending that was a real footage more or less what the first audience felt as far as i know because they were told it was well not even a drop of blood or maybe one an it scared the shit out of me and what about the special features in the dvd with all the interviews to relatives and friends plus the documentary absolutely fantastic
Oct 23 2007,negative,dont believe the hype
Oct 23 2007,negative,boring no payoff it induced motion sickness for me if you have to watch it imbibe some dramamine before hand
Oct 23 2007,positive,for a film that only cost 30 grand and made 140 milllion the blair witch project is one of the greatest examples of pure marketing genius ever the marketing plan was simple spread the rumor over the internet that this film was made from discovered real life footage taken by a college film crew that went missing while shooting a documentary on the legend of the blair witch the idea that the blair witch project was real footage of the final days in the lives of three young people and the idea that the blair witch legend may actually be true is what made this film truly terrifying   spoiler  without that planted seed of realism the film simply wouldnt work which is why its popularity wained once it got out that it was staged   of course everyone deep down knew it couldnt be real but there was just that small seed of doubt in the back of your brain saying it might be real sort of like professional wrestling you know its fake but there is that maybe factor there that keeps fans coming back for more      the only two real issues i had with blair witch were 1 even though it was only an hour and thirty minutes long i think it couldve been trimmed down about 20 to 30 minutes and 2 the lack of camera stability which added to the realism was a little nauseating at times and left me with a slight headache afterwards
Oct 23 2007,negative,one of the worst films of all time
Oct 23 2007,positive,more people should like this i think its a great way to make a horror film
Oct 23 2007,negative,stupid movie in my oppinion
Oct 23 2007,positive,quite scary indeed a very good example of viral marketing on the internets
Oct 23 2007,positive,retarded cant believe how much hype surrounded it and how much of a letdown it was after seeing it only wish i wouldve thought of it first bc id be rich
Oct 23 2007,negative,i actually paid to go see this
Oct 23 2007,positive,had everyone goin didnt it
Oct 23 2007,positive,loved it i know a lot didnt but i thought and still think i have it on dvd that it was such a cool idea for a movie and a marketing campaign highest margin ever made on a movie now why didnt i think of that
Oct 23 2007,positive,if you claim not beeing scared watching this you are a fking liar
Oct 23 2007,positive,very good psychological thriller
Oct 22 2007,negative,one of the worst scary movies of all time
Oct 22 2007,positive,this film is the best of the found footage films in which the shakey cam works as for the need to have the camera running at all times this film is full of scares and shows the true nature of what it means to not show us the monster what we dont see scares us the most and at no point does it talk down to us or treat the audience like an idiot
Oct 22 2007,negative,this movie was one of the worst things ever made disgraceful doesnt even come close to this pile of crap
Oct 22 2007,positive,wow this movie was so moving i barfed in the parking lot immediately afterwards
Oct 22 2007,positive,creepy wellfilmed and realistic
Oct 22 2007,positive,its an interesting and creepy movie but it wasnt worth the hype i have to give this film credit for constantly trying to scare the audience with suspense and the unknown as opposed to ludicrous gory methods of slaughter
Oct 22 2007,positive,this movie was great when i saw it in the theatre not knowing anything about it
Oct 22 2007,positive,first time seeing it credit
Oct 22 2007,negative,scary  i think not
Oct 22 2007,positive,the one situation you wouldnt want to be in
Oct 22 2007,positive,disturbing on first watch small budget and production show that true horror can be created without excessive gore and scares    however loses its effect on multiple viewings on 2nd viewing the project quickly degrades in to explicativelaced conversation and annoying dialogue    still worth a viewing  in a dark room  alone  in a forest  with no indoor plumbing
Oct 22 2007,positive,not too bad but the hype over that movie was to much still very enjoyable
Oct 22 2007,positive,this movie is original but so not scary  i was scared for maybe a whole two minutes but falling asleep from bordem the rest of the time
Oct 22 2007,negative,made me feel ill not worth its hype
Oct 22 2007,positive,really phucking scary d
Oct 22 2007,positive,not a fan but revolutionary in its day
Oct 22 2007,neutral,i liked it by then but now its like well whats the big deal
Oct 22 2007,negative,kinda boring movie realy  was it supose to be scary
Oct 22 2007,negative,aids garbage crap three things that are better than this movie
Oct 22 2007,neutral,scary movie but i hated the ending
Oct 22 2007,positive,a really important film in the horror genre using homevideo style photography as another layer of narrative and to provide gritty realism when the film was released the first audiences thought that the footage was real adding to the strange horror of the story just dont bother with the sequel    also interestingly one of the highest dialogue fck counts
Oct 22 2007,positive,still confused by ending though
Oct 22 2007,negative,great example of conning advertisers in one medium who know little about anothershame about the product
Oct 21 2007,positive,looking back i may have been a bit naive the first time i watchedreviewed this film it has a great buildup and is a brilliant concept the part where they find the bizarre contraptions in the woods scared the hell out of me unfortunately the anticlimactic ending really disappointed me
Oct 21 2007,neutral,i really liked it even if it isnt high art it is scary and worth watching more than once
Oct 21 2007,negative,i saw this at the angelika with run lola run playing next door the thumping bass kind of ruined the ambience
Oct 21 2007,positive,very creepy and very rare kind of film i hate the people who made it because it is something i could have done and become a millionaire love it though
Oct 21 2007,negative,proof that a handheld camera and a budget of zip dont always make for a great movie
Oct 21 2007,negative,not really worth seeing
Oct 21 2007,negative,i wish they would have died in the first half hour
Oct 21 2007,positive,no replay value but decent the first time of watching
Oct 21 2007,positive,this was the freeking scariest movie ever
Oct 21 2007,negative,what a pile of shite
Oct 21 2007,positive,this is an enjoyable film experience if you want to see a real experimentation with the medium  its worth the price of admission to see a good idea executed so well  im not an avid horror flick watcher so its affect on the grenre is null to me but i enjoyed this movie none the less
Oct 21 2007,negative,seriously this is a piece of shit
Oct 21 2007,negative,i thought this was scary as hellbut when i was watching it i thought it was a true story
Oct 21 2007,negative,what a disappointment this film was a joke

Oct 21 2007,negative,i can take a camera next time i go camping if you want
Oct 21 2007,positive,loved it when i saw it in the theatre
Oct 21 2007,positive,fantastic idea well made very creepy
Oct 20 2007,positive,fuckin hilarious lol
Oct 20 2007,positive,it had the spook  just forget there was a sequel
Oct 20 2007,negative,so much hypefailed to deliver
Oct 20 2007,positive,poor movie with amazing ending
Oct 20 2007,neutral,only the last scene is good
Oct 20 2007,negative,nothing to be scared of because this was a movie pretending to be a documentary and all of us were cheated
Oct 20 2007,negative,this wasnt even remotely scary or plausible the making of mockumentary that played on mtv before it opened didnt help the believability any
Oct 20 2007,positive,freakin scary too freakin real
Oct 20 2007,neutral,its a one trick pony novelty  if you know someone who hasnt seen it watch it just to see their reaction  otherwise kinda corny
Oct 20 2007,positive,totally good movie to watch when it is actually night time kinda made us all debate on this movie was this orcherstrated or was it downright real issh hmm i really thought fiction was real
Oct 20 2007,positive,i liked this movie because it wasnt just a great horror film it was an analysis of human psyche great
Oct 20 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me when i first saw it wow i love it
Oct 20 2007,positive,it was freaky in the forest when they see those wooden figures  it left me wondering whether the socalled legend was true
Oct 20 2007,neutral,i just have to laugh
Oct 20 2007,negative,a test of what matters more the product or the advertising
Oct 20 2007,negative,stupid and intelligence insulting
Oct 20 2007,negative,what a waste of time and money
Oct 20 2007,positive,i won tickets to see the premier of this and i really enjoyed it a couple of people ran out of the cinema half way through
Oct 20 2007,positive,a true avantgarde in the world of independent filmmaking    i dont care what you think the blair witch was haunting and i still consider it a classic
Oct 19 2007,negative,augh  trees are scary
Oct 19 2007,negative,not that good  12 star for the girl being in a steak n shake commercial while people were still discussing whether or not this movie was real
Oct 19 2007,neutral,saw it at the drivein pretty freaky at the time pretty lame and irritating  now
Oct 19 2007,positive,the first time i saw it i have to admit it scared the shit out of me
Oct 19 2007,positive,pretty scary the first time i saw it
Oct 19 2007,positive,still an incredible exercise in the study of fear
Oct 19 2007,positive,this used to scare me so bad
Oct 19 2007,positive,eery and fun to watch except the camera jiggling still afraid of woods and old abandoned houses because of it
Oct 19 2007,negative,nice concept but when the best thing you can say about a film is that it had a brilliant marketing scheme you know the film itself cant be very good
Oct 19 2007,negative,of all the trees that have fallen in the forest why is this the one that was heard
Oct 19 2007,positive,one of those movies thats good the first time you see it like the 6th sense but once you know its not a real thing it takes the fun out of it i saw it in the theaters opening weekend when no one knew what it was or if it was real or not and that was one of the best theater experiences ive ever had
Oct 19 2007,negative,i dare you to watch it twice you know what ill up the ante triple dog dare ya
Oct 19 2007,negative,my dad still wants his money back for renting this
Oct 19 2007,negative,im not particularly fond of horror films but i heard so much good things about this one that i decided to finally give it a try im easily scared so i thought that this movie would make me jump of my seat i was so wrong  its supposed to be intelligent tense and original but its actually boring uninspired and well empty  the documentary style is ok the first 20 minutes but by the end of the movie you will be sick literaly and tired of looking at leaves and out of focus shots its also too long even at 80 minutes  overall this is an awful film
Oct 18 2007,positive,this was scary in 1999 but has since lost relevance i still like it though
Oct 18 2007,positive,does anyone have this
Oct 18 2007,positive,this film will crawl under your skin and stay there for days youll love it if you can approach it with an open mind forgive the jerky camera movements and emmerse yourself in the drama deserves credit for its uniqueness clever and ingenious work
Oct 18 2007,negative,the ad campaign for this was much better
Oct 18 2007,positive,brilliant do i need to say anything else
Oct 18 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me couldnt sleep the following night too bad the magic disappears after the first time
Oct 18 2007,positive,i realy enjoyed this one  of the best  films in ages  go see
Oct 17 2007,neutral,pretty freaky but didnt like the movie much
Oct 17 2007,negative,they get a star just for all of the money they took from the rubes that went to see it in the theaters
Oct 17 2007,negative,what was all the fuss about
Oct 17 2007,negative,boring and probably responsible for the cavalcade of viral advertising since
Oct 17 2007,positive,scared the crap out of me when i first saw it that the footage was real
Oct 17 2007,positive,omg i was watching this movie all by myself in the theatre creepy and good
Oct 17 2007,positive,i had to sit in a well light coffee shop for about an hour of two after watching this before i could go home to bed something about standing in the corner and the descriptions of horse hair freaked me right out unfortunately the movies popularity is also its downfall its become so clich√© that i dont think this one is going to last the test of time
Oct 17 2007,positive,initially a great attempt at filmmakingwears off soon

Oct 17 2007,positive,i dont care about the way its been received over the years this films seeming onenote premise oozes over the brim with suspense by striking one note as hard as it can we dont know whats in the dark but our imaginations of what it could be scares the hell out of us

Oct 16 2007,positive,was good when it first came out but not one to be watched over and over againthe end still gets me thoughoh and its put me off camping for life
Oct 15 2007,negative,interesting experiment but annoying to watch worst ending ever  
Oct 15 2007,negative,possibly one of the stupidest things ive ever seen
Oct 15 2007,positive,excellent horror film the accumulation of events is very well done its not loaded with scares as its tone and mood rise to a fever pitch by the endif that makes sense

Oct 15 2007,positive,i gotta be honest the first time i saw this i hated it its just a rip off of cannibal holocaust i bought it anyway and recently re watched it with my daughter and it scared the living daylights out of her seeing it through her eyes i sorta saw what the hype was about and didnt necessarily like it but i didnt hate it either hence the 3 stars
Oct 15 2007,positive,as a hiker this creeped me out
Oct 15 2007,positive,it wasnt really good but it definitely scared me
Oct 15 2007,positive,omg i love this movie sooooo sooooo much

Oct 15 2007,negative,i wish i made this but i dont really wish to watch it again
Oct 15 2007,positive,not as scary as i thought it would be  but it has some creepy stuff in it
Oct 15 2007,positive,original  a cool concept and more of a cultural phenomenon than a film  it was the idea that when the movie came out most people believed it was real thanks to savvy internet marketing techniques and pseudonews headlines  now that we all know it was a hoax even the legend the magic is gone
Oct 15 2007,negative,lets all get a camera and go to some haunted place and scream our asses off for the fun of it

Oct 15 2007,negative,my wife threw up from the hand held camera work and i waited for the rest of the movie after the credits what a ripoff it holds the most money made for leat expense but that didnt take into account the tv documentary teaser most commercial channels ran as factual to pre hype itwhat a load of shite
Oct 15 2007,positive,one of theif not the scariest film ive ever seen

Oct 14 2007,negative,complete waste of a couple of hours of my life that i wish i could have back
Oct 14 2007,positive,very scary for its time it scared me a lot i was so young
Oct 14 2007,negative,kind of an interesting premise but teenagers running around with a shakey camera accentuated by me not knowing exactly what im supposed to be scared of killed this movie

Oct 14 2007,positive,scary somewhat kinda weird
Oct 14 2007,negative,i liked it when i thought it was real then i saw the cast at an mtv awards showkilled it

Oct 14 2007,positive,i was scared shitless when i saw this in theaters  i havent seen it since so id probably hate it now
Oct 14 2007,positive,so much hype so little end product
Oct 14 2007,positive,damn those kids voices outside of the tent sure are creepy heather donahue is a terrible actor she just tries too much  but this is a cool original film that surprised me a great deal

Oct 12 2007,positive,so much swearing but that just makes the movie seem real great movie scary i couldnt tell if it was a real footage or fake
Oct 12 2007,negative,what was this crap  seriously one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life  there is nothing scary about thisits just plain stupid and a waste of time  and the shaky camera work gave me a migraine

Oct 12 2007,neutral,went to college with donohue
Oct 12 2007,positive,good for what it was nothing groundbreaking
Oct 12 2007,positive,kinda suspenseful  from allmovie if youve ever been camping in the woods you know that a campfires light doesnt reach more than a few feet into the darkness but someone in that darkness can see you for a mile taking this creepy concept to its extreme a couple of florida film school grads turned 50000 into more than 100 million  proving to hollywood that you dont always have to spend money to make money directors daniel myrick and eduardo s√£√¢nchez dropped their three actors heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams in the woods with video cameras providing them with instructions and supplies by the end of the film its easy to forget that these people arent actually in mortal danger we really do believe theyre terrified the blair witch project is extraordinarily successful at dissolving the boundaries between film and viewer fiction and reality reaction to the film is often highly mixed with some viewers finding little suspense in the studentproject concept donahues character does become a little grating and those prone to motion sickness should be forewarned there is no respite from the jerky camerawork but even if you dont feel the blair witch project lives up to its considerable hype its worth seeing simply for its creative achievement  one that proves that less can indeed be more
Oct 12 2007,neutral,according to the production cost it was not bad
Oct 12 2007,positive,the end freaked me out
Oct 12 2007,positive,ignore the hype ignore the criticism great film very original
Oct 12 2007,positive,saw this in toronto knowing nothing about it and it blew me away
Oct 12 2007,positive,this one is lamei was laughingthis is not so frightening  in 1994 film students heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard set out to produce a documentary about the fabled blair witch they travel to burkittsville maryland formerly blair and interview locals about the legend of the blair witch the locals tell them of rustin parr a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods where he tortured and murdered them parr brought the children into his homes basement in pairs parr forced the first child to face the corner and listen to their companions screams as he murdered the second child parr would then murder the first child eventually turning himself in to the police parr later pleaded insanity saying that the spirit of elly kedward a witch hanged in the 18th century had been terrorizing him for some time and promised to leave him alone if he murdered the children the trio also interviews mary brown a local eccentric who tells them that she had encountered the blair witch as a child    the second day the students begin to explore the woods in north burkittsville to look for evidence of the blair witch along the way a fisherman warns them that the woods are haunted and recalls a time that he had seen strange mist rising from the water the students hike to coffin rock where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century and then camp for the night the next day they move deeper into the woods despite being uncertain of their exact location on the map they eventually locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small cairns they set up camp nearby and then return to the cemetery after dark josh accidentally disturbs a cairn and heather hastily repairs it later they hear crackling sounds in the darkness that seem to be coming from all directions and assume the noises are from animals or locals following them    the following day they attempt to return to their vehicle but cannot find their way they try until nightfall when they are forced to set camp that night they again hear crackling noises but cannot see anything the next morning they find three cairns have been built around their tent during the night as they continue trying to find their way out of the woods heather realizes that her map is missing and mike later reveals that he kicked it into a creek out of frustration the previous day josh and heather attack mike in a fit of intense rage they then realize they are now hopelessly lost and decide to simply head south soon they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees that night they hear more strange noises including the sounds of children and bizarre morphing sounds when an unknown force shakes the tent they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until dawn upon returning to their tent they find that their possessions have been rifled through and joshs equipment is covered with slime causing them to question why only his belongings were affected as the day wears on they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier despite having traveled directly south all day and again set camp completely demoralized at having wasted the entire day seemingly going in circles    the next morning josh has disappeared after trying in vain to find him mike and heather eventually break camp and slowly move on that night they hear josh screaming in the darkness but are not able to find him the next morning heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent later inspection reveals it contains bloodsoaked scraps of joshs shirt as well as teeth and hair but she does not mention this to mike    that night heather films herself apologizing to the coproducers of her project as well as her family and breaks down crying terrified that something terrible is hunting them later they again hear joshs agonized cries for help but this time they follow them and discover a derelict abandoned house in the woods hanging on the front of the house is the same human stick figure that they saw in the woods mike races upstairs following the voice while heather tries to follow mike then claims he hears josh in the basement he follows the sound and after what seems to be a struggle goes silent and drops to the floor heather runs down to the basement screaming for mike but gets no answer she then enters the basement looking for both men and her camera catches a glimpse of mike facing the wall heather then screams as she and her camera drop to the floor there is only silence as the footage ends 
Oct 12 2007,negative,the only thing that was good about this movie was the ending which you had to think back to the beginning of the film to understand
Oct 11 2007,negative,the only thing this movie offered me was a lesson in advertising by hype and how reviews seem to judge a movie not on its quality but on the publics expectations
Oct 11 2007,negative,boy was this one stupid
Oct 11 2007,positive,creepy the first time i saw it i actually believed it that time
Oct 11 2007,positive,knees shaking the whole time

Oct 11 2007,neutral,i dont think anything defines 1999 better then bwp
Oct 11 2007,positive,so crazy very good idea for a movie
Oct 11 2007,positive,great concept  eventually ruined by hollywood sequel
Oct 11 2007,negative,possibly the worst famous movie ever can you even give it no stars
Oct 11 2007,negative,extremely annoying to watch  i have no idea why this became any more popular than my home videos
Oct 11 2007,positive,great movie  still to this day the movie comes up at campouts

Oct 11 2007,negative,this movie must be a whore because it sucked dick
Oct 11 2007,positive,one of my favourite horror films  i saw this at the cinema and everyone went very very quiet when it finished
Oct 11 2007,positive,this movie started out as a fantastic idea  the movie was made for next to nothing but the way it was filmed lets your imagination get the best of you  the pr campaign behind this movie gave it just the right hype  if you like scary movies you should defiantly see this movie
Oct 11 2007,negative,hasnt stood the test of time  and what happened to all the supposed prequels  sequels
Oct 10 2007,positive,i dont think this is that great of a horror film but there are some wonderfully disturbing scenes which are sure to creepy you out not worth all the fuss but definatly an interesting and unique film
Oct 10 2007,positive,i dont think this is that great of a horror film but there are some wonderfully disturbing scenes which are sure to creepy you out not worth all the fuss but definatly an interesting and unique film
Oct 10 2007,negative,i wish you could give negative stars
Oct 10 2007,positive,watched it and nearly puked but still creative way to make cheap film with huge profit margin
Oct 10 2007,negative,tips on seeing this movie get drunk and fall asleep i promise you you will enjoy it better then
Oct 10 2007,positive,i saw this at the cimena and didnt fully get the ending until half way home in the car and it hit me like a brick wall  great film  scary as you like
Oct 10 2007,positive,i love this movie it breaks the fourth wall so perfectly and does it better than any of its imitators  including george romero wait until you see diary of the dead the characters are really well rendered and thier fear seems so real that it becomes yours its all so effective that the fact that almost nothing happens at the end is almost inconsequential this movie is about fear not monsters its hard to believe that this came out before mtvs attempt to recreate the same thing for real
Oct 10 2007,neutral,as a concept it is understandable why the sanchezmyrick debut became a us sleeper hit the foulmouthed language got incredibly annoying and spoiled the genuine spooks generally horror films annoy me and blair witch was no different some brilliant momentsan interesting concept that you never actually see these supposed witches sanchez and myrick were super cruel to truly freak out their cast the money from this project should be in their hands
Oct 10 2007,negative,boring  and the end  that was boring too
Oct 10 2007,negative,not as good as the hype
Oct 10 2007,neutral,masterpiece of marketing  not of the cinema

Oct 10 2007,negative,some youngsters project about searching for the wicked whitch in the woods and they get hunted down one by one  it might seem scary for a 3 year old kid but i wasnt even frightened i mean you dont get to see any monsters or the whitch at least nether do i understand the ending of the movie seeing the wall and the girl screams what the why what happened if i ever wanna see scary movies there must be killers in them and atleast that we see them where they are and how they kill their preys in other words boring piece of shit i might even rather see titanic which must be one of the most boring movies ever
Oct 10 2007,negative,way overhyped walking out of the cinema im thinking was that it i want my  back
Oct 10 2007,positive,decent but overrated
Oct 9 2007,positive,cool the first time you see it eh
Oct 9 2007,negative,how someone can actually take this obviously fake documentary seriously is beyond me i guess the world has too many naive superstitious people the film has so many revealing things in it like audio continuing from one clip to another that is supposed to take place several hours later the whole thing is so obviously staged that youd have to really want to believe it to believe it the film has no actual scares just a bunch of sequences that might seem scary if you believe them which requires you to be very naive what could have been a decent enough attempt at a semiscary documentary is ruined by it containing scenes that there is no possible reason that any sane person would filmif it were real including arguments fights and various pointless conversations the worst thing about this film is that there are actually people who believe it people who think that this film was a true documentary and that everything on the film happened i cant believe that there are people who are actually that naive and superstitious that theyll accept something so blatantly obvious fake as real i mean i dont have anything against people who believe in ghosts and witches not at all dont believe any of it myself but i wouldnt entirely write it off as rubbish if someone was trying to convince me it does exist but to go from believing in it to grabbing something so obviously fake and try to pass it off as evidence in these phenomenons i mean had they actually documented something real something that actually happened that cant be scientifically explained then i would say that the movie actually accomplished something but it doesnt it just preys on naive superstitious people no one and i do mean no one in their right mind could possibly accept any part of this rubbish as real the whole thing reeks of staged i wont even comment on plot acting or character development as its all nonexistent this movie is just plain bad it has no actual positive qualities please do yourself a favor dont watch this movie as it will just waste an hour and a half of your life and you will not have gained anything any new knowledge at all by the end of this awful excuse for a movie i dont recommend this to anyone seeing how all it is is the ultimate proof that there are too many ignorant naive people in the world honestly thats the only possible reason i can come up with for this movie to gain so much popularity avoid at all costs lame slow and amateurish
Oct 9 2007,negative,what a deuce with great marketing  lets spend seven dollars on a movie and millions on marketing to see what we can come up with  i just saw this in 2008 because i wanted to avoid getting motion sickness and feeling like i had been conned by someone pedaling crap for cash
Oct 9 2007,neutral,not a great movie but still managed to scare the crap out of me
Oct 9 2007,positive,scary as hell love the low budget non hollywood aspect still see the little kid standing in the corner arrgh
Oct 9 2007,positive,which barnes and noble do these kids work at now
Oct 9 2007,positive,it would have been better had people actually died
Oct 9 2007,positive,it actually scared me the ending was freakish i love how people thought the actors were really missing lol
Oct 9 2007,positive,a revolutionary movie its difficult to judge because it just so unconventional but it is pretty much a perfect movie and it was scary so i guess it served its purpose we see real fear manifest itself in the most realistic way possible the acting was perfect as was the camerawork and even though it was staged they did actually put themselves under the circumstances and what we are seeing is real the marketing was brilliant btw
Oct 9 2007,positive,one of the few movies to actually creep me out
Oct 9 2007,negative,no not cherrie blair i started to watch then turned it off
Oct 9 2007,positive,best to have seen this when it was new  the ending hadnt been ruined
Oct 9 2007,positive,long ago still remember interesting way to make a movie less effects more imagination really scared me should see this one as far as possible away from the big screen
Oct 9 2007,positive,too much hype for what it is
Oct 9 2007,negative,this was all american hype
Oct 9 2007,positive,so i started the movie  got scared before they ever got to the woods and waited for my roommate to come home and we watched it together    it was dang scary  the ending was chilling
Oct 9 2007,neutral,not scary but gave me a headache and something to talk about
Oct 9 2007,positive,i wont lie it scared the shit out of me
Oct 9 2007,negative,i give it this rating for two reasons  good a unique way of telling a story through two home video cameras  bad story went practically nowhere
Oct 9 2007,positive,this film is scary not because of the witch but because of the mind which can make you wet your pants with fear
Oct 9 2007,positive,regardless of public opinion i still find this to be one of the scariest movies ive ever seen  of course when i first saw it i thought it was real and felt the tension of the characters as if i was there with them  admittedly not everyone experiences it the same waybut the eeriness still lurks behind meand probably the scariest ending i could think of  minimalism is the key here
Oct 8 2007,positive,i think this movie is starting to become more memorable for the divisiveness it inspires among horror fans the people who hate it really really hate it but you know what ill say it this movie scares the living daylights out of me i love horror movies but im pretty jaded slasher flicks and monster movies typically do nothing whatsoever for me theres usually a creepiness factor at the beginning before its revealed what is terrorizing the unfortunate victims but most movies lose their bite as soon as the offending monster or returnedfromthedead murder victim pops up on screen this one neatly avoids that trap by keeping everything offscreen and unknown to the viewer heightening the fear of the characters as the unexplainable keeps happening to them also when i was a kid i went camping at a number of different campgrounds each camp had its own legend that usually involved the wrongful death of a former camper who haunted the site that the adults would tell around the campfires trying to scare us i think seeing the characters in this movie interview the townsfolk about the blair witch trying to uncover the legend and then disappearing into the woods and being stalked by an unseen entity tapped into the those memories i loved those stories on those camping trips as for the movie itself while the shakiness of the camera work and the reactingasopposedtoacting argument have drawn a lot of criticism i think it all only adds to the atmosphere and it works and mike standing in the corner at the end is one of the single most terrifying images ive seen in a movie this is my top choice of movies to watch at 2am in the middle of a thunderstorm with all the lights off
Oct 8 2007,negative,garbage i recommend avoiding like the plague
Oct 8 2007,positive,i think it is more clever than it gets credit for although admittedly not very actionpacked
Oct 8 2007,negative,never figured out what the big deal was with this one

Oct 7 2007,positive,wonderfully surprising
Oct 7 2007,negative,this retard movie fking wasted my money
Oct 7 2007,positive,i loved this movie  most horror flicks these days use a ton of special effects and gore to scare people  personally i find those tactics irritating and lame  as a result i rarely watch horror films anymore  a simple movie requires a creative story and great acting  blair witch has both
Oct 7 2007,neutral,interesting as a study of people horrible as a scary movie would have been better if people didnt think it was a true story
Oct 7 2007,positive,freakd me out the first time i saw it but than again the first time i saw it it was in theaters which made it even more uber scary but after a while it subsides but a good indie film to watch around halloween just dont watch the sequel cause its like watching a bad 70 brated porno not like i know what that means 
Oct 7 2007,positive,the scariest movie ever
Oct 7 2007,neutral,dont really understand what all the fuss was about slightly chilling but ultimately unconvincing
Oct 7 2007,negative,i get really bad motion sickness so i ended up listening to the movie and only peeking at parts and i still ended up throwing up because of the shakiness of the camera
Oct 7 2007,positive,scariest movie ever my heart starts racing from the first few minutes so im convinced this film will kill me stone dead from a heart attack
Oct 7 2007,positive,i just saw it with my friend we were both freaking out in my basement
Oct 7 2007,positive,very well done lowbudget horror flick
Oct 7 2007,positive,great the first time
Oct 7 2007,negative,complete balls if you ask me
Oct 6 2007,positive,i remember seeing this on opening weekend and thinking it was real and then finding out that it was fake and therefore realizing the movie sucked cool idea though
Oct 6 2007,positive,pretty spooky dont watch this one alone and dont call onthe blair witch
Oct 6 2007,positive,one of the most important and influential horror films ever created ingenious in execution and design with masterful if minimalistic storytelling and a lasting legacy in the world of film
Oct 6 2007,negative,a very succesful marketing case study a notso succesful thriller still you gotta admire the effort
Oct 6 2007,negative,this movie is very bad

Oct 6 2007,positive,i wanted to vomit at the end  not a good date movie
Oct 6 2007,positive,i saw it the first day it came out before all the hype and it scared the crap out of me
Oct 6 2007,positive,noones been able to do the same since fucking terrifying
Oct 6 2007,positive,the end when mike is in the corner scares me more then any horror movie i don√¢t know how something so simple can be so impressionable it bothers me
Oct 6 2007,neutral,you know what  it just didnt do it for me  not really convincing not really scary  and i took an instant dislike to the chick who narrated  just sos you know where im coming from
Oct 6 2007,negative,didnt care much for the movie but marketing was amazing

Oct 6 2007,positive,i keep a night light because of this movie must see
Oct 6 2007,positive,for me one of the most frightening ever
Oct 6 2007,positive,was laughing instead of crying
Oct 6 2007,positive,probably one of my all time favorite low budget horror films relying on hitchcocks horror style of what u cannot see scares u more
Oct 6 2007,positive,great new idea back then you could duped someone into believing that it was real and these young people are still misiing sequel was a failure though
Oct 6 2007,positive,it totally creeped me out at the time but looking back its just plain funny
Oct 5 2007,positive,this freaked me out when i first seen it years ago

Oct 4 2007,negative,a masterful marketing been used as case study in so many business books the movie itself its crap the rating does not reflect its genius marketing strategy all by itself the movie is a cheat
Oct 4 2007,neutral,um it wasnt scary
Oct 4 2007,positive,first of all this movie is as original as they comesmartly written and directed and very real performancesno special effets and no background score makes this one very believable creepy and scary as hell movie

Oct 3 2007,positive,the did a great marketing job with this one i almost died the first time i saw this thinking it was real  well its still a great horrorsuspense movie
Oct 3 2007,negative,most boring movie of all time
Oct 3 2007,negative,in retrospect not that good of a film but it scared the hell out of me the first time i saw it
Oct 3 2007,negative,would have been amazing if they actually made us believe it was true ie cast members shouldnt have done interviews or shown their faces in public ever again

Oct 3 2007,positive,genuinely creepy and just crazy fuck scary in the last reel i would take a gps and oh a cellphone into the woods there but thats just me
Oct 3 2007,negative,horrible excuse for a film
Oct 3 2007,positive,this is such an spooky and creativly made movie to bad its hated by so many people nowadays
Oct 3 2007,positive,listening to the producers talk about it gives it more credibility after the fact
Oct 3 2007,neutral,haha now im kinda like wtf why did i watch that but i wont lie i was way into it when it first came out

Oct 3 2007,positive,it was pretty neat and there were some parts that were pretty spooky  in retrospect i wasnt actually scared or even nervous while watching it i think this movie was hyped up way too much
Oct 3 2007,positive,actually managed to scare me a bit but i think it was the hype more than the movie itself
Oct 3 2007,negative,this gets half a star cos there was one scene that freaked me out but what a load of crap it was pathetic dumb not even good and it made my head spin appreciate the low budget aspect and the girl heather was good but it was a very overrated overhyped piece of home made footage that i just did not like
Oct 3 2007,positive,my kind of a horror movie no stupid masks no blood and gore nothing but excitement by the time the movie got to us the hype was over so it didnt effect my judgement i simply like this movie

Oct 2 2007,positive,i love this movie
Oct 2 2007,negative,a complete rip off of a french dubbed movie called man bites dog   i laughed my ass off at the end of this crappy movie  
Oct 2 2007,negative,the greatest hoax ever pulled if you ask me    when this film was first released the fact that it was shot independently on a shoestring budget was widely known but that fact was overshadowed by its marketing there were mockumentaries aired specifically for the purpose of blurring the line between fact and fiction and the unimaginative performances and dialogue made it feel real to a lot of people take away the implication that this is real footage captured by real people in a supernatural situation and youre left with a lousy movie that expects you to be frightened by twigs    unless you absolutely need to see two collegeage kids shout the name josh for 90 minutes youre better off not seeing this movie its not going to change your life and youll probably resent the time spent
Oct 2 2007,negative,okay first of all this movie is only good the first time you see it  after that the mystery is overif you get motion sickness dont watch this film
Oct 2 2007,neutral,nice just like a documentary though
Oct 2 2007,negative,ok i was still freaked thou

Oct 2 2007,positive,i saw it before the hype and it frightened me to no end
Oct 2 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me
Oct 2 2007,positive,i was actually scared
Oct 2 2007,positive,excellant if in the right mood
Oct 2 2007,negative,gaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh hate this film crappy camera work and no storyline make for 2 hours of life wasted when you could have been alphabetising cds or cleaning on top of the cupboards crap
Oct 2 2007,positive,so many people hate this  im not one of them i loved the whole mythology of this genius
Oct 2 2007,positive,really freaky when i first saw it in theatres everyone in the theatre was sitting forward in thier seats trying to listen its great if you watch it turn all the lights off and turn the volume way up instant classic
Oct 1 2007,negative,totally sucked  what a wasted of my money when i saw that in the theater

Oct 1 2007,positive,although nothing can be seen and nothing really happens it scares hell out of me every single time
Oct 1 2007,negative,the only scary thing here is that i paid money to see this
Oct 1 2007,neutral,was scary the first time
Oct 1 2007,positive,i love this for what it is
Oct 1 2007,positive,many people out there thought the blair witch project was supposed to be a horrormovie and gave bad reviews that covered their dissapointment im sorry to say but they were all wrong the blair witch project is about the eyes of three people with only a handcam as their witness to the world surrounding them the only thing we get to see is the things they observed this fake documentary is done with such a creative mind even though we all know it was a fake the things they do is real their feelings are real and the woods surrounding them is the scariest of them all this was an experiment and it succeeded in every inch of its way
Oct 1 2007,positive,i have never been more scared in the middle of the day
Oct 1 2007,positive,ok this is the scariest movie where nothing happens  nothing but jeez its scary
Oct 1 2007,negative,im pretty sure i tried somthing similar when i was 7 running through the woods whith a camera it didnt work out right and neither did this this movie blows it reminds me of a bunch of 5th graders making a home movie and putting it on youtube not scary and not even that cool
Oct 1 2007,negative,ummmm its actually a terrible movie but thanks to some brilliant marketing turned out to be one major hit and thus ill give it a 1 p
Oct 1 2007,positive,was good in its day looking back it looks tragic only really spooky bit is at the end
Oct 1 2007,positive,damn this one is so damn scary to me
Oct 1 2007,positive,i know it has its haters but i actually enjoyed it
Oct 1 2007,negative,aparently this was groundbreaking cinema although i dont know why
Oct 1 2007,negative,wow i cant believed i paid to see this
Oct 1 2007,negative,the camera movement made me physically ill
Oct 1 2007,positive,setting aside the motion sickness this is a great horror movie because of one thing the hype the producers set this as actual footage and a newspaper i read actually had an article about where they found this footage in the woods so this is marketing genius it made millions considering it only cost a couple thousand to make is pretty good plus the last scene is actually scary
Sep 30 2007,positive,i might have enjoyed this if i hadnt been inundated with hype for this from day one
Sep 30 2007,positive,i cant be alone in wooded areas because of the last 5 minutes

Sep 30 2007,positive,im the only person who likes this
Sep 30 2007,negative,i dont understand the appeal of this movie

Sep 30 2007,positive,unbelievably frightening
Sep 30 2007,positive,3 stars for innovation  no stars for anything else
Sep 30 2007,negative,i cant believe anyone thought this was real
Sep 30 2007,positive,it really scared the crap outta me
Sep 30 2007,positive,i didnt think this was too bad until the ending the ending really creeped me out but these film students are so stupid
Sep 30 2007,positive,started the whole video diary thing not bad
Sep 30 2007,positive,kinda depends on whether you can give a damn about whining bossy snivelling ameri sorry film students somehow i can and the viral marketing was cool too
Sep 30 2007,positive,some smart ase told me it was a real docu and i didnt check and watched it thinking it was real thats why its 4  if u thought it was real which was probably me only freaked me out completely brilliant promotion of the film  it would hv sucked if people knew it was fiction prior
Sep 29 2007,positive,this sucked in the theater  shaky cameras made me sick  but at home in a dark room on a small screen  just way way scary
Sep 29 2007,positive,groundbreaking when it was first released   i had to sleep with the lights on when i came home from seeing it
Sep 29 2007,positive,this is one of the most clever movies produced in a long long long time
Sep 29 2007,positive,doing something different in horror is always appreciated and thats what this movie did at the time its not the best but still good and the ending is pretty intense
Sep 29 2007,negative,promotion of the film was actually better than the film  why didnt just follow the river then there wouldnt be this rigmoral overall it sucked
Sep 29 2007,neutral,i guess it would have been good if everyone thought it was still reallame ass hoes
Sep 29 2007,negative,one of these guys went to my high school
Sep 29 2007,positive,all independent film directors aspire to make something like this
Sep 29 2007,positive,one of the best horror movies ever made
Sep 29 2007,positive,i finally got around to renting this one yeah it is pretty slow and boring in some parts most of which are just the people yelling were lost in the fing woods f this f that blah blah blah wah wah wah and it also has a very anticlimactic ending but this one still managed to get to me a little for three kids with no money and really nothing but two cameras and some camping equipment to come up with something like this and create such a phenomenon is nothing short of cool plus i always tend to get a little freaked out with horror movies in the forest like this but that part near the end when they found the housei had trouble getting to sleep that night  good
Sep 29 2007,positive,really good surprisingly filmed on the cheap but still scary a fabulous psychological horror
Sep 29 2007,positive,very unique directing style made a watchable movie that looks like its being filmed by the characters
Sep 29 2007,positive,i was laughinguntil the ending
Sep 29 2007,negative,it was a fake documentary it had a credit for the head of photography that means it fake  and its ending sucked
Sep 29 2007,negative,i hated the guy who threw the map to river because he did not know how to read it he should have been killed right there right then    too much hype around this movie
Sep 29 2007,neutral,this was the first film i ever watched on dvd i watched the entire film in black and white not knowing that it was in colour id connected the dvd player incorrectly and for most of the film i was pretty bored but the few scary moments kept me interested too much hype but not the worst film ive ever seen
Sep 29 2007,negative,tell ya what most overrated film of its year perhaps the late 90s  people running around scared with flashlights under their chins like a bad ghoststorytelling incident at summer camp
Sep 29 2007,negative,pathetic i had for fun going for a dump during the boring and wastefull film
Sep 28 2007,negative,a perfect example of what marketing can do in order to sell the flaws of a movie as qualities    not to mention this is guilty of spawning the longest streak of dull spoofs since the matrix
Sep 28 2007,neutral,lol we were talking about this the other night
Sep 28 2007,positive,i must admit i wasnt really psyched about seeing this  not a fan of all the hype but i did find that it was quite suspensefull  i wanted to slap them though cos they shouldve known better than to get lost like that
Sep 28 2007,positive,i saw this when it was playing in one theater in dc and was being hyped as an underground ghostdocu needless to say we all realized 10 minutes into the movie that wed been duped
Sep 28 2007,positive,actually scared the crap out of me
Sep 28 2007,negative,i was fooled into thinking this was goodbut its not
Sep 28 2007,negative,i thought this was so fake and not at all scary
Sep 28 2007,positive,the begining of viral marketing via the internet
Sep 28 2007,positive,scary and you cant help but watch and feel like you are right there with them filming it
Sep 28 2007,negative,still gotta see this stoned
Sep 28 2007,neutral,concept was great but it was the hype that made it as a stand alone film and with a clear history behind it it has lost its credibility and the concept has gone down the swany conceptually and closer to the original release i would have given it a 354 star rating but as time has moved on and the hype it doesnt really deserve more than a 25max
Sep 28 2007,positive,pscyhed ourselves out so it wasnt scary after all
Sep 28 2007,positive,probably one of the scariest movies ive ever seen
Sep 28 2007,negative,utter and complete piece of garbage  i have seen over 530 movies in my life and the only one worse than this is manos the hands of fate
Sep 28 2007,neutral,overrated but still one of those movies you have to see to believe it
Sep 28 2007,negative,great marketing great idea then follows the hype the anticipation of waiting for the 31st october to see it but then the disappointment just didnt find it scary
Sep 28 2007,negative,total and utter steaming pile of shite i remember watching this on a halloween late showing and it still didnt manage to scare me all i needed to do is strap a camcorder to my dog meg and let her run around in the woods for 5mins and put it on a loop for about an hour and a half hey presto the meggy dog project much better
Sep 28 2007,negative,i didnt understand the movie
Sep 28 2007,positive,will never watch againever
Sep 28 2007,negative,could not see what the fuss was about
Sep 28 2007,negative,stupid american teenagers running around a forrest lets go this way eastwestnorthsouth if youd made up ya friggin mind and walked it one direction youd be out by now
Sep 28 2007,positive,i watch this sometimes i dont know why 
Sep 27 2007,positive,well done an actually scary movie without the gory and the gutts
Sep 27 2007,negative,i wasted a couple of seconds trying to figure out how to give this film zero stars which was a couple of seconds too many  i am somewhat ashamed that i am wasting time writing a review for the worst movie ever made in the history of western cinema
Sep 27 2007,negative,it was good marketing plot but i can pull scared teenagers out of my closet really im a violent person i am the ramsay killer
Sep 27 2007,positive,i dont care about the backlash  this movie scared the shit out of me when i saw it in the theater  of course it didnt help that the rest of my family was out camping that night
Sep 27 2007,negative,great marketing awful film

Sep 27 2007,positive,good for halloween movie watching fun but thats about it
Sep 27 2007,negative,takin a big shit of this one it wasnt worth the hype
Sep 27 2007,neutral,not half as scary as everyone made out but it was original at the time
Sep 27 2007,positive,one of the few movies that scared the hell out of me
Sep 27 2007,negative,the concept and marketing was genius  the movie was the opposite of genius  the only time youre ever even kind of scared is because you have no idea what the fuck is going on
Sep 27 2007,positive,brilliant idea and scary as hell i saw this in the cinema and shat
Sep 27 2007,negative,this is the worst film i have ever had the displeasure to sit through at the cinemait would have been cheaper and more fun to have got drunkmade yourself dizzy and gone off running into the woods shouting fuck every two seconds this is really the basis of the filmits not even a horror filmjust a very bad documentry
Sep 27 2007,negative,expect sleepless nights
Sep 27 2007,negative,i remember when this came out was meant to be the most brutal film ever haha no way
Sep 27 2007,positive,i have massive respect for this movie for great guise that it pulled on so manyi like it

Sep 26 2007,positive,original horror    the ending was really really creepy 
Sep 26 2007,positive,most realistic horror film ive ever seen i dont view the woods the same any more
Sep 26 2007,positive,brilliant if only they could have kept the fact that it was fake a secret
Sep 26 2007,positive,over time this film has grown to effect me more and more i guess it is the sense of hopelessness and venerability that is conveyed accurately the is nothing more scary than becoming lost in an unfamiliar place while dealing with the mental breakdown of your group and having the idea of being on haunted grounds a person will break when they loose their bounds with the outside world to add to the misery unexplained mysterious occurrences are happening i will admit the movie is not perfect but one thing for sure is that it feels real
Sep 26 2007,negative,one of the best movie marketing campaigns ever  however i could filmed this trash at summer camp
Sep 26 2007,positive,best propaganda ever to promote the cheapest made movie ever awesome 1010
Sep 26 2007,positive,i still think this was one of the better horror movies of the 90s

Sep 26 2007,negative,i hate this film but the ending is creepy
Sep 26 2007,positive,yes it scared me to bits  successful film
Sep 26 2007,positive,interesting intense original  basically created the template for reallooking candidcameraappearing hand held camerausing movies  the marketing around the movie was clever too creating a whole mythology around the blair witch through historically accurate websites  makes you think it really could have been a true story
Sep 26 2007,positive,ok so it was a cheesy film made by some students  and everyone disses it now as being so overlbown but i give it a good rating cause it did so well when it came out and despite what anyone says 910 people who saw it were scared shitless at the time
Sep 26 2007,negative,what a pile of tosh
Sep 25 2007,negative,this has to be the least scary movie ever  i made fun of it and the next thing i know the people in the movie were making fun of the exact same things i had just mentioned its stupid shit
Sep 25 2007,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ever made a bunch of kids running around a forest like chickens with their heads cut off is not scary noises you cant hear arent scary this movie is not scary its just stupid
Sep 25 2007,positive,first time i watched it wasnt scary second time nearly shat my pants so watch it along and really get into it
Sep 25 2007,negative,unintentional comedy at its finest
Sep 25 2007,positive,its real i dont care what everybody says
Sep 25 2007,neutral,okthis scared the shit out of mebut that isnt saying much p
Sep 25 2007,positive,actually pretty frightening
Sep 25 2007,negative,camera work made me actually feel nauseous
Sep 25 2007,negative,not the worst horror movie ive ever seen but easily the most disappointing after all that hype it doesnt even deserve the half a star
Sep 25 2007,positive,this scared me in 8th grade there i admitted it
Sep 25 2007,negative,boring and not scary
Sep 25 2007,positive,brings back good memories
Sep 25 2007,neutral,one of the most overhyped films of all time that ended up being really thrillingly cheesy in the end
Sep 25 2007,neutral,freaked me out i was like 13
Sep 25 2007,positive,im not sure how this movie was such a phenom it was kind of bullshit
Sep 25 2007,negative,bad filming due to the fact that it is a documentaryand what they held was not a big camerabut then one thing not that real is that the last shotthe girls screamingbut what  the camera filmed was still quite steady
Sep 25 2007,positive,who didnt it scare
Sep 25 2007,positive,bit of a one trick pony but its a good thing i saw this in the theater at a matinee gave me a couple of hours to recover
Sep 25 2007,neutral,overhyped but decent
Sep 25 2007,positive,thought it was real so thought it was good
Sep 25 2007,positive,i havent seen this since it came out in the theatres so i might not enjoy it as much as when it came out but i really did enjoy this film i think i sawr it twice in the theatres
Sep 25 2007,positive,when she cries its so funny
Sep 25 2007,positive,it lived up to the hype  very creepy
Sep 25 2007,negative,good but not that good  special features are scarier than the film
Sep 25 2007,positive,managed to miss  the hype for this so came to it feeling fresh even though i felt a bit cheated to find out it was all faked afterwards it still is scary you just have to wander what youd do if you were out in a wood all on your own no way out in complete darkness and suddenly there is this weird noise anyone who doesnt find this scary has never walked through a wood before its a psychological horror rather than a dim blood guts bore i dont see why everyone  thinks it is bad perhaps they felt more cheated than i did
Sep 25 2007,positive,this is a good low budget horror movie it shows that you dont need fancy special effects to make a good horror movie while it is probably my least favorite movie on this list its style was good enough to be mentioned
Sep 25 2007,negative,this steaming pile was not worth my time
Sep 25 2007,negative,bad acting and not realistic even though people claim it was found footage something to ponder when the girl says no one is left but her why is the camera moving and someone filming plus it had bad filming
Sep 25 2007,positive,i still dont even know exactly what the hell is going on in this movie in the sense of what exactly is haunting them and as stupid as it is  the fact that it looked so real and pretended to be real scared me 
Sep 25 2007,positive,i loved this movie when i saw it the first time  films that use your imagination are much better than ones that do not  saw it again and thought wow this is not that good  seeing it in a pitch black theater and not knowing what would happen made it fun  knowing already ruins the whole thing  roger ebert gave it 4 out of 4  i think 3 out of 5 after a second watching
Sep 25 2007,positive,good once and should be locked awayforever
Sep 25 2007,negative,it doesnt let you give no stars that would be my rating
Sep 25 2007,negative,the biggest waste of time ever i watched this when i got scared at everything and this didnt even effect me
Sep 25 2007,positive,better than you think
Sep 25 2007,positive,it took me a long time to realize that this never really happenedstupid of me p
Sep 25 2007,negative,biggest let down of all time
Sep 25 2007,positive,only seen it the once when it came out at the cinema thought it was great i think once is enough though
Sep 25 2007,positive,lol this was great good style
Sep 25 2007,positive,when i first saw this it was pitch black in my room and i was extremely scared
Sep 25 2007,positive,you watch it now and scratch you head like what the fuck this movie actually scared people not to mention me seriously this movie was pure genious
Sep 25 2007,positive,one of the best horror films in the past decade
Sep 24 2007,negative,over rated not scarey
Sep 24 2007,positive,ahhhh chris this reminds me of our camping trip
Sep 24 2007,positive,the thing that makes this so scary is that its so possible the way it was filmed and the acting made it that much better
Sep 24 2007,negative,fuck this movie and everyone scared by it
Sep 24 2007,positive,yeah its intense and pretty freaky but at the same time youre sitting there going wtf
Sep 24 2007,positive,it was freaky the first time you saw it funny the second and lame every time after
Sep 24 2007,negative,i was not scared at all when i originally saw this and ps i thought the ending was stupid as hell i saw this with my family at the 3 back when it still used to be there the only scary part was the pitch black part in the tent when you couldnt see what was going on
Sep 24 2007,negative,when i saw this in the theatre clear throat my friends had convinced me that this was real footage and i was freakedout
Sep 24 2007,positive,i watched it recently now that the media attention and the parodies have fizzled out of memory i could see this film for what it is a horror masterpiece  one of the only films to scare me
Sep 24 2007,negative,i could make a better film with my cell phone
Sep 24 2007,positive,it was innovative and that deserves enough credit it was scary too using the camera like that was genius
Sep 24 2007,neutral,so the last scene is very cool  if relatively inexplicable it was all i really remembered when i rewatched thisand now i see what the reviewer meant who said that blair witch loses its power with each viewing and that its certainly more impressive as a media phenomenon than a movie
Sep 24 2007,positive,i know this isnt a popular opinion but i really liked this movie
Sep 24 2007,positive,although it is not scary it is actually a pretty good film
Sep 24 2007,positive,brilliant the scariest movie i have ever seen
Sep 24 2007,positive,all hype aside the blair witch project is an okay movie given the budget they did a good job with what they had in making an atmospheric creepy film i also like how they dealt with the witch for most of the movie what you cant see is usually much scarier than what you can see unfortunately theres only so far you can go with that aspect the suspense keeps building but there is no payoff at all you wait the whole movie for the big scare that never comes by the end i would have even been okay with a cheap jump scare eventually once you realize that nothings really going to happen whatever tension was there completely disappears
Sep 24 2007,positive,i was that dude that threw up from watching it
Sep 24 2007,positive,i really liked this movie  it is unique
Sep 24 2007,positive,lol this just makes me laugh now
Sep 24 2007,positive,even if its just a bunch of random yelling a swearing crap its really realistic and creeped me out love the ending made me think
Sep 24 2007,negative,worst horror flick i watched since the remake of the omen anyone want to buy this off of me i sell the movie as is it looks okay to me but i am not a computer geek so i dont know the exact quality shoot me a message and i will see what i can do pretty much the cost of shipping rounded up to the nearest dollar would suffice the props were severely low budget the girl should give her a 5 lettername rhyming with one of the titles words screamed relentlessly there was no scary climax or ending i wanted to scream the obvious solution start a forest fire on the opposite side of the rivers that you constantly see burn the whole place to the ground i have seen spoofs off this film that are more worthy of being watched it should have won all the razzies i didnt even like any of the characters at the end i was happy to see the girl die in a way because she was so obnoxious by the way i loved paranormal activity so you cannot say that i was looking for explosions or blood i was looking for something substantial to say that this movie was worth something screaming obscenities does not make anything scary looking at piles of rocks does not scare me
Sep 24 2007,positive,ground breaking hah
Sep 24 2007,negative,i want a refund please can i have 90 minutes of my life back
Sep 24 2007,negative,pretty good for its time now very cliche
Sep 24 2007,positive,this movie reflect the sort of things were really afraid of the unseen i did like it
Sep 24 2007,positive,this really scared me the first time i saw it but then i watched it again and it wasnt that bad
Sep 24 2007,negative,another boring movie
Sep 24 2007,positive,it was good when i thought it was real but whats with the sequel
Sep 24 2007,negative,i saw this i think when i was in the 5th grade scared the shit out of me
Sep 24 2007,negative,i got a headache watching thisnot scary at all
Sep 24 2007,positive,i liked the marketing strategy of the movie more than itself p
Sep 24 2007,positive,it was kind of scary when i saw it in the theater but probably not worth seeing again
Sep 24 2007,negative,i found this movie incredibly disappointing  i didnt find it scary and all the camera movement actually made me feel ill
Sep 24 2007,positive,it scared me more than ive ever been scared in my life
Sep 24 2007,negative,wasnt impressed the motion sickness probably didnt help my opinion any
Sep 24 2007,positive,this is one the only movie ive ever seen that actually scared me only because of the way it was filmed
Sep 24 2007,negative,most overrated pic of all time
Sep 24 2007,negative,nothing really happened
Sep 24 2007,negative,saw it when i was 7 gave me nightmares for like 3 years
Sep 24 2007,positive,i remember laughing through most of it
Sep 24 2007,positive,ucf pride or something
Sep 24 2007,positive,i liked it because i didnt let my friends spoil it or watch the internet community crucify it its a movie that needs to be watched with an openclear mind
Sep 24 2007,neutral,it was funnier to see the spoofs that this movie caused
Sep 24 2007,positive,hmmm i finally see it 8 years after it is releaseddid i miss much not reallyheather annoys the crap out of me as most bossy people do and the final scene is very annoying also  i wanted to see why they were screaming    good points you never actually saw the villains and it was marketed very effectively to look like it was actually real even down to the fake 45minute documentary that was also on the dvd  another bad point a lot of the scares were very cheapsomeone bashing the side of the tent  could be african swallows dropping coconuts d
Sep 24 2007,neutral,a bunch of kids go running around in the forest and manage to get lost very quickly they start turning on each other which was stupid okay so youre running around in the dark  possibly being chased by some monster so you decide to walk into an equally scary house that just happens to be in the middle of the forest does that even make sense
Sep 24 2007,neutral,this splits audiences into those that really were really affected by it and those who thought it was terrible  i have to admit i saw it on video which kind of makes more sense given the premise and ound it pretty unsettling
Sep 24 2007,neutral,expected a lot from this film  but its such a letdown  it wasnt worth all the hype
Sep 24 2007,negative,2many spoofs about a spoof
Sep 24 2007,negative,the only time i was scared was when someone a few rows back in the cinema was sick and i could smell but not see it they were ill though  it wasnt vomiting brought on by fear generated by a great horror film thats for sure the shaky camera work annoyed the hell out of me and id rather stick pins in my eyes than watch it ever again apart from that it was not bad
Sep 24 2007,positive,i loved that it was a realistic horror  in that there are scenes that are just pitch black and all you can hear are the sounds theyre hearing it builds up an incredible atmosphere and you end up imagining whats out there  much scarier than actually seeing it
Sep 24 2007,positive,ha kinda creepy if you turn off the lights and watch it with a buddy
Sep 23 2007,negative,if i wanted to see home movies of idiots running around in a forest then id make my own  theres plenty of forest and more than enough idiots around to make this movie completely unnecessary
Sep 23 2007,positive,the end scene is creepy as hell i hate unfinished basementscellars now
Sep 23 2007,positive,another movie supposedly destroyed by hype  luckily i dont watch tv so i had no idea what to expect when i went to see it
Sep 23 2007,negative,at the time it was creepy but not now just gross
Sep 23 2007,negative,haha talk about the 90s
Sep 23 2007,positive,the fake thing takes away from the thrill factor but it would be better if the stuff actually happened
Sep 23 2007,negative,couldnt sleep for a week
Sep 23 2007,negative,hokey pokeytoo much build upnot so scary
Sep 23 2007,positive,good for a lowbudget film
Sep 23 2007,positive,i wish i had seen it in theatres
Sep 23 2007,negative,probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen did people actually pay for purposely crappy footakelike filming and even worst story line the answer is yes but the question is oh god why
Sep 23 2007,negative,wow was this awful and someone tell that girl to shut up
Sep 23 2007,negative,they should have cut to the chase and just killed the kids before getting to the forest
Sep 23 2007,negative,sucked not scary at all
Sep 23 2007,positive,genius horrorthriller never done before well technically it ripped off a bad movie with the same idea but it sucked so well pretend it was original  a love it or hate it film i give all the respect in the world to it  the last 2 minutes alone had me biting my nails more than most movies have in their entirety
Sep 23 2007,negative,ugh never see this after 2 margaritas
Sep 23 2007,negative,in the movie world its a bad film however for a movie that was made by a handfull of students for a school project its not that bad i still didnt like it though
Sep 23 2007,positive,edge of your seat stuff however i found it to be all talk and no substance the end really didnt have me wowing decent horror cleverly done but something lacking
Sep 23 2007,positive,this was unsurpassingly funny
Sep 23 2007,negative,mainly annoying but pretty cool filming techniques and yes it did scare me
Sep 23 2007,negative,ah to feel motion sickness again
Sep 23 2007,negative,no start no end a waste
Sep 23 2007,positive,i was scared of camping for awhile
Sep 23 2007,positive,very interesting the end freaked me out so did the bloody shirt and figures
Sep 23 2007,negative,hahaha im so scared right nownose drip
Sep 23 2007,positive,absolutly craped myself
Sep 23 2007,positive,not great but unique compared to other low budget films that came out in 99scary for a 1114 year old
Sep 23 2007,positive,genious hands down the best put together movie i have ever seen i couldnt believe how real they made the whole thing look if i didnt already know it was fake i would have thought other wise the characters and emotions are very convincing i was pleasently surprised dispite other peoples hate on the film
Sep 23 2007,positive,well not bad doesnt live up to the hype pretty scary no replay value whatsoever though
Sep 23 2007,negative,stupid movienot scary at all
Sep 23 2007,negative,ya i saw this when i was like 10 or 11 i had my eyes closed most of the time
Sep 23 2007,positive,watched it on halloween still guessing at what happened impressive how much money they made with rented video cameras
Sep 23 2007,positive,i wont pretend this movie is so amazing as to try and get other people to watch itthe rating is more or less my personal biased view i dont think it was intended to be all out scary and its a welcomed break from the loads of junk in the horror genre i quite enjoyed the lack of a visible villain it made me feel more involved in the movie
Sep 23 2007,negative,surprisingly fun to reference but thats it
Sep 23 2007,negative,i did not understand at all why this movie is done
Sep 23 2007,positive,i got seriously scared    i couldnt stand in a corner of a room
Sep 23 2007,positive,despite the over hype and hoopla about it if youve never seen it before its an interesting and unique take on horror
Sep 23 2007,neutral,everone thought this movie was so greatand i just thought it was ok
Sep 23 2007,positive,not at scary as thought it would be
Sep 23 2007,negative,oh how i wish i could remove stars from them
Sep 23 2007,negative,that was the stupidest movie i had ever seen first it puts you to sleep with the hour long talking then you are supposed to be scared that someone is pushing on the tent big woop then they showed up something wrapped up in twigs but you do not know what it is so how the heck can that be scary watching this movie was the biggest wast of my time i feel sorry for the people who produced this movie
Sep 23 2007,negative,biggest load of crp in history
Sep 23 2007,positive,i wish i could review the hour long documentary which preceded the film since it is amazing and incredibly scary without it this film makes very little sense on its own blair witch is nice but nothing special
Sep 23 2007,positive,silly gemma thought it was actualy true life film that they found its a much better film if you believe that
Sep 23 2007,negative,filmed like an amateur porn film with no money shot
Sep 23 2007,neutral,ludicrously overrated upon release praised for its originality but surely cannibal holocaust did something similar 20 years earlier its difficult to care what happens to the film students
Sep 23 2007,positive,scared me when i saw it but the camera movements just made me sick
Sep 22 2007,positive,at the end of the movie youre actually wondering if what happened is going to happen to you hopefully most of your parents didnt take you out into the forest after watching this and try to freak you out by reenacting it sadly mine did
Sep 22 2007,negative,f√Ø¬Ωing boring was trying extremely hard to spot that very scary scene as described by many and thought id missed it by a certain blink
Sep 22 2007,neutral,i liked it so much more when i thought it was real

Sep 22 2007,positive,scary at the time but its not anymore
Sep 22 2007,positive,a stuff it  i thought this movie was pretty good
Sep 22 2007,positive,didnt actually scare me i walked home through a park alone afterwards but good on them for making a movie and keeping hte budget so low that they turned a huge profit impressive at least
Sep 22 2007,positive,i actually thought this was realpsh
Sep 22 2007,positive,groundbreaking when it came out but

Sep 22 2007,positive,sorry but i loved it an absolutely fantastic and innovative idea on the horror genre
Sep 22 2007,neutral,not horrible but not too good
Sep 22 2007,positive,gained a lot of respect for this after a second private viewingscared the crap out of me the second time around
Sep 22 2007,negative,why do people like this movie it is the lowest possible budget ever it isnt scary and all the blair witch does is set up some rocks and voodoo crosses outside their tent wow it didnt deserve the light of fucking day this movie is worse than like the videos my parents made of me opening my presents on christmas and those actually had better quality to
Sep 22 2007,negative,low budget even lower quality

Sep 22 2007,negative,holy halfarsed anticlimax
Sep 22 2007,negative,i want the time wasted on this movie back
Sep 22 2007,neutral,unique experimental film that has a genuinely creepy atmosphere and tons of suspense but no substance and a ending that has all of the build but no real payoff
Sep 22 2007,negative,i think you had to see it at the right time to actually appreciate it
Sep 22 2007,neutral,okay it was low budget blahdy blah i was unmoved and deeply annoyed by all those stone sculptures popping up all over the wilderness that summer oooooh scaaary whatevuh
Sep 22 2007,negative,i didnt really like this film it was crap i dont know what posessed the people to make this film if you can even call it that it did scare me the first time i watched it but i wont watch it again

Sep 22 2007,positive,ill stick my neck out and say that i loved it scared the hell outta me
Sep 22 2007,negative,i was scared when i first saw it but i will never watch it again was just the hype around it at the time of release

Sep 21 2007,positive,i liked this moviedont care what anyone says

Sep 21 2007,positive,it was kinda blurry kinda shaky but it was ok
Sep 20 2007,neutral,marketing gets 5 starts movie one the other hand gets
Sep 20 2007,positive,someone from the school of hp lovecraft must have imagined this film it is the stuff that you dont see that is the most frightening made you second guess all of the noises heard in the woods at night just raccoons by the way
Sep 20 2007,negative,correction  dead poets society was not the worst movie i have ever seen  this was  they market it as scary and then its three kids walking around in a forest and being douches to each other and then finally they all walk into a house and presumably die  this movie sucks incredibley badly  even watching it home alone in the dark late at night was not enough to make it very scary  no good plot  excessive swearing  and idiot characters  dont watch it
Sep 20 2007,positive,dangg the ending was crazy thats just about the best part couldnt take parts of it seriously  like the part they spoofed in scary movie haha
Sep 20 2007,negative,this stupid movie made me dizzy

Sep 20 2007,negative,i thought this was one of the most borning hour and a half that i have ever had to endure
Sep 20 2007,positive,this movie scared me when it first came out it still creeps me out when i watch it the ending is just so intense even though now you know whats going to happen
Sep 20 2007,positive,possibly the best horror film ever made generally hated by everyone other than myself but i stand by my judgment ive seen virtually every horror film worth seeing and this is the only one that i find to be genuinely scary hopefully in 20 years or so people will start to appreciate it
Sep 20 2007,positive,one of the few movies that gave me nightmares not because i was one of the idiots that thought this was real but the fact that they filmed it like it was and they never showed the witch left me on the edge of my seat crapping my pants
Sep 20 2007,positive,i dont care what anybody else says this movie scares the crap out of me
Sep 19 2007,positive,some people loved it  some hated itothers it scared the sht out of and i was one of them its a cold eerie feeling all thru the film and like when your a kid what you cant see scares you more than what you canthe nightime howlsthe tent getting prodded and worse the end with the guy stood in the corner freaked me out bigtime this is a proper new breed horror and great it was too
Sep 19 2007,positive,what makes this film so entertaining is that it has the ability to freak people out even when its all real  many people blame the shaky camera dull concept and horrific acting but i find this film very entertaining and the shaky camera actually makes the film so much more suspenseful
Sep 19 2007,negative,what the hell happened here move move move aaaaargghhh
Sep 19 2007,negative,talk about dissappointment
Sep 19 2007,negative,not for those prone to motion sickness

Sep 19 2007,negative,i was maybe 11 or 12 when i saw it but i liked it then
Sep 19 2007,negative,fairly scary at the time of release but really didnt hold up at all beyond the first year of release
Sep 19 2007,negative,a better concept that actual viewing experience
Sep 19 2007,negative,haha saw this one with my mom
Sep 19 2007,positive,it gets high marks because of the hype and it totally scared me even though i knew full well it wasnt real
Sep 19 2007,positive,the blair witch project 1999  directed by eduardo sanchez  daniel myrick  starring heather donahue michael williams joshua leonardpeople often ask what the deal is with this film well its original two dudes decided to shoot a scary movie with some amateur cameras they wrote a tight script which is kinda clever and they made everyone believe it was a true story and those were actual tapes found in the forest people hated that they believed it was true but who is dumb enough to think it would be legal to show those as a film blair witch project was something we hadnt seen and it wasnt pretentious it looks shaky a bit too often but it adds some realism it jump from documentary style moments to just pieces of reality you need to pay attention to understand the ending though cause it wont give you the answer any other way it has a lot of flaws as well but seems like we are willing to accept those cause of the poor quality of the camerathe unkonwn actors especially heather donahue are quite convincing and maybe even giving a bit too much intensity sometimes its a wonder we havent really seen them in anything sincein the end blair witch project was a film hated by many praised by others and its been forgotten by everyone already
Sep 19 2007,positive,a really great idea
Sep 19 2007,negative,i absolutly hated this movie i went to the theaters to see this shit and thats 8 dollers and 2 hours of my life ill never see again         its crap
Sep 19 2007,positive,the filmaking is original i to my knowledge ill give it that
Sep 19 2007,negative,im sorry to say i even saw this movie  i blame all the promotion and hype and the fact that i was young and dumb
Sep 19 2007,positive,i dressed up as the grim reaper and stood outside my mates patio doors while they were watching this scratching gently at the window  they fucking shit themselves
Sep 19 2007,positive,oringinal and scary a rare find in modern horror films
Sep 19 2007,positive,hehe that was so stupid a good idea but taken the wrong direction i think it became a bad spoof it gets kudos for being humorous though
Sep 19 2007,positive,watched it when i was thirteen and i didnt really get but its really interesting
Sep 19 2007,positive,it scared me and those of you who claim it was crap are merely referring to what was left in their pants after watching it
Sep 19 2007,positive,at the time this was the scariest movie i had ever seenthey really did good with promoting it making people think it was a real documentary
Sep 18 2007,positive,scared the pants off me
Sep 18 2007,positive,what more can i say  this movie still freaks me out probably one of the scariest movies of all time ever hella scary you will never get me to go campinbg in the woods ever

Sep 18 2007,positive,worth it for the ending alone

Sep 18 2007,neutral,come on samyou obviously watched this yesterday this movie was original mysterious and it was actually one of the very few horror movies i remember in the past decade that scared me
Sep 18 2007,positive,somehow even before this film was released in 1999 i knew something was up the greatest publicity stunt in motion picture history hype up a dumb movie and sell it as the scariest film of all time proceed directly to the bank suckers 3 stars for balls
Sep 18 2007,negative,i enjoyed the hype but im always on board with a succinct marketing campaign
Sep 18 2007,positive,i dont know how i feel about this movie people tend to make fun of it but when i first saw it in the theater i thought it was bonechilling scary original and innovative then again i was 15 one of those movies where it takes a lot out of it to watch it in your living room where its small and you can talk to other people making fun of things is a way of diffusing fear or maybe its just not scary see i have no idea
Sep 18 2007,positive,crappy movie but it gets extra points for brilliant marketing and being incredibly profitable
Sep 18 2007,neutral,this movie is difficult if you rate this movie based on it being a hollywood feature film  then yes by that standard its not very good but the film was created by a bunch of film students who won a contest based on that standard its really impressive the ending of the movie is really confusing but all in all i was intrigued
Sep 18 2007,positive,revolutionary at first watch   
Sep 18 2007,positive,got a bad rep in some circles but id say its the second scariest film ive ever seen
Sep 18 2007,negative,i didnt like this movie  it bored me to tears with no suspense  i think i laughed a few times
Sep 18 2007,negative,motion sickness and dumb
Sep 18 2007,positive,i remember all the hype about this movie being real i can see why very realistic and believable until you read the back ouf the case and it says stick man is a trademark of artisan films just watched it again the other day for the first time in oh i dont know about 8 years still a good flick a legend in its own
Sep 18 2007,negative,such a disapointment after all that hype
Sep 18 2007,positive,i remember going to the cinema in the afternoon so i wouldnt be too scared  didnt work
Sep 18 2007,negative,ok when i saw it when it just came out when there was still all the hype about it being real it was totally good then  now i wouldnt be so sure
Sep 18 2007,negative,a bit poop if you ask me i was falling asleep in the cinema   and i hate the movie because my surname is blair and when this came out people insisted on calling me the blair witchfucking idiots
Sep 18 2007,positive,quite good actually
Sep 18 2007,negative,it was a wonderful piece of marketing but the actual film itself is complete rubbish i dont want to spend my time listening to whiny 20something yanks bitch about being lost
Sep 18 2007,negative,stops just as it starts to get interesting
Sep 18 2007,positive,i saw this and it scared the bejeesus out of me  dont know if itd be so scary today if i saw it
Sep 17 2007,positive,okay so we all know that it was dated as soon as it came out and the camera work made you sick but it was scary as fuck and acheived what it wanted to also for a couple years after you had to explain to the odd idiot that it was indeed fake
Sep 17 2007,positive,this was a good movie
Sep 17 2007,positive,the marketing was the best thing about this movie hell give me 35000 i could come up with something better than this
Sep 17 2007,positive,a very impressive case of filmmakers  turning to their advantage the handicap of only having enough cash to make a low budget student film this is a tense and atmospheric film that is aging rather well
Sep 17 2007,positive,im really scared of the dark this movie whether it knew it or not has something genuinely scary about it
Sep 17 2007,positive,if you have a vivid imagination then this film can be quite scary unfortunately i dont not your typical horror film
Sep 16 2007,positive,i always appreciate human imagination over film effects in horror films if you have a vivid one this will scare the shit out of you if you dont dont even bother to watch i find it one of the scariest films i ever saw and i dont get scared easily what you see doesnt scare you its what you dont see in this film but only imagine
Sep 16 2007,neutral,groundbreaking for the time
Sep 16 2007,negative,the stupidest movie ever
Sep 16 2007,positive,for me this was insidious and scary as hell
Sep 16 2007,negative,extremley overrated and overhyped on so many levels the 3 filmmakers are extremly irritating and annoying i can see why this was a major hit in the usa but over here its easy to see straight through it if you want it bluntlyits crap
Sep 16 2007,positive,i dont care what anyone says  i thought it was bloody great
Sep 16 2007,positive,this is one of the best most profitable movies ever made the scary thing is that they made it actually look like home videos found in the woods and that it still managed to make me shit myself with no blood and showing no violence at all the only movie to ever scare me
Sep 16 2007,negative,innovative but boring
Sep 16 2007,positive,this movie scared the hell out of me and i sooo enjoyed it a true horror  no sick disgusting stuff popping i loveddd the whole camera work it was just amazing and the acting was terrific it seemed as real as ever
Sep 16 2007,positive,pretty freaky  hard to watch i suppose the cast is pretty annoying but a lot of it is done pretty well otherwise
Sep 16 2007,negative,this movie is only important for how it was marketed it was the first movie to really use the internet to promote itself other than that blah if i wanted to watch three whiny brats walk around lost in the woods for 90 minutes i would wait a minute why the hell would i want to watch that and there my friends lies the biggest problem this movie the entire goddamn plot     an interesting sidenote does anybody else remember how people were getting nauseous and throwing up in the theater because of the jerky handheld camera cinematography that almost makes the movie worth being made almost
Sep 16 2007,positive,i really enjoyed this think it was because i was a mug and believed it was a true story
Sep 16 2007,positive,i hate to admit it but this really creeped me out  as much as it was made fun of i thought it was original and scary
Sep 16 2007,positive,great low budget filmmaking great marketing got old fast

Sep 16 2007,neutral,it was interesting until i found out that it wasnt really true story
Sep 16 2007,negative,overrated overhyped not much cop
Sep 16 2007,positive,i think this movie got overhyped and thus a lot of people trashed it yet even if you did know it was all fake the actors are genuinely talented it is a terrifying movie
Sep 16 2007,neutral,not a good date movie
Sep 16 2007,negative,ok it was still creepy even though i knew it was fake

Sep 15 2007,positive,the end drives me nuts
Sep 15 2007,negative,this damn movie actually made me motion sick  horrible too
Sep 15 2007,negative,can i give a minus i literally laughed through this piece of crap
Sep 15 2007,negative,this film was such a disappointment  the fake web pages designed to promote it were much better than the film
Sep 15 2007,positive,i enjoyed this on so many levels creepy inexpensively made creative camera work unique take on film making and acting i took it for the story it was and loved the way it was portrayed as a documentary sticks and stones is a mustsee companion to this movie it was a truly scary movie ive been waiting for a long time i think psychologically scary movies have not been done well since hitchcock the other blair witch stuff is a rip off though not nearly as good
Sep 15 2007,negative,its fake i was so pissed when i heard that    what made me even madder was the fact that this movie just flat out sucked thumbs down
Sep 15 2007,negative,i saw a bits of this movie
Sep 15 2007,negative,if you spend millions of dollars in marketing why doesnt that count in a movies budget
Sep 15 2007,positive,this is a very cleverly made movie very atmospheric and the use of hand held cameras a touch of genius
Sep 15 2007,positive,for what it is this isnt bad the ending scene still brings joy into my heart that creepy works over gore
Sep 15 2007,positive,still gives me the willies still an important and imaginative angle to come at filmmaking i especially like it in conjunction with the spoof documentary curse of the blair witch on the dvd brrr
Sep 15 2007,negative,made me feel violently ill
Sep 15 2007,negative,i was so tired when i watched this movieand i was in a dark creepy basementunder any other circumstances it wouldnt have been very scary
Sep 15 2007,positive,okayplease note that when i first seen this movie it was still believed to be real so for its creative genious though a rip off idea from cannibal holocaust i really truly still love this movie
Sep 15 2007,positive,it had me caught but i was bummed when i found out it wasnt real
Sep 15 2007,positive,new take on horror movies  it messes with your mind a little bit
Sep 15 2007,positive,hahah best night ever
Sep 15 2007,neutral,an awesome idea if someone else wants to pursue it we just fed up within like 2 hrs of the trip
Sep 14 2007,positive,hearthache for the first 90 minutes
Sep 14 2007,negative,if in the end it had actually been the blair witch in any way well might have got a better rating
Sep 14 2007,negative,much better in theatersseriously sucks on tv
Sep 14 2007,negative,i do not know what everyone was talking aboutscarier things go on in a pillow fight

Sep 14 2007,positive,im sorry i admit it i love this film
Sep 14 2007,positive,thsi is brilliant and creepy
Sep 14 2007,positive,i still dont understand the ending
Sep 14 2007,positive,you either loved this movie or hated it it scared the bejesus out of me
Sep 14 2007,negative,not scary home video
Sep 14 2007,positive,wish i thought of it

Sep 13 2007,negative,a clever really well done student project
Sep 13 2007,positive,fucking scary movie
Sep 13 2007,negative,two hours i will never get back
Sep 13 2007,positive,scream after scream after scream
Sep 13 2007,positive,budget does not determine brilliance need an example of what i mean then compare this to the budget heavier sequel in a dark room with surround sound alone this movie will scare the crap out of you
Sep 13 2007,positive,gets a bad rap now mainly due to the gigantic hypeat the time but this for me is a great horror film it pushes all the right buttons of what i am scared of and worked for me for a filmof this budget and size todo as well as it did is great inspiration for any up and coming film maker havent really heardfrom anyone involved again since but they had their big moment
Sep 13 2007,negative,one of the worst fucking films ever made
Sep 13 2007,negative,the most overrated horror movie of all time immensely boring
Sep 13 2007,negative,i paid 1 to see this and left the theatre feeling ripped off
Sep 13 2007,positive,a truly scary flick that scared the absolute shit out of me when i saw it in theatres i dont think ive ever been so scared before when i was watching them in the house oh my god at the time i watched this i thought everything was real so that added to it more it really was a genious idea to make this movie and further market it saying the people were missing very smart and yeah anyone who says they werent scared when they watched this are lying i dont believe that at all and i dont feel bad for admitting it it was truly terrifying
Sep 13 2007,positive,i think so many people hated this movie because they expected a more conventional horrormovie experience violence phantasmagoric imagery a payoff shot of the monster what they got instead was a movie that owes a great debt to the more suggestive cerebral horror of hp lovecraft in which the unseen and inexplicable are the most frightening things of all the scares here spring from primal human fears the dark being lost and isolated finding oneself at the mercy of an unknown invisible malevolent force like a good book its as scary as your imagination makes it
Sep 13 2007,positive,not as good when you know what is really going on
Sep 13 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me  still incrediby effective even though we all know its just a movie  everyone who says its stupid  can kiss my ass  this movie gives great hope to low budge horror
Sep 13 2007,negative,the only good part of the movie was being in a creepy house when we watched it and the power going out right at the end of the moviethat was a little scary the movienot so much
Sep 13 2007,negative,never understood why this film was so hyped
Sep 13 2007,positive,this is the only film ive found genuinely frightening since watching poltergeist as a kid it does what it says on the tin its minimal and what it does it does well the nighttime scenes are really great
Sep 13 2007,neutral,cheeky fucking bastards i could write a book on the pros and cons of this film
Sep 13 2007,negative,what a waste of time  not scary  stupid
Sep 13 2007,positive,there are 2 types of people in this world  people who love blair witch and people who hate it  i love it
Sep 13 2007,negative,no it isnt real yes it will make you motion sick they couldnt get away with anything like this today though since viral vids are so easy to share
Sep 12 2007,positive,was pretty scared back then
Sep 12 2007,positive,i admire the concept and ill be honest it was frightening the first time i watched it but aside this is proof you can take a pile of shit and make a bunch of money off it while getting away with not pulling off much groundwork
Sep 12 2007,negative,another stupid movie or whatever college project that was
Sep 12 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me
Sep 12 2007,negative,snot not scary retarded  zero
Sep 12 2007,negative,snuck into it the first night it was out and it was good then it was ruined by media and others
Sep 12 2007,positive,yes i like it  its a psychological roller coaster that shows horror movies dont have to have expensive budgets to be good
Sep 12 2007,negative,i couldnt sleep for a week after i saw it  shows how much i dont like scary movies
Sep 12 2007,positive,i like it of course i have a strong imagination

Sep 12 2007,positive,i saw itwasnt that scary
Sep 12 2007,positive,by the time i saw the entire movie almost everyone i knew had said that it was boooring  but it wasnt  it was unendlessly creepy and theres this growing dread right up til the final scene
Sep 12 2007,negative,novel idea  movie isnt scary though and ultimately gets boring
Sep 12 2007,positive,vastly underrated by a lot of people very clever filmmaking great concept
Sep 12 2007,negative,i dont understand what all the fuss was about i thought it was the most boring film ive seen 
Sep 12 2007,positive,this is how you make a scary movie  and they did it without showing any blood and with a tiny budget  the big studios could sure learn a lesson from watching this  however due to their limited budget theres a certain standard of professionalism we expect that this movie lacks
Sep 12 2007,positive,really enjoyed this one at the time  i love it when small really really small movies like this break through
Sep 12 2007,negative,id rather attempt to stop projectile vomit with my tonsils than see this piece of shit again
Sep 12 2007,negative,i still dont know what was so good about this movie
Sep 12 2007,positive,best horror movie ever so fucking scary
Sep 12 2007,negative,abysmal a total waste of time
Sep 12 2007,negative,up there with snakes on a plane in terms of top reasons movies should be given oscars for marketing by the time i saw it i was begging for the movie to be good buuut it wasnt
Sep 12 2007,negative,the best thing about this film was its marketing bloody crap
Sep 11 2007,positive,ok so i slated this after i saw it but in hindsight its a pretty good film that cost 30k to make
Sep 11 2007,positive,did not think this would be much of anything i have seen a freaking ton and half of scary movies in my life but this does have a classic ending standing in the corner creepy cool i have a great follow up story to this oneyou need to ask me about it someday
Sep 11 2007,positive,inventive and genuinely scary
Sep 11 2007,positive,so scary i coundt sleep for days
Sep 11 2007,positive,not scarynot great but at least it was original
Sep 11 2007,positive,wonderful it builds and builds then it stops tragic
Sep 11 2007,neutral,i actually watched teh hole thing in the theater
Sep 11 2007,positive,cool once but after that its flaws become readily apparent still the first time a brilliant undertaking in suspense and fear
Sep 11 2007,neutral,this movie was so big and so stupid
Sep 11 2007,neutral,i did not find this scary until the last five minutes and then i didnt sleep for a week
Sep 11 2007,negative,i enjoyed the promotional website more than the film itself kudos for trying i guess
Sep 11 2007,positive,lmao  i remember my brother n my cousin scared me redoing a scene from that n i saw the real thing n i was liek awsomeee
Sep 11 2007,negative,i saw this in the cinema when it came out i sat there looking at my watch just waiting for it to end tedious rubbish
Sep 11 2007,positive,very inventive very sophisticated in its simplicity smeared in the press unnecessarily this film is great because you never actually see the monsterwitchvillian the film allows you to build an image in your own mind about what the witch looks like  great idea great delivery maximum horror impact if you dont get it then perhaps less sophisticated horror films are for you
Sep 11 2007,positive,i thought this was real
Sep 11 2007,positive,u cant help but watch even though nothing happens its hard not 2 look away alot of d time as well if u get scared easily like me
Sep 11 2007,positive,terrifyingalthough i was drunk when i saw it 
Sep 11 2007,negative,all i remember from this was a woman with snot cascading from her nose everyone just saying fuck and a lot of trees   when it comes to the bit where youre like wow somethings actually happening the movie ends i know they had like a really small budget and stuff  but the idea was great  but like they guy below me said  it really really was not executed properly lame
Sep 11 2007,positive,i promised i would never go camping again ever this movie freaked me out the did great hype job on this prior to release
Sep 11 2007,negative,oh please wait to get out of the parking lot before you freak out
Sep 11 2007,negative,i cant believe people actually liked this its even more surprising that they thought it was frightening at all
Sep 11 2007,positive,i was scared shitless when i first saw this  but it only gets you once  any other viewings and it doesnt have the same effect
Sep 11 2007,neutral,woooah nutsexcept it was fake
Sep 11 2007,positive,i saw it before the hype and release over here and was one of only a few times a film scared me

Sep 11 2007,positive,innovative but dumb
Sep 11 2007,negative,hated it there i said it
Sep 11 2007,negative,the single most overrated piece of poop i have ever had the displeasure of suffering through not scary no story very boring and no epileptic handheld camerawork does not equal revolutionary cinematography
Sep 11 2007,positive,easy but really effective
Sep 11 2007,positive,i liked the part where it just showed them hiking it reminded me of hiking
Sep 11 2007,negative,sucked wanted my money back
Sep 10 2007,positive,scared the crap outta me in the theatre
Sep 10 2007,positive,it has its scares but it really wasnt something with a lasting effect because why would you go and purposely get lost in the woods to find some witch and then start freaking out because youre lost idiots
Sep 10 2007,positive,this was a terrifying movie back in the day and if you say otherwise youre a goddamn liar
Sep 10 2007,positive,not all that great it was pretty boring actually
Sep 10 2007,neutral,veru cool yet very stupid attempt
Sep 10 2007,positive,lame but pretty scarry at the same time

Sep 10 2007,positive,well i thought it was pretty scary
Sep 10 2007,negative,this movie sucks ass period try and tell me otherwise and i will punch you in your netherregions
Sep 10 2007,positive,i laughed this was pretty interesting
Sep 10 2007,positive,its not scary but it was pretty good u dont need millions of eurosdollars or whatever  to make a movie but yeah worth to watch d totally
Sep 10 2007,negative,this is probably the suckiest movie that ever sucked
Sep 10 2007,negative,people in a forest filming themselves they could have kept their shit though
Sep 10 2007,positive,good in the theater only
Sep 10 2007,positive,it gathered a lot of momentum on the web before it was released shot on a tiny budget it was thought to be one of the scariest films ever made some people felt disappointed i didnt
Sep 10 2007,negative,gimme a break the end was a little eerie though i have to admit
Sep 10 2007,positive,this was strangely appealing didnt find it scary but im amazed that it affected so many
Sep 10 2007,neutral,does not do well on repeat viewing but was kinda interesting the first time through if only because it subverted so many expectations and maintained the tension we expect from a film of this genre in ways we werent used to
Sep 10 2007,negative,should never have been a theatre releasetotal bullshit
Sep 9 2007,positive,you either thought it was the stupidest movie ever or scary as shit i fell into the latter half 
Sep 9 2007,positive,i loved it it definately scared the shit out of me
Sep 9 2007,positive,interesting premise the execution left a bit to be desired noone needs to see that much mucus in a motion picture
Sep 9 2007,positive,i may be in the minority anymore but i found this an effective and unique experience and it haunted me afterwards  really needs to be watched after one sees the scifi channel fake documentary
Sep 9 2007,negative,why is this movie on everyones good list
Sep 9 2007,negative,a great laugh  the kids and i piled rocks and sticks in the backyard after this movie  moahahahahaa
Sep 9 2007,positive,can you believe this movie it looks like real excelent make
Sep 9 2007,neutral,there was no beer on the island man if they had beer they would have had like bigass orgies
Sep 9 2007,negative,i thought this was a load of rubbish
Sep 9 2007,negative,creeped me out have to admit
Sep 9 2007,positive,puts you into the movie excellent filming
Sep 9 2007,positive,i was one of the few pussies who totally fell for this movie and i havent been able to sleep in a tent since
Sep 9 2007,positive,original but not really as good as it was hyped up to be not a rewarding ending
Sep 8 2007,positive,tremendously sucessful independent film is arguably the greatest horror film of the 90s with a truly brilliant set up the blair witch project plays itself off as a chilling true story told believably well through the cameras of the three young stars solidly creepy at times this is a film that wisely relies on the unknown to induce fear and its a very effective style a smart horror experience that deserves high props
Sep 8 2007,positive,love thisdam cool n scary
Sep 8 2007,negative,tripe what was the fuss about
Sep 8 2007,positive,i was completely sucked in  the only film that kept me up at night since i was five

Sep 8 2007,negative,would have been much better if there was a figure at the end
Sep 8 2007,positive,seeing this once is enough had nightmares for days after seeing this film
Sep 8 2007,negative,brutal movie one of the worst ever made
Sep 8 2007,positive,no its not the terrifying spectacle it was originally billed as that said its perhaps the last aesthetically original horror film to come out of the states its subversive implicit and unlike many recent horror films taps into the fear of the unseen
Sep 8 2007,negative,its not scary its stupid
Sep 8 2007,positive,scared the crap out of me especially since i was going camping the following weekend
Sep 8 2007,negative,this sucked royally
Sep 8 2007,positive,scariest film i have ever seeni felt sick watching it
Sep 8 2007,negative,i rooted for the witch
Sep 8 2007,positive,what makes this movie different to the usual mystery movie or horror film is that nothing is explicitly shown or stated makes you use your imagination a rare requirement these days
Sep 8 2007,negative,i still have a headache from all the bouncy camera anyone want to get in on a class action lawsuit the ending redeems it though
Sep 8 2007,positive,really awesome movie a must see film
Sep 8 2007,positive,good film crap ending
Sep 7 2007,positive,the end creeped the hell out of me p
Sep 7 2007,negative,i couldnt follow this movie
Sep 7 2007,positive,i dug it most people resented it because it forced them to use their imagination something mtv and its influence doesnt often allow
Sep 7 2007,positive,entertaining but not worth the hype
Sep 7 2007,negative,overrated i wanted them all to die and to die faster
Sep 7 2007,negative,sesame street scares me more than this movie did
Sep 7 2007,positive,not horrible  it definitely beats out most of what comes out recently
Sep 7 2007,negative,another movie that didnt live up to its hype
Sep 7 2007,negative,how did this do well
Sep 7 2007,positive,i havent finished watching this movie

Sep 5 2007,positive,i dont care what people saythis was a truly original movie  at the time it was a concept that had not been quite explored in the manor it was you have to really place yourself in the situation to get the most out of this movie  all that aside i think this is a movie everyone should at least watch and give a chance

Sep 5 2007,positive,a shadow creeping ominously into view through a motel room shower curtain a swimmers legs dangling tantalizingly under the water as something big and hungry glides purposefully toward them a terrorized baby sitter learning that the calls are coming from inside the house and a closeup of a single frightened crying eye of a lost camper in her tent at night her sobs interrupted as she breathlessly whispers to the camera what was that these are landmark moments in cinematic horror the ones that stick in your memory and haunt you long after the house lights go up and they only come along once in a generation if you dont recognize the last one its because its from the blair witch project the darling of sundance and cannes thats already being buzzed as the scariest movie ever made that of course is debatable  but the fact that a shoestringbudget mockumentary with no name stars no special effects no rivers of bloody gore and not even a musical score can be this spooky is a testament to the storytelling ability of the filmmakers and to their trust in the audiences imagination its been a long time since a movie did so much by showing so little
Sep 5 2007,positive,the ending hit a nerve
Sep 5 2007,negative,it was like listing to my grandparents bicker on a homevideo for an hour and a half

Sep 5 2007,positive,fuckin eh kinda boring but great
Sep 5 2007,positive,depending on how imaginative you are you may or may not enjoy this i personally did i thought it was quite clever for the film makers to rely on the audiences imagination for scares but once you see the movie your going to know when everything happens
Sep 5 2007,negative,the guy who marketed this successful movie this movie is a genious cause the movie itself is a piece of it  bad filming no action no horror nothing interresting the most frustrating thing is you never know what happened  mak

Sep 5 2007,positive,mad disturbing movie i love it
Sep 5 2007,negative,the ending scared the living shit out of me and was bravura well done  the rest of the movie sucked and hoodwinked the critics into thinking theyve seen a oneofakind masterpiece

Sep 4 2007,negative,not scary kinda creepy at times but even then wasnt that creepy all 3 of the characters were just retarded in terms of navigation and wilderness survival skills as well as common sense
Sep 4 2007,negative,id rather watch and smell a cow shit on my bed
Sep 4 2007,positive,maybe the scariest movie ive ever seen and yes i am one of those people that thought that the story was real to begin with  due to very elaborate lies by the press before opening day this is a psycological thriller  not so scary once you found out that they were actors but still scary nonetheless check it out
Sep 4 2007,positive,talk about a horror movie forget every horror movie you have ever seen  this is the real thing what is a good movie i agree that this is certainly not a very enjoyable movie the ending is extremely unsatisfying and the hand camera gives me a headache however i believe that a film is as a good as it serves its purpose and a horror movies purpose is the one of scaring you in my perception neither hostel saw nor se7en the omen the others  the ring the shining the silence of the lambs or the sixth sense get anywhere near to this movie in terms of scariness this may be because i dont believe in the devil ghosts or supernatural powers and psychopaths  another popular source of evil in horror movies  tend to lose most of their scariness as soon as they are given a human face this is how i come to consider creating fear of something completely unknown unresolved the smartest move in the history of filmmaking so here goes my humble opinion this is the best movie i have ever seen
Sep 4 2007,positive,so it was ok but its a great movie to scare ur easily scarred friends when ur out camping
Sep 4 2007,positive,one of the best horror films eva wish i was in tht forest right now with mates and looking for the blair witch

Sep 3 2007,positive,i was so scared i almost cried ill never see this movie again it traumatised me
Sep 3 2007,positive,it was alright kind of interesting at timesthen it drags on in parts over all i admire the film maker for trying something unique
Sep 3 2007,negative,some things shouldnt be blown up to 35mm and this is one of them  litterally made me puke in the theatre washroom

Sep 3 2007,positive,i really enjoyed this film the concept was so original and i thought it worked extremely well the final few scenes in the house were so chilling  especially the childrens handprints on the walls
Sep 3 2007,positive,such an amazing idea and concept  that the idea and story behind this film is ultimately more satisfying than the film itself  still i cant help but still be amazed that a film like this exists and took its hold over the country with its brilliant marketing and concept
Sep 3 2007,negative,would have given it more stars but the kids showing up on leno ruined it for me
Sep 3 2007,positive,a great movie marred by unfair hype never tell anyone this is the scariest movie youll ever see because it wont be

Sep 3 2007,negative,the only thing that made me queasy was motion sickness
Sep 3 2007,positive,8years after it came out and i finally saw this movie i saw the 2nd blair witch movie before i saw this one which is probably for the best because it restored my faith in this franchise after that terrible sequel that was clearly a cash grab
Sep 3 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me the first time i saw it after that blah
Sep 3 2007,negative,im a much bigger fan of the marketing than the film itself
Sep 3 2007,negative,i saw this when it first came out on halloween eve no lesswas sorely dissapointed 
Sep 3 2007,positive,i think this is a misunderstood movie if you want gore and obvious jumps and slashes go elsewhere this plays on the simple premise of being afraid of the dark it is brilliant
Sep 3 2007,positive,kind of sad but it scared the living crap out of me  good idea
Sep 3 2007,negative,gee these people were dumb if yr lost and find a river follow it downstream they would be sure to find a town eventually

Sep 2 2007,positive,i lived in a heavily wooded area so it scared the bejesus out of me
Sep 2 2007,negative,could have been great
Sep 2 2007,positive,many have attempted to match this films documentaryreal approach but none have ever been able to match this for sheer terror you dont feel like your watching a filmits more like your watching a horrific nightmare unfold before you the authentic writing naturalistic acting and haunting settingmaryland woods in the winter cold desolate seemingly endlessmake this horror experience harrowing in the extreme its hard to watch but even harder to tear your eyes away from writerdirectors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez are smart writers tying our three subjects together with deep psychological threads threads that may also tear them apart as the trio get lost and run out of food lose their map find themselves going in circles hear ominous sounds and see strange crude stick dolls hanging in the trees it becomes clear they are not alone they start cracking one by one the dread builds in a frightening crescendo to a finale that is nothing less than bonechilling and since we know the outcome theres an ironic poignancy to the early scenes before the woods and a painful sadness to the latter events what makes this so terrifying on a primal level how this is able to get deep inside your head and give you nightmares is what isnt explained or seen the genuine mystery surrounding the story is fascinating and riveting sure this is a highwire stunt but its one that never falters thats enough to make this in my book at least the best and scariest horror film of the 90s
Sep 2 2007,positive,lol i liked watching other people watch this movie they get so freaked out its funny
Sep 2 2007,positive,definitely welldone horror when this first came out i was in fact convinced that it was real footage although i didnt see it until a few years later it scared me

Sep 2 2007,positive,people love to bash this now but it was an original and it scared the crap out of me
Sep 2 2007,negative,audiences fled the theaters screaming in terror what kind of sick joke was that
Sep 2 2007,positive,you either love it or hate it this is a really intelligent horror that had some of the best hype ever
Sep 2 2007,positive,the movie that brought us the nasalmacro shot it was entertaining i think it was scarier for people whove never been in the woods
Sep 2 2007,neutral,overhyped at time of release maybe now without that heresay its really good to younger viewers

Sep 2 2007,negative,i go motion sickness more than getting scared but the final shot of the movie did give me the creeps
Sep 2 2007,positive,it was fashionable at the time
Sep 2 2007,positive,the most interesting thing is that the cameraman becomes an actor having to walk tilt and pause from the perspective of these characters
Sep 2 2007,negative,this seemed dumb to me
Sep 2 2007,positive,loved it but weirdly i wasent really scary at all
Sep 2 2007,neutral,pretty good not scary tho
Sep 2 2007,positive,anticlimax ruins an otherwise superbly creepy buildup
Sep 2 2007,positive,the end scared the poo outta me i wouldnt watch it again though its so overspoofed it wouldnt even be worth it
Sep 2 2007,positive,you cant knock this movie it is clever its like santa clause you just have to pretend liek its real even though they have a camera shot from the perspecive of a 3rd person when everone supposedly is dead of whatever at the end
Sep 2 2007,positive,saw this on halloween 1999 in the cinema and thought it was very good  sadly it got panned but that didnt stop people going to see it

Sep 1 2007,positive,awesome movie the first time completely doesnt hold up to rewatching or retelling but the first time its scary like every good childhood campfire ghost story is good but in hindsight once you know where things are generally heading you dont need to see it again
Sep 1 2007,positive,atmospheric haunting and somewhat overhyped a great horror movie but a bit overdone on the fictional candiddocumentary style otherwise a classic horror
Sep 1 2007,positive,aw memoriesfirst r movie i got to see
Sep 1 2007,positive,i love this movie just because of how real it is and i also love how people think these are real people that actually got killed by the blair witch  ooooo spooky
Sep 1 2007,negative,three film students set out into the black hills  forest and make everything the fuck up
Sep 1 2007,positive,to quote jack this movie really freaked me out
Sep 1 2007,negative,synopsis  three students get lost in the woods and yell fuck at each other for about two hours  somewhere along the way another group of kids ties up dolls or something around their campsite  finally they find the witchs house and one of the students is standing in the corner  end
Sep 1 2007,neutral,its a pretty cool movie but parts are boring and it is hard to believe that it is actually true
Sep 1 2007,positive,this movie is ridiculously scary and nothing happens the entire movie
Sep 1 2007,neutral,its not your typical scary movie which to me makes it even better breaking the mold and still at least putting you on edge sometimes a movie for those who dont like that fake bu shi scary stuff
Sep 1 2007,negative,i felt so nauseated
Sep 1 2007,positive,dnt watch it n ur own at night
Sep 1 2007,negative,one of the very few times 23 ive actually fallen asleep in the cinema

Sep 1 2007,positive,i actually liked this movie even though it got a bad rap from a lot of people i think if you let yourself buy into the plot youll be genuinely frightened it successfully taps that primal fear of being alone in the forest and in the dark plays on all of our childhood memories of ghost stories and legends
Sep 1 2007,positive,didnt quite live up to the hype which in itself was excellent
Sep 1 2007,negative,not scary just crap
Sep 1 2007,positive,the shit at the time but couldnt get over the nausea fest

Sep 1 2007,positive,i thought it was real when i saw it  im an idiot
Sep 1 2007,positive,i i just can express how i feel about this movie its probably the most scary movie ill ever see it was quite discusting to be honest
Sep 1 2007,negative,i am sorry if you got suckered and wasted your time with this movie minutes of my life i will never get back
Sep 1 2007,negative,creepy hate the ending gave me nightmares
Sep 1 2007,negative,so not scary you want to be scared by twigs and trees try the nz bush pussies
Sep 1 2007,neutral, at a time when digital techniques can show us almost anything the blair witch project is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we cant see the movie would be better as a 30minute short though since its shaky camera work and fuzzy images get monotonous after a while and theres not much room for character development within the very limited plot a clever entertaining stunt no more no less the great power of the film lies in its simplicity in the slowbuilding tension and psychological meltdowns that are the result of stark barebones filmmaking while it has its scary moments and while its central conceit is refreshingly imaginative theres ultimately not much there there      verdict matin√©e  mixed reaction these kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things but some bad things kept it from being amazing this rating says to pay matin√©e prices to see at a theatre buy an exrental or a cheap price of the dvd to own
Sep 1 2007,negative,hysterical americans lost in the woods

Aug 31 2007,positive,it has been a while since i saw the blair witch project and i had forgotten how good and realistic it is you can really get caught up in the drama and forget that you are watching a film and begin to believe in the story there are some scary moments the only offputting part of the film is the shaky camera work obviously this is part of the realism of amateur camera work but it can induce headaches watch this film with a paracetamol at the ready

Aug 25 2007,positive,brilliant creepy without excessive bullshit
Aug 25 2007,positive,despite what some say i actually enjoyed this film and thats coming from one of the biggest horror geeks around the premise is fairly creepymainly because the woods featured in this film remind me so much of the woods near my house three filmmakers go into the woods to make a movie about the blair witch but they end up find much more than they bargained for the fact that they filmed this documentary style gives it a sense of realism however i can see why some dont like it it does run a little bit long and theres some filler moments where not much happens blake arth says checking it out is up to you

Aug 24 2007,positive,interesting and happy to see that ucf students actually made the big time but i think i heard too much hype before actually seeing it
Aug 24 2007,negative,get a damn tripod the only good part was seeing the kid standing in the corner
Aug 24 2007,negative,it was an almost zero rating if it werent for the spooky story on the witch itself and the fact they almost made it appear like a real documentary it just spooked me out about how things just went crazy in the end and they were all lost being scared really played on their minds you never saw the witch but it totally scared me in the end when she came swooping down havent been camping in a long time but note to self be weary of twigs that look like crosses for no apparent reason

Aug 23 2007,positive,original innovative like nothing seen before
Aug 23 2007,positive,talk about a movie you either love or hate
Aug 23 2007,negative,one of the most overrated lumps of sewage in cinematic history
Aug 23 2007,negative,wipe your nose for christ sakes
Aug 23 2007,positive,neat idea gets credit for not just being any other shitty new age horror movie
Aug 23 2007,negative,can anyone say motion sickness

Aug 23 2007,positive,sad as it was i was scared next one was creepier
Aug 23 2007,negative,what a joke try camping on a plot in bapsfonteinits more entertaining
Aug 23 2007,positive,omg ifergot about this movie
Aug 23 2007,negative,really not that scary and im like scared of the dark
Aug 23 2007,neutral,brilliantly done and very scary the first time round however after that its ability to frighten just seems to leak away into the ether
Aug 23 2007,positive,i remember watching this as a kid and thinking it was true i also forgot to mention i was really dumb as a kid
Aug 23 2007,negative,great concept brilliant marketing strategy but ultimately a let down the scariness of this movie was completely over hyped as i sat in the theater watching the time instead    perhaps this movie would do better at delivering genuinely frightening moments if watched alone on a television set as the documentary style of this movie was definitely not suited to a big screen    like i said big on creativity and cleverness but sadly lacking in atmosphere or terror
Aug 23 2007,negative,would have been better if they followed through with the lie that it was a real documentary  like the credits should have been like 4 lines long
Aug 23 2007,negative,i did not understand the hype for this movie at all  i guess its impressive that they made a movie with such a low budget but thats it
Aug 23 2007,negative,im one of the people who thought this movie was a pile of poo
Aug 22 2007,neutral,this was supposed to have been scary 
Aug 22 2007,positive,this movie scared me when i was small now it confuses me
Aug 22 2007,negative,was ruined by the fact that i saw the making of the movie like two days before i saw it
Aug 22 2007,negative,some day someone will make this movie again but get it right
Aug 22 2007,negative,this movie should get no stars what a load of shite terrible i wasnt even scared once
Aug 22 2007,positive,original and effective is not about the cgi neither the budget is creativity
Aug 22 2007,positive,maybe one of the most overrated films ever  if it hadnt been filmed in the woods near my house id probably deduct a star and a half only works if youve ever been in real scary ass woods on the east coast imo
Aug 22 2007,positive,one of the creepiest movies of all time if you let it suck you in
Aug 22 2007,negative,the guys who made this movie must be laughing soooo hard original but boring
Aug 22 2007,negative,i saw this at an art house theater before its national release the line stretched around the block afterward the film a stream of disappointed people filtered into the streets feeling more then a little bit cheated
Aug 22 2007,positive,this moive was sssooo scarybut i loved it
Aug 22 2007,negative,cant believe this is considered a real movie
Aug 22 2007,negative,what a load of old hype
Aug 22 2007,positive,i have probably never seen such a suspenseful movie  i couldnt watch a lot of it and just the sound was scary as all get out  having said that it was a little thin plotwise
Aug 22 2007,negative,any movie that is parodied 8000 times every time kids go into the woods is not highly rated on the list of good movies they did do a good job making the interviews with people look convincing for that 2 stars
Aug 22 2007,negative,taking 3 days to finish a movie just bcoz it was that boring speaks volumes my advise watch it only if  1 all other dvds in the world have suddenly disappeared  2 you have a dvd player in your office and the boss is out of town  and  3 someone pointing a gun to your head is making you see it  on second thoughts ask the guy to go ahead and shoot believe meyou wont regret it
Aug 22 2007,positive,i saw this in the theater it was so quiet and i was so freaked that when a guy sneezed i screamed
Aug 22 2007,positive,when i saw this the mood was rather broken by some foreign students giggling all the way through the last half  the final image was nonetheless creepy so i can only imagine what it must have been like under better circumstances
Aug 22 2007,negative,good acting way too long of a movie  sweet but confusing ending
Aug 22 2007,negative,i want this hour and 27 minutes of my life back
Aug 22 2007,positive,dude watch this movie alone in the dark at midnight on a windy night in a creeky house then tell me this isnt freaky stuff
Aug 22 2007,positive,i managed not to puke and i enjoyed the movie
Aug 22 2007,positive,classic this truly original film has been thought overrated by many but in truth it is a masterpeice the true meaning of horror not the gore or shock factor here but this film will have you frightened because of its realism the most tense film you will ever see you have been warned
Aug 22 2007,positive,independent movies are finally given the resurrection weve been into blcraving in the form of daniel myrick  eduardo sanchezs classic documentary style chiller the blair witch project not since wes cravens indie classic a nightmare on elm street has a movie of such imagination and creative genius gripped so many      the originality of writerdirectors myrick and sanchezs juicy tale about three students who venture into some woods near burkittsville maryland to make a student documentary has helped blair witch become the most successful lowbudget picture of all time surpassing john carpenters brilliant halloween      student filmmakers heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams take a 16mm camera and some sound equipment ack hills forest to investigate the myth of the blair witch which dates back some two hundred years gruesome mysterious deaths are blamed on the blair witch myth but as yet nothing is proved      one year on the footage from their documentary is found       this is an absolutely brilliant and clever piece of filmmaking the nighttime sequences mainly provide a blank screen to the audience leaving just the audio to move things along which it manages with an eerie effectiveness the winning factor here is myrick and sanchezs reluctance to show you the witch everything is left to the imagination providing the same winning formula which made the first hour or so of jaws so effective      the ground shots as the cameraman flees from whatever it is hes fleeing from is a very imaginative way of incorporating a documentary feel to the film i found myself inching my head upwards trying to get the actor to hopefully show us something but he never does amateur video images sometimes used in news reports have the same effect when something unexpected happens the cameraman can sometimes lose control of his or her camera therefore preventing you from seeing footage you might want to see blair witch has that same effect      since the blair witch project many films have tried in vain to capture the same appeal that this film has in abundance but for me none have come close its not the scariest film of all time which might explain why there are a lot of people out there who were not sold by its genius one might suggest watching it with an open mind hopefully you will not be disappointed    quite simply a masterpiece of inventive filmmaking
Aug 22 2007,negative,this was the worst film i have seen in a long time what an overhyped bunch of nonsense
Aug 22 2007,negative,horribly overrated the build up and marketing was excellent and more viable  watchable than the end product it was not scary in the slightest and the acting just grated every nerve in my body josh josh oh get stuffed
Aug 22 2007,negative,nauseating but a creative premise
Aug 22 2007,negative,as good as everyone said it wasno waitdid everyone say the blair witch project is worse than the movie i accidentally made when i left my video camera recording and put it back in the camera bag so all you saw for 2 hours was the inside of the camera bag and all you heard were the muffled sounds of tom  jerry reruns  oh they didnt well everyone should have said that
Aug 22 2007,positive,one of a few scary films thats actually scary
Aug 22 2007,negative,couldnt watch it all not interested
Aug 22 2007,positive,the best marketed movie of all time

Aug 22 2007,positive,i loved this when it came out still do too bad the hype turned sour after a while the sequel possibly didnt help
Aug 22 2007,positive,another one i thought id hate i loathe horror flicks but it was great
Aug 22 2007,positive,all horror filmmakers should watch this movie for a number of reasons 1 it shows that horror can be created by elements other than sight you can terrify an audience in ways besides just something jumping out of the shadows 2 it allows the audience to have imagination part of the way it is filmed is that you feel like youre holding the camera experiencing this terror with the actors and 3 it does not try to be extravagant on the contrary it is so simple it doesnt need some extensive plot twist or awesome graphics just a handheld camera in the middle of the woods   now i noticed people call it stupid and bad but i notice none of those reviews give a reason for it i think part of that is spoiler that you never see the witch most people expect that by the end you will see the witch so when you dont a lot of people would be disappointed but all i have to say is put yourself in their shoes for anyone whos ever been in the woods at night you know how terrifying it can be like the descent this movie puts people in a very scary setting and makes it even scarier
Aug 21 2007,positive,its actually pretty scary and done well
Aug 21 2007,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen waste of film and way overhyped

Aug 21 2007,positive,one of my favorite horror movies ever this movie creeps me out not matter how many times i watch it the use of ambient sound is phenominal and increases the intensity of the film

Aug 20 2007,negative,it was gay a shakey home video camera and some dark woods
Aug 20 2007,positive,i loved it but i saw it in the theater when it came out and it was novel and terrifying  but you need an imagination  and once you have seen it it has no rewatch potential  its like peter griffin said on family guy nothings happening nothings happening something about a map nothings happening
Aug 20 2007,positive,ive only seen it once not watchin it again

Aug 20 2007,negative,it was a horrible movie not because it was scary but because it wasnt scary at all in fact it wasnt funny scary good or well made
Aug 20 2007,positive,it was a cool movie at the time it came out when you didnt know whether it was real or not but since it wasnt and you dont see anything and nothing happens it sucks  i thought i was going to have a seizure from all the moving around with the cameras  still i got to give props for creativity

Aug 19 2007,positive,i dont care what anyone else thought  it scared me  little kids giggling and pushing the tent at night  thats creepy  the girl was annoying thinking she knew where she was going all the time when it was clear she had no idea  they kept changing direction rather than following the river  some of the things in the film were so silly that you just wanted to scream at them for being complete asses  id never watch it alone  turn the lights off in the living room and its like youre out there with them
Aug 19 2007,positive,haha this movies soo fucking funny

Aug 19 2007,negative,very creative with a typical camera but too much of a headache
Aug 19 2007,negative,overhyped the concept and buildup was great the movie was a huge letdown the terrible acting detracts from any suspense that could have been created the end was not scary in the slightest ive never been a fan

Aug 19 2007,positive,somewhat overated not quite as scary as it was meant to be but a fantastic publicity campaign
Aug 19 2007,positive,isnt it great what you can do with three desperate young actors and a couple of camcorders  at times it drags a little but on the whole its a different slant on the horror film which spawned several imitators
Aug 19 2007,negative,unique edge to a horror movie but somewhat boring
Aug 18 2007,negative,cheezey  the woods realy scare menot
Aug 18 2007,positive,it was fun while it lasted  especially how people thought it was real
Aug 18 2007,negative,people doing nothing for 2 hours hell yeah
Aug 18 2007,positive,i cant believe i left my dying mothers side to catch a matinee of this still kinda fun in that gratuitously stupid kind of way
Aug 18 2007,positive,saw this when it first came out before there was any hype that made it interestingi think the hype killed it
Aug 18 2007,positive,had me laughing the whole way through
Aug 18 2007,positive,i used to like to camp
Aug 18 2007,positive,its almost ten years after this came out and i just watched this for the first time the hype was huge from what i can remember as a middle schooler all my friends saw it but i didnt get to well fuck you kids i dont remember i finally watched it    i have to say that not knowing the history of this film at all i actually believed it to be real footage but then common sense told me that there is no way it was real but it definitely succeeded in making you think it is     i am not one for scary movies because most of the time i think they are shit but watching this one was fucking scary i watched it at night and the sound effects and the realism of it all just scared the shit out of me props to these actors in this like big time    there were only a few parts of this film that got boring mainly the beginning before they went into the woods and when she found that bundle of sticks with joshs bloody something wrapped in it i lost a little believability     overall you have to watch this in the dead quiet of night you have to clearly be able to hear all the sounds i did not see this in theaters because i was too young at the time but i can imagine that it would not have scared me that much while watching it with so many other people in the same place    watch it in th dark alone and it will kick your ass
Aug 18 2007,negative,some people swear by it i swear at it
Aug 18 2007,negative,oh godlmao i give half a star for their effort

Aug 18 2007,positive,intenseput your self there and it is scary
Aug 18 2007,positive,lots of profanity almost unnecessarybut this movie scared the bodily fluids out of me
Aug 18 2007,positive,wierd movie very interesting idea for a film and thus creative camera angles and filters but qutie wierd ill give it a decent rating for being remotely believable freaking people out and some badass artistic direction
Aug 18 2007,positive,i mean its scary and stuff with all the less is more or in this case none is more thing what i was kind of disappointed in was there was nothing to be scared of sure theres a few gimmicks here and there and the idea is to use your imagination but in the end all i think of is the fact that josh and mike just pulled a long prank on heather this whole time    do yourself a favor and watch how it should have ended on youtube and youll see what i was disappointed in with the movie
Aug 18 2007,positive,decent effort for a zero dollar budget film not a true story heather donahue was a presenter at the 1999 mtv music awards
Aug 18 2007,negative,this is the first and only time i can remember having to vomit from motion sickness wout ever moving
Aug 18 2007,positive,this is great on the big screen the first time  i remember seeing it in the theatre when it first came out  then they ruined the whole effect by coming out that it was a hoax  what a stupid business move
Aug 18 2007,negative,i saw this one after all the hype so that may be part of my opinion  but i thought it was more humorous than it was scary
Aug 18 2007,positive,best marketed movie of all time
Aug 18 2007,negative,more nauseating due to the amateurish camera work than scary
Aug 18 2007,positive,i think i am the only one if the world who likes this movie
Aug 18 2007,positive,really good actually genuinely creepy the second was good as well
Aug 18 2007,negative,i sort of liked it the first time i saw it  the second time i tried to watch it was about as entertaining as punching myself in the face for an hour and a half
Aug 18 2007,neutral,nothings happeningnothings happeningsomething about a mapnothings happeningand the movies over everyone looks pissed i think that description does this film justice
Aug 18 2007,negative,horrible horrible horrible movie

Aug 18 2007,neutral,pretty boring scaryish
Aug 18 2007,neutral,the last time i watched this movie was in 8th grade and at that point in time i was thoroughly horrified by it and vowed to never go camping again now at the tender age of 20 this movie seems nothing more a cheap gimmick with only small tastes of any kind of creepiness if i wanted to watch people senselessly argue and generally behave like a bunch of drunken monkeys i would crack open a beer sit down and observe anyone hanging out in the pike house which would save me the trouble of actually having to put this lame ass film into my dvd player
Aug 18 2007,positive,i thought it was really good and inventive especially enjoyable in the dark cinema with surround sound
Aug 18 2007,negative,dont get it  watched it after numerous people say it is the first truly scary movie  not so  no plot no acting nothing

Aug 17 2007,negative,kreepy but i know it wasnt real haha
Aug 17 2007,positive,how to turn 150k into 248m borrow a camera a few mates and 2 acres of wood unfortunatly heather donahue totally destroys the illusion by acting for the full 1hr 27min she is annoying from the word go anyone who claims this did not scare them is lying
Aug 17 2007,positive,this movie made me actually throw up i had to leave the theatre to go hurl in the bathroom spent most of the movie turned away with my eyes closed it sounded good though this unfortunately started the whole shaky camera style of moviemaking to the disappointment of those of us who are motionchallenged
Aug 17 2007,positive,omg really really really scary
Aug 17 2007,negative,ugh  i dont think any of these actors got any more jobs after this  if they did then they should burn this movie and forget that it was ever made

Aug 17 2007,positive,innovativemovies really great if you actually believe its true
Aug 17 2007,positive,good suspensful thriller while not showing that bitch
Aug 17 2007,positive,so what if theres a gimmick all you need is a decent imagination to help along all that could be and youll scare yourself stupid with the possibilities a different and great kind of fun if its novelty then it takes full advantage of it
Aug 17 2007,positive,this was a pretty good idea for a movie very scary the first time around when i was in like 6th grade but now it doesnt have the same effect
Aug 16 2007,positive,this one movie that scared the crap out of me

Aug 16 2007,positive,ya know this was scary when it first came out
Aug 16 2007,positive,this is by far the scariest movie that ive ever seen i think that the fact that they shot it with a cheap hand held camera makes it that much more realistic and frightening
Aug 16 2007,negative,so the only reason this rates a 2  despite leaving the theatre with motion sickness  is that i still am freaked out by the last scene
Aug 16 2007,positive,a genus film by film students

Aug 16 2007,positive,great horror back to the roots the mind is stronger
Aug 16 2007,positive,its amazing how much this move makes you scared considering theres nothing really there  its like when one actually goes camping all there is to be scared about is whats generated in your mind  nothing more but god damn does it work
Aug 16 2007,positive,original interesting sincerely scary
Aug 16 2007,positive,only good the first time you watch it  it loses its affect after that

Aug 16 2007,positive,best movie i was in high school in theatersso scary
Aug 16 2007,negative,ridiculous hype when it came out but wasnt particularly clever relying on dodgy motion sickness inducing handheld camera footage creepy but not for any good reason
Aug 16 2007,negative,not a really goood movie
Aug 16 2007,positive,this was okbut the sequel book of shadows was it was total garbage
Aug 16 2007,positive,the ending is what i enjoyed the most  not because it was over but because it was the scariest moment in the film
Aug 16 2007,negative,couldnt be more awful than it is i didnt find it terrifying neither interesting
Aug 16 2007,negative,best part was watching people running for the exit to puke or ask for their money back  props to the creators though

Aug 15 2007,positive,i liked this movie and all the hype leading up to it  im one of the few that wasnt disappointed by the movie itself  at least it was something new
Aug 15 2007,positive,the movie itself is neither that horrifying nor that interesting  the hype surrounding people throwing up was probably due more to motion sickness from the shaky camera work but the final image is so disturbing and had me checking out rooms that i entered for a week afterwards  for that alone its worth seeing
Aug 15 2007,positive,scary they raked in  for this low budget film
Aug 15 2007,positive,now this was scary a little too much handheld camera chaos but the subtle creepiness was powerful

Aug 15 2007,negative,a rare occurance when a films hype is better than the actual film a clever idea and yes original but like drunken sexa good idea disappointing overall
Aug 15 2007,positive,was crazy when i first saw it  if you can get over the way its shot its a cool psycological thriller
Aug 15 2007,positive,i liked that fact that these guys took a smallbudget movie big proving you dont have to spend 400m to make a decent movie
Aug 15 2007,positive,absolutely amazing one of the best movies of all time

Aug 15 2007,negative,so disappointed when i got round to see it just utter crap and too much runny noses
Aug 15 2007,positive,slow at first great at the end the way this film was made was absolute genius
Aug 15 2007,positive,not scary i dont know what people are on about this movie is good but definately should be put in the teen category
Aug 15 2007,positive,quite scary at the time ground breaking
Aug 15 2007,positive,man this movie is dumber than the rock stacks in the film but was cleverly marketed to fool thousands of people into believeing it was real i remember a mockumentary even being played on tv that people thought was real this movie freaked out alot of people
Aug 15 2007,neutral,kinda creepy in a it feels kinda real way but the ending was underwhelming and left me blank
Aug 14 2007,positive,original wellacted and terrifying this film doesnt deserve the negative reviews it continually garners  the concept is simple and repeatedly executed with brilliance the documentary the fictional filmmakers are producing is just the sort of thing that would interest college students enough to warrant action and the interviews with locals about the fake legend which is in turns original and also a composite of similar haunting tales comes off effortlessly    when the makers descend into the woods the line between reality and fiction is successfully blurred clearly they know theyre making a fictional film but the sense of true terror is retained in their reactions to various sound effects and aberrant occurrences though it may not be looked upon as a miracle of editing the act of taking what must have been hours of raw footage and distilling it into a film with such horror and occasional humor must have been a herculean task yet it is pulled off with effortless aplomb    what makes it all work even better is the slow but sure way the tension mounts and the restraint shown even in the showy climax if your heart isnt pounding as they make that last run through the forest youve either been turned off by your motion sickness or you havent gotten into it likely because the idea of being alone in a forest isnt your idea of scary the less is more approach really works here because nothing would turn you off more than seeing some idiot in a witch costume right before the camera turns off moments where the tent is shaken and a petrified heather donahue looks off to the side and screams what the fuck is that strike into the elemental core of horror this plays directly into the makers trump card that you ultimately do not get a definite answer as to what happened was it an elaborate hoax is some psycho living in the forest is the witch real     in any case it doesnt matter despite scores of imitators the final product remains untouched as a classic horror film
Aug 14 2007,positive,i saw this film in a discount theatre which sat about 20 so it was perfect and believable i found it terrifying once i allowed myself to get into it seriously dont watch the second one the first one is a musthave for any horror collection
Aug 14 2007,neutral,hahaha i laughed so hard at this movie
Aug 14 2007,positive,that shit scared me when it first came out to quite honest
Aug 14 2007,positive,this isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be its an original concept i loved the filming of thisdefinitely not made for the general population

Aug 14 2007,negative,not fuckin scary u deuche bags
Aug 14 2007,negative,before i saw this movie i was so excited  but afther taht please give me  my break
Aug 14 2007,negative,were a bunch of kids in the forest with a camera oh shit i think a lot of teenagers will associate with this and buy into this great con of a movie  it feels like anal rape when youre done
Aug 14 2007,negative,watch it because it started the whole jiggly camera action scene revolution but dont ever watch it again
Aug 14 2007,positive,yes there was hype to tell the truth it did frighten the heck out of me so something had to be right there
Aug 14 2007,positive,better than all the people who make fun of it would make you think

Aug 14 2007,positive,the camera work made me dizzy
Aug 14 2007,positive,this was intense creepy
Aug 14 2007,positive,the scariest movie ive seen since those of the eighties actors are so inexperienced that they come across so convincingly  the only reason i havent given it 5 stars is that im not sure what the impact would be watching it a second time  maybe i should just try it hah
Aug 14 2007,positive,never saw te whole thing
Aug 14 2007,positive,its been a whilei forget
Aug 14 2007,positive,cant believe its a college made movie i almost pissed myself during it
Aug 14 2007,negative,i like it the first few times i watched it but now i realize how bad of a movie it really is

Aug 14 2007,positive,awesome shock value
Aug 13 2007,negative,was this suppose to be scary was this suppose to be good god i wanted to stab my eyes out watching this
Aug 13 2007,neutral,ew the part where the girl needed a tissue really really bad grossed me out she was all boogering in the camera and it totally killed the mood of the movie i wasnt even scared of it at all not that great
Aug 13 2007,positive,if you didnt like this film you either heard too much hype before seeing it or dont have an imagination 
Aug 13 2007,positive,this was like one of the scariest movies ever i didnt even make it all the way through it
Aug 13 2007,positive,pretty creepy i give them credit for originality
Aug 13 2007,positive,this film shouldve gotten an academy award for marketing but it still wasnt too bad
Aug 13 2007,negative,aaarrgghhh possible the most of hyped piece of crap not scary just ppl running in the woods steaming oh my god its not scary
Aug 13 2007,positive,i think this film is truly brilliant gripping and creative as all get out it really did change the way movies were made afterwards its not technically the first to try this approach but it is without a doubt the most successful and the best this whole new idea of raw cinema from saw to collateral and the list goes on owes worlds to this movie
Aug 13 2007,neutral,pretty gash really for saying it was billed as the scariest film of all time i wasnt impressed the filmmakers had a good idea and the plot built well but in the end it built up and up and up and up and then a rubbish ending gash the biggest anticlimax ever what makes it worse is that yanks think it was a true story muppets

Aug 13 2007,positive,a truly underrated horror flick a study showed that 40 of americans actually believe that the footage in the movie was real shows how bright americans are then again it shows how effective this movie is at making you believe in the witch no gore in the movie you never see the witch either its all psychological because the writers recognized that the scariest thing is the human mind the most psychologically scary movie of all time watch it alone at night without disturbances
Aug 13 2007,negative,i have no idea why this was such a huge movie to be honest with you

Aug 12 2007,negative,saw a long time ago decent idea
Aug 12 2007,negative,biggest let down of 1999
Aug 12 2007,negative,the only thing scary about this film was the fact i actually paid money to see it after 30mins the entire cinema audience had given up and were basically talking amongst themselves the characters were so stupid they deserved to die
Aug 12 2007,positive,what do you got with 3 filmmakers 2 cameras and haunted woods one of the scariest movies ever made in years this is supernatural snuff to the fullest
Aug 12 2007,positive,this movie scares me
Aug 12 2007,positive,either hate this movie or it scares your balls off the responses that this movie has taken only proves how peoples fears are stimulated differently so if you have a crazy imagination or fear the unknown this movie scares the f out of you but if the unknown doesnt creep you out then this movie will be painful to sit through i personally though it to be quite intense and freaky

Aug 12 2007,positive,i think the blair witch project is brilliantly done its scary without really showing anything  no blood no violence and no witch they manage to create a creepy atmosphere with simple suggestion and off camera sounds
Aug 12 2007,negative,aside from the last three minutes which reminded me of an experience i actually had inane whiny crap im amaxed my girlfriend at the time didnt dump me for having taken her to see it

Aug 12 2007,positive,everyone always poo poos all over this film  but i remember when this first came out that i thought it was based on a true story or something  in fact i didnt know it was fake until i overheard someone discussing it being a publicity stunt in line at the theater  it was a bit disappointing but i still thought the movie was creepy  its a bit boring at times but the end is freaky
Aug 12 2007,neutral,total shitfest good though
Aug 12 2007,positive,well generally horror doesnt inflict any feelings inside me but well yeh in a way this one was a good way to create some minute changes
Aug 12 2007,negative,the trailer park boys blair pimp project was better

Aug 12 2007,negative,great ideathats it

Aug 12 2007,positive,i saw this without hearing a single thing about the movie on opening day and i thought it was a solid study on the origins of myth despite much of the public panning it after the fact everyone in my theatre was so quiet you could hear every little sound detail in the movie tell me how many times that happens when you go out and see a movie
Aug 12 2007,negative,i fell asleep during this  i dont get it  not scary and the filming even though i know its supposed to be a documentary kinda made me feel nauseous
Aug 11 2007,positive,the first movie to actually scare me in a very long time though the story had a few plotholes in it and the characters made some dumb choices it was beautifully acted you really felt like these kids were lost in the woods and being hunted and that made it extra creepy
Aug 11 2007,negative,dumbest shit ever not scarry i dont see how anybody would be
Aug 11 2007,positive,this movie still gives me chicken skin
Aug 11 2007,positive,this movie has been spoofed a million times but its still scary stuff
Aug 11 2007,negative,stupid it made me sick
Aug 11 2007,positive,great movie everyone said that this movie sucked but it was what they didnt notice about it that made it seem like crap to them the whole point of the scare factor was that you never saw the witch its like the haunting you never saw the ghosts which made it so creepy but yes the script was pretty stupid at times but ive heard worse but this still sent shivers up and down my spine and if you want an extra scare watch it in the pitch black then you get real jumpy

Aug 11 2007,negative,wprst let down i ever had movie styley i fell for the whole advertising internet thingy and the book but the film was shite only thing that scared me in this film was that i was worried i might spue with all the nutty camera work
Aug 11 2007,positive,this movie actually kept my attention because i wanted to see what was next
Aug 11 2007,positive,i still like this movie so sue me
Aug 11 2007,positive,i only rate this movie so highly because of its ingenious marketing strategy and its ability to still scare you with only real world sounds and real world reactions  no jumpy gimmicks or fake gore  brilliant from a film study perspective
Aug 11 2007,positive,loved it i think the only way you dont like this is if you have either a no imagination or b have never spent much time in the woods great premise unique film style too bad they had to make a sequel
Aug 11 2007,neutral,was not really interested
Aug 11 2007,positive,after about 20 mins in i thought this was going to be rubbish but since there was nothing else on i decided to stick through and i enjoyed it freaky
Aug 11 2007,neutral,i remember how scared we all were and then it was just silly

Aug 11 2007,neutral,get a fucking camera man
Aug 11 2007,positive,this is the ultimaye love it or hate it movie  yep i loved it the amateur camera style works the characters are a bit annoying but that sums up american teens and the ending just blew me away 
Aug 11 2007,negative,hate hate hate it
Aug 10 2007,neutral,some creepy parts overrated in general
Aug 10 2007,negative,maybe this wouldve been scarier if i watched it back when people thought it was real

Aug 10 2007,negative,not all it was cracked up to be
Aug 10 2007,positive,the last shot in the movie actually gave me chills up my spine
Aug 10 2007,positive,you have to give this film credit filmed with little more than a camcorder it did manage to evoke some tension but didnt quite live up to the hype very good effort and you just have to try and appreciate it for what it is rather than what it is not
Aug 10 2007,positive,so confusing and retarded
Aug 10 2007,positive,this was only because i saw it while i was living at home at my parents house in the woods

Aug 10 2007,negative,i bought this for six bucks instead of renting it i want my six bucks back
Aug 10 2007,positive,interesting small budget film made into a huge success  perhaps not all of the computer graphics are needed when an original concept can be well presented
Aug 10 2007,negative,rated as a brilliant film at the time saw it not impressed did they try a follow up please tell me they didnt
Aug 10 2007,positive,first movie ive ever seen someone get motion sick from  drinking in the truck on the way to fredericton was worth it kris  greg you know

Aug 10 2007,positive,i saw this before it came out that it was fake and it was actually pretty unsettlingbut still just 2 guys and a shirley manson wannabe bitchin in the woods
Aug 10 2007,positive,creepy as hell  as long as you can take the shaky filming
Aug 10 2007,negative,it is an absolute mystery to me why this garbage ever did so well thought it was impossible to make a worse film then i saw the village
Aug 10 2007,positive,still makes me think twice about going outside at night
Aug 10 2007,neutral,honestly i didnt think it was that bad  sure nothing really happens and its low quality filming but it was a nice premise and i do like the ending

Aug 10 2007,negative,terrible concept terrible execution terrible overhype
Aug 10 2007,negative,ugh so bad so very very bad there was nothing to it im sorry but the hype was just that hype
Aug 10 2007,positive,holy shit i thought this film was scary  i saw this movie at a cinema in a strange part of new york that i hadnt been to before and it was the late showing meaning i was going to leave the cinema at close to midnight  i think a lot of people who have since seen it on dvd dont really get the jist of it it really needs to be seen on a full screen to capture the sensory perception of being surrounded in a forest by unknown forces seeing as this was low budgetlow sound it really does create a sense of supernatural mystery and impending doom from the stacks of stones to the wicker man type hanging symbols this film is extremely clever in creating a mood  as someone else has since said it is terrifying in its simplicity  do yourself a favour if you are gonna see it at home dont bother if you dont have a hefty surround sound system and hige screen  and do it late at night
Aug 10 2007,positive,i dont know about you all but i was so freaked out great
Aug 10 2007,positive,there supposed to be film students but even when nothing is happening they cant keep their camera straight

Aug 9 2007,positive,yeah i know i actually got into this movie the first time i watched it though and i thoroughly enjoyed it acting was questionable but that aside it was creepy as hell full of imagination and terribly scary at the end also leaving you to think i watched it again recently and couldnt get into it but i suppose it makes for a quality cultevent film
Aug 9 2007,negative,more like the blair stupid project why did this get made  it was terrible  i want that hour and a half back
Aug 9 2007,negative,never understood this crap
Aug 9 2007,positive,revolutionary at the time but has aged poorly

Aug 9 2007,negative,my god i thought this could be a good movie but it turned out to be crap you never get to see anything and it they end without having accomplished anything at all
Aug 9 2007,negative,this movie was the biggest piece of shit i have ever seen the most anyone jumped while we were watching it was at the end when we turned it off and the white noise was blaringly loud
Aug 9 2007,positive,terrifying in its simplicity lulls you into a false sense of security thinking its dodgy but then the ending is so incredibly scary

Aug 9 2007,negative,i went that 95 minutes of my life back
Aug 9 2007,positive,annoying at times because you literally cant see anything but still an original and inventive way to deliver a horror film
Aug 9 2007,negative,i got up to get soup and totally missed the ending  the blair thumb is great though
Aug 9 2007,positive,it was a good movie and i love the way they made itthe actors in this movie actually thought  they were doing a  documentary so all the terror is real the crew basically scared the shit out of them to make it believable i thought this movie was good but i expected more at the endbut still worth watching
Aug 9 2007,positive,pretty good a solid little indie flick
Aug 9 2007,negative,you want me to rate this

Aug 9 2007,positive,there may not be much to it but it is terrifying
Aug 9 2007,positive,very interesting and original concept  the last ten minutes were terrifying  the rest of the film not so much
Aug 9 2007,negative,didnt know how to give it no stars seen it didnt believe the hype it is awful
Aug 9 2007,positive,ah a v difficult one to rate  had v high expectations as it was pushed so strongly in advance so perhaps some disappointment was inevitable a bit long but it was genuinely scary  strangely enough ive never felt the urge to see it again

Aug 9 2007,negative,im still furious about the time i wasted in the cinema suffering through this

Aug 9 2007,positive,i liked this movie i think only people who have lived out by the woods can truly apprecite it loldidnt care too much for the 2nd one though
Aug 9 2007,positive,a muchneeded breath of fresh air in the horror genre it was truly scary in a subdued sort of way and relied on the contagious fear of the actors to seep through to the audience
Aug 9 2007,negative,im not even sure this is so bad its good
Aug 9 2007,positive,this movie was highly over rated
Aug 9 2007,positive,a gimmick worthless upon repeat viewings
Aug 9 2007,positive,a way cool style of filmmaking you actually feel as if you are watching three college students experience what they are experiencing in the movie the acting was greatthey were completely convincing me that they were as terrified as they were supposed to be it ended too abruptly for me but it did add to the suspense and terror a definite plus
Aug 9 2007,positive,well i liked it even if noone else did  good plot structure and well made imho
Aug 9 2007,positive,okay it didnt help that it was promoted as being scarier than the exorcist its not the exorcist isnt really that scary either its creepy rather than allout terrifying the breakdown of the friends relationship is what really gets under the skin and the last 15 minutes are genuinely scary
Aug 9 2007,positive,creppiest movie of the 20th century
Aug 9 2007,positive,went to bed shaking and would go into a corner for my life for two days after seeing it
Aug 9 2007,negative,what was all the fuss about

Aug 7 2007,positive,i think i am the only person alive that this movie scared the crap out of
Aug 7 2007,positive,this is a pretty effective and rather influential film  plus if youve ever been hiking you have no empathy for the protagonists whatsoever bc they are astonishingly stupid
Aug 7 2007,positive,hahai was actually really scared with i watched this for the first time
Aug 7 2007,negative,it might be me but i just thought this was boring confusing and not at all scary  now the shaky camera and such was novel at first but not worth seeing just the cinematography
Aug 7 2007,positive,nuthin better than people running around screaming in the dark woods
Aug 7 2007,negative,remember when you had that friend who swore this was real that friend was full of shit just like this movie

Aug 7 2007,negative,people fight over this movie you can get scared but you can also just laugh out loud
Aug 7 2007,negative,a full length movie that would have accomplished the same effect as a short
Aug 7 2007,negative,a great example of marketers successfully selling a crappy movie to a country full of commercial addicts i fell for the ploy and paid for it with motion sickness
Aug 7 2007,negative,i dont know what all the commotion was about with this one but i thought it blew
Aug 7 2007,positive,bahhh  not extremely scary but enough to keep me satisfied and coming back i liked it

Aug 7 2007,positive,i liked it make you sick sit farther back  awesome combo of improvisational acting and scripted situations
Aug 7 2007,negative,an original ideabut thats where the positives for this film end every aspect about this film is annoying to the extreme from the shakey hand held camera to the awful whiney acting to the vile looking characters and the plot what utter unexplained nonsense there are so many things during the film that make you want to tear your hair out or shoot the characters dead yourself from what i can remember here are a few    firstly when going to camp in the knowingly haunted woods anyone with an iota of intelligence will go along slightly better prepared than those stupid kids fully charged mobile phones all round for a start then the rest compasses flares walkietalkies etc and of course weaponry dont forget they have decided to go in and take on the mighty blair witch so wouldnt it be wise to go in armed i mean just in case id have been armed to the teeth im talking guns throwing knives crossbows hand grenades grenade launchers tear gas smoke canisters night vision if blair witch jumps on my tent in the middle of the night he or she will find a round of clips in their torso in no time to go in there with little more than a puny swiss army knife isnt gonna help your cause when you find the blair witch is it doh     in the final scenes at the end they shouldve been spraying that house with bullets as they approached not pussyfooting around hence they fully deserve to get hung drawn and quartered by blair    secondly they shouldnt even have been lost in the first place  they couldve had a handheld satnav okay maybe mass market gps systems werent available at the time this film was set buthow about at least an uptodate map and an electronic compass  personally id be wearing a breitling emergency homing beacon watch so if all else fails having gone round in circles continuously for a couple of days id pull a switch and rescue helicopters will be landing next to me in no time     i know its intentionally made not to look like a film but in all fairness were the ones who had to sit through an hour and a half of tantalising viewing agony having given in to the hype at the time    god i hate this film

Aug 7 2007,negative,serious waste of film

Aug 6 2007,positive,i dont believe tit is real though
Aug 6 2007,positive,after 8 years i still hadnt seen this movie and i just had to i was really surprised you dont ever actually see the witch but the movie still keeps you on edge especially at the end i really felt connected in a sense of urgency with the characters when they started getting lost in a way no movie has ever done  maybe because of the home video feel to it
Aug 6 2007,negative,the most overhyped piece of trash that i ever spent 10 dollars on at the theaters
Aug 6 2007,negative,the three students go missing without a trace unfortunatly the video footage doesnt
Aug 6 2007,positive,interesting but too much screaming

Aug 5 2007,positive,anyone for camping in the back woods the last scene still freaks me out
Aug 5 2007,neutral,great premise but hoaxed out
Aug 5 2007,positive,this movie didnt scare  me but i can see why it scares some other than that i thought it was fantastic and unique because of the way it was shot and the plotline
Aug 5 2007,negative,the only project here is to burn all copies of this garbage
Aug 5 2007,negative,i just cant take this seriously
Aug 5 2007,positive,gets an undeserved bad rap from too many people a brilliant use of the only two cameras and the fact you never actually see anything which brings back the classic horror story best runny nose ever
Aug 5 2007,negative,wtf was the hype about this for
Aug 5 2007,negative,this movie has a permanent spot in my top 5 movies that should never have been made as well as my id rather shove a fork into my thigh list earning it hall of fame status in my list of shitty movies do yourself a favor dont watch this movie it is nearly 2 hours you will never ever ever get back
Aug 5 2007,negative,so bad not scary not funny im not even sure why people liked it
Aug 5 2007,positive,i thought it was scary as fuck
Aug 5 2007,negative,the person who sat next to me puked while watching  everyone in my party myself included was also similarly nauseous  its a neat idea but doesnt work  the only really scary part was at the end    if not for the vomitinducing aspect of it it wouldnt be all bad but unfortunately it does make you puke so id stay away and go watch other perfectly fine horror movies

Aug 5 2007,positive,a completely different take on movie making  brilliant
Aug 5 2007,positive,i remember when this movie first came out and everyone loved it and thought it was real i thought it was ok but not the best horror movie i have seen it took awhile before anything actually happened and when it did it wasnt that scary  in the end the female character was really annoying but it was an ok movie dont think i would buy it tho
Aug 5 2007,positive,this movie was crazy
Aug 5 2007,negative,the makers of this film decided to go somewhere new do something that nobody else had tried before after seeing this movie can you really blame everybody else for staying away from it how can a movie where nothing happens be so popular

Aug 4 2007,negative,this was like foreplay without the action to finish it offgay
Aug 4 2007,negative,not scary boring sceaming and screaming becomes too much to stand
Aug 4 2007,positive,actually pretty good for a horror movie i dont like many and this one does it right you can say what you want about the shaky cam but it really adds to the realness of the film
Aug 4 2007,positive,hmmtheres no denying the impact this movie had at the time but im afraid it just didnt really do it for me i appreciated the techniques involved although i did feel that some of the socalled innovative techniques were just an excuse for downright laziness lets not forget that this sort of technique has been done before in movies such as cannibal holocaust despite many people thinking that this movie was the first of its kind works better in cinemas i feel this movie
Aug 4 2007,positive,pretty well thought out movie
Aug 4 2007,positive,i know alot of people hate this movie but i liked it alot it was more believable and felt more real than alot of other movies

Aug 4 2007,negative,ive been more scared in my own house
Aug 3 2007,negative,the only thing this movie accomplished was making me want to hurl up my popcorn giving the camera to a monkey a film does not make
Aug 3 2007,positive,pretty cool but if they were really desperate they would have swam across the river but what i find awesome about this film is alls they did was film a camping trip and made it disturbing
Aug 3 2007,negative,i watched this movie when it came out when i was a kid and it didnt scare me then and it certinly doesnt now the hype though was an amazing piece of marketing but marking god willing still has nothing to do with a movie being good or not
Aug 3 2007,positive,it wasnt the scariet movie ive ever seen but it does convey the terror of being alone in the woods and then finding all that crazy stuff overall it was pretty cool

Aug 3 2007,positive,a thoroughly effective horror film that makes great use of its limited budget
Aug 3 2007,negative,stupid movie im ashamed of this movie
Aug 3 2007,positive,for some reason the ending scared the hell out of me i just hate the feeling the one in the corner mustve felt not being able to move or help yet knowing they are next
Aug 3 2007,positive,i saw this film while there was still all the hype and everyone was unsure as to whether it was true or not loved it
Aug 3 2007,negative,i saw this  what happened
Aug 3 2007,negative,not even worth rating lol
Aug 3 2007,positive,creative filmmaking at its best
Aug 3 2007,positive,freaked me out very suspensful especially for someone with an overactive imagination like me
Aug 3 2007,negative,nothing happened 10 grand gets you laid and some money for your heroine habits but it all runs out doesnt it

Aug 3 2007,negative,lamest movie ever stupid pretentious idiots who might have singlehandedly triggered the realitytv craze the bastards only really creepy part was at the end the rest its crap d
Aug 3 2007,negative,the only movie i have ever considered walking out of the theater on
Aug 3 2007,positive,pretty scary great that no effects and the way that it was filmed
Aug 3 2007,positive,i didnt mind the handheld camerawork and the ending was bitchin
Aug 3 2007,negative,thought it was awesome when i thought it was real then i found out it was a load of bull and now i think its a load of crap
Aug 3 2007,negative,i thought this was a steaming pile of poo
Aug 3 2007,positive,i seen it opening night and it scared the shit our of me  but then later found out it was all fake
Aug 3 2007,negative,i so hated this a lot of screaming and running with a camerai think i could have filmed a better college photog101 film
Aug 3 2007,negative,good marketing campaignmovie not so much
Aug 3 2007,positive,this movie is true and so scary
Aug 3 2007,negative,i got a headache while watching this movie
Aug 3 2007,negative,a good idea at the time in hindsight pretty crappy
Aug 3 2007,positive,its one of those films u have to see
Aug 3 2007,negative,it was pretty pointless all the camera movement made me dizzy the story wasnt too bad though
Aug 3 2007,positive,alright seriously  i really liked this movie and it was indeed new for the times
Aug 3 2007,negative,omg what an overrated stupid documentary i liked the second one much better because at least it was obvious it was a movie not some low budget film where you hear fk more than it was said in scarface with al pacino stupid
Aug 3 2007,positive,i know this film gets ribbed alot but seriously if youve never seen it    make sure youre alone turn off the lights listen through your headphones this film is creepy and it was pretty original by using the video cam documentary style
Aug 3 2007,positive,one of the best suspense horror movies best camera angles ever probably not but close
Aug 3 2007,positive,hahaha i accually screamed once during this movie
Aug 3 2007,positive,scared me to death
Aug 3 2007,neutral,it was for the most part boring and the sad part is i got motion sickness and never got to see the endingwhich i heard was the best part
Aug 3 2007,positive,cool scary camcorder approach not really been done since perhaps the new jj abrams project might be a different approach but keep the suspense
Aug 3 2007,positive,i havent seen this since it first came out but i liked it back then
Aug 3 2007,neutral,it was a fun theater experience but it does not hold up at all
Aug 3 2007,negative,all the hype in the world for this tosh boooo
Aug 3 2007,negative,cheap to produce  tons of money
Aug 3 2007,positive,if you let yourself get into the pathos of the movie its a taut tense flick the terror is in the characters reactions not in some cgi monster
Aug 3 2007,negative,the worst film ever made in the whole world ever 
Aug 3 2007,positive,i had to write a paper on this film back in first year film class while it can make you motion sick it is rather tremendous what they were able to do with the camera as being incorporated into the story innovative to say the least it was also filmed on a lowbudget and made millions which is great in itself probably my favourite horror film though it took a while to grow on me lets just forget it had a sequel
Aug 3 2007,positive,the perfect low budget film marketed perfectly and the people involved have gone the way of the dodo they made a straight to video feature which says it alli did like the atmosphere of this film but the characters were cannon fodder i didnt care for them at all but the bit in the tent when you heard the children outside was frightening because they were all dead and that disturbed mei loved the fact that you never saw anything which was the way horror films shoud be the imagination is kingthe concept had been done before in a 70s film so it wasnt completely original but well done the sequel was awful hopefully one day they will make a better one but without the novelty of a dv camera and 35mm or perhaps hidef so you could perhaps see better in the darkoooh it must be donebut have a great script though and i dont want to see the monster either because i have seen the action figure and its shit lol
Aug 3 2007,negative,why the hype i didnt major in theater so i guess i dont get the big picture or the point
Aug 3 2007,negative,you have to give credited that they marketed the movie well but extremely irritating watching it
Aug 3 2007,positive,scares the shit out of me
Aug 3 2007,positive,this film freaks me out a biti love the whole documentry ideastyle
Aug 3 2007,positive,went to the cinema to see this one with alll the hype around it as to whether it was real or not  loved every second not knowing what was going to happen next  felt a bit sick from all the camera motion though 
Aug 3 2007,positive,i was waiting at any moment for something to happen and then it all happened right at the end
Aug 3 2007,negative,the worst supposedly scary movie i have seen
Aug 3 2007,negative,buy me a camcorder and i will make a scarier movie than this this movie is what happens when retards go camping it made me laugh at how our ancestors clawed their way to the top only to be set back about 5000 years by degenerate idiots like the ones portrayed in this movie
Aug 3 2007,negative,this movie made me nauseas literally  i got motion sickness from the way the film was shot and threw up
Aug 3 2007,neutral,this was a freaky movie liked the soundtrack but i was confused through most the film
Aug 2 2007,positive,very scary did u know that it is a true story to
Aug 2 2007,negative,it was all mr monroe  the old man who lived just outside the forest  he was trying to find lost pirate gold or something and dressed up as the blair witch to scare off anyone who might find out what he was up to  and hed have gotten away with it too if it werent for you noobs who actually paid to see this movie  and your dog 
Aug 2 2007,positive,what an absolute disappointment i remember being more terrified of one of the guys hairy nipples than anything else in this movie
Aug 2 2007,positive,so not my type of film i hate scary movies but excellent  a great example of scaring without showing
Aug 2 2007,negative,another steaming pile
Aug 2 2007,positive,though it has received much media derision since it was released i think that this movie is a testament to what can be accomplished with a small budget there are virtually no special effects and practically no script to be quite honest at the same time the paranoia and sense of disorientation that the movie achieves goes beyond what was put into the film financially speaking one cannot argue with profit at the very least however the sequel deserves every negative comment that it earns
Aug 2 2007,negative,really really stupid
Aug 2 2007,positive,after all the jokes and hype i wasnt sure if id like it but i did actually just the right amount of creepy
Aug 2 2007,positive,i dont know if i want to watch it or not me and my friend started to watch it and then her brother woke up and we had to stop
Aug 2 2007,positive,one of the scariest movies ive ever seen a lot of people dont like it because it relies a lot on your imagination
Aug 2 2007,positive,if it wasnt based on a true story it would be incredibly stupid
Aug 2 2007,positive,spooky stuff when ur momz lives close to it like mine
Aug 2 2007,neutral,groundbreaking but ultimately not a great film
Aug 2 2007,negative,we got bored and skipped to the end
Aug 2 2007,negative,ah manone of the most boring films ever made yet there are a handful of unsettling moments and the idea and all that is commendable but what cant be overlooked is how boring the whole thing gets plus for great periods of time there is nothing to seemay aswell be listening to the radio brian in family guy sums it up better than i can  nothings happening nothings happening sumthin about a map nothings happening its over a lot of people looked pd
Aug 2 2007,positive,great movie untill you find out its fake
Aug 2 2007,positive,this movie scared the heck out of me when i saw itonly to find out that it was a total fake but it kept me hooked it was great
Aug 2 2007,positive,this was pretty scary when i was 14 at 2 in the morning all wound up on caffeine
Aug 2 2007,negative,i got motion sick eww
Aug 2 2007,positive,this is what scary movies are all aboutthe fear factor doesnt lie is blood and gore but in playing mind games and this movie does just that it leaves u guessing about what the witch would look likei thought it was pure geniusany day better than movies liek the ring the grudge and the excorsist
Aug 2 2007,positive,i dont care what any of you say this movie was amazing
Aug 2 2007,negative,another buzz movie that i just didnt get   i thought it was lame and boring and its not because i like horror movies with lots of fx and gore i loved the original the haunting which had no special effects no gore and was rated g so there
Aug 1 2007,negative,dumbestass movie ever anyone can make a movie by yelling in the woods into a video camera for two hours fuck that
Aug 1 2007,negative,i was so scared that they were going to get a budget

Aug 1 2007,positive,you either love it or hate it  the ending freaked me out
Aug 1 2007,neutral,ummm had everyone fooled it was a real story then let everyone know it was fake should have just left it thinking everyone really died

Aug 1 2007,negative,well it would have been good if it werent for all the f bombs  sheesh  i dont think they coulda thrown another one in there if they tried
Aug 1 2007,positive,maybe it was over hyped when it came out but at least it tried to do something different in the horror genre instead of being yet another slasher or adapting a movie from japan
Aug 1 2007,positive,it has its charms but its kind of boring
Aug 1 2007,negative,i wanted to make a movie after seeing it
Aug 1 2007,negative,not scary if you have ever spent time in the woodsreccomended for city people

Aug 1 2007,negative,didnt think it was scaryim not the outdoorsy type though but it scared the crap out of dustin
Aug 1 2007,negative,this whole thing is sooooo stupid
Aug 1 2007,positive,its very scary but its hard judgement for me if it sucks or if its great its very real in a sense because its amature footage i was trying to figure out the entire time if it was fake or what
Aug 1 2007,positive,a very basic concept but something that just works so well the acting is very good all round but the gradual build up of atmosphere makes this a classic brilliantly chilling a rare excellent horror film that all must experience if just for the excellent ending alone
Aug 1 2007,negative,you know whats scary not this

Jul 31 2007,positive,scared the bejesus out of me
Jul 31 2007,positive,i know a lot of people had multiple complaints about this movie but i had the advantage of seeing it under the perfect conditions  it was close to winter time the middle of the night in a very rural neighborhood and raining i had the windows open so it was freezing and i heard only rain no traffic no people and i was alone so it was completely uninterrupted it was slow moving in the beginning but ended up freaking me out in the end
Jul 31 2007,positive,it was scary as s when they pretended it was real  you can only see it once though
Jul 31 2007,positive,although it was way overhyped i have to admit it made my spine tingle more than once

Jul 31 2007,positive,awesome the first time i saw it
Jul 31 2007,positive,i admit it  it scared me  what was enven scarier was the face documentary on the scifi channel  these guys did a great job of faking out the nation into thinking this was real  i saw it on the big screen so i am not sure if it will pack to punch after the fact but it is worth a try if you havent seen it
Jul 31 2007,negative,although its impact on cinema was significant for good or bad the movie itself stinks

Jul 31 2007,negative,somewhat innovative but hyped
Jul 31 2007,neutral,wierdly watchable kind of feels like a student film only watched it once and i probably bought into the hype
Jul 31 2007,negative,they lied to millions and made people think there were really people who got killed in the woods by a ghost of a witch that and this movie led to real murders in the woods by some lunatic who takes stuff too serious i give this a 15
Jul 31 2007,negative,i kept thinking and people believed this acting
Jul 31 2007,positive,it builds up a ridiculous amount of suspense with an equally ridiculous lack of a budget youre either going to find the ending chilling or downright anticlimactic and disappointing either way its different and altogether effective
Jul 31 2007,positive,saw it before it got overhyped so it was still very scary at that point
Jul 31 2007,positive,omg this is a really good movie and a really im mean realllllly scary movie

Jul 31 2007,negative,i think i missed the point with this
Jul 31 2007,positive,very controversial for its time the thing i liked most about it was all the tension that was created and sustained throughout without actually seeing a witch or even an old hag apart from that one in the caravan near the start but she was just odd
Jul 30 2007,negative,the last 10min was good
Jul 30 2007,positive,for what it iswhatever
Jul 30 2007,positive,in all seriousness  with no patended film student hyperbole  i think this is the most important american film of the last ten years  message me if you want to know why

Jul 30 2007,negative,enjoyed it greatly screw all the naysayers

Jul 30 2007,positive,great movie even if im in the minority here very original and in my book truly scary
Jul 30 2007,positive,its the kind of movie with a fresh idea that you either love or hate i loved it so bite me
Jul 30 2007,positive,it suffers from extreme backlash now but when it came out everyone was gaga over it  you cant deny that the marketing was genius  the movie on the other hand is very hit or miss
Jul 30 2007,positive,a highly influential and inventive horror film that is the first of the nownumerous found footage films the blair witch is more suspenseful than scary but delivers a convincing sense of fear and dread and a disturbing kicker of an ending
Jul 30 2007,positive,it was a good one  nice creative filmmaking
Jul 30 2007,negative,this movie was lame i couldnt wait for it to end
Jul 30 2007,negative,another movie that wasted my time the guy at the end looks like hes pissin on a wall

Jul 30 2007,positive,good at first but then way too much credit for the filmmakers it was just ok
Jul 30 2007,negative,overhyped piece of trash not scarey in the slightest
Jul 30 2007,negative,i still enjoy this film  it may suck but still the whole thought of a witch living in the woods killing teenagers fascinates me
Jul 30 2007,positive,mm snots attractive
Jul 30 2007,negative,two words fucking overrated
Jul 30 2007,positive,couldnt walk through the park in the dark for ages after seeing this ending always freaks me out
Jul 30 2007,negative,didnt buy into all the hype
Jul 30 2007,negative,we never really saw anything sticks screaming and running it made me naceous watching it because of all the camera motion
Jul 30 2007,negative,totally not cool  the only part i thought was creepy was the very end
Jul 30 2007,positive,everything a good horror movie needed

Jul 30 2007,positive,an excellent psychological descent into terror
Jul 30 2007,positive,good the first time but after that a tad boring
Jul 30 2007,positive,excellent movie it seems so believable that its a documentary and that the whole story line is true
Jul 30 2007,negative,and what was the fuss about
Jul 30 2007,negative,no way near as good as the erotic blair witch project will have to ask scotty where did that end up

Jul 30 2007,positive,scared the fucking shit out of me and i didnt even see it at the movies
Jul 30 2007,positive,you either love it or you hate iti love it
Jul 30 2007,positive,i have to give it 4 stars for what it isa horror flick that has the potential to scare the crap out of you not by using blood guts and gore but by the psychological terror of the unseen  it starts off with realitystyle camera filming with handheld camcorders a spooky story and follows it all the way to the chilling and bizarre conclusion while preying on fear of the woods terror of strange noises in the night etc  its also wellacted by 3 total unknowns  the interviews with locals were also convincingly realistic  the marketing concept for this when it came out was also brilliant  they fooled half the world into thinking it was real  i even thought it was real and still believed it for a long time afterwards  this was before the days of widespread internet usage thoughwhen such stunts could be pulled off more easily  in any case dont watch this before you go camping
Jul 30 2007,positive,high campy and scary

Jul 29 2007,negative,this movie is a lot like  catholicism
Jul 29 2007,neutral,heh  i think you were required to watch this if you werea human being back in 99
Jul 29 2007,negative,that was horriblebut better than the first one though
Jul 29 2007,positive,we drove 150 miles to watch this movie just so we could say that we saw it it was a fun idea until we started home and had the 150 mile drive to think about how they filmed the movie and freak ourselves out
Jul 29 2007,positive,it either works for you or it doesnt  it scared the crap out of me
Jul 29 2007,negative,it was good when i saw it for the first time in the theatre and thought it was realnow its just annoying

Jul 29 2007,negative,totally stupid i could have done better
Jul 29 2007,negative,failed to be scary  it seemed so fake to me that it didnt catch my interest
Jul 29 2007,positive,for a movie to actually scare me is awesome it was original cheap to make and its fun to tell people its true before they watch must see
Jul 29 2007,positive,omg the last scene was really creepy it reminds me of a time when i was 45 and my sisters friend said someone was murdered in a disused caravan in a wasteland near our estate we went in and i pictured a scene it was a scary moment  something makes me wish they did find a a tape and that was the one bit they salvaged
Jul 29 2007,negative,dumb what was all the hype about
Jul 29 2007,positive,this is the type of horror i like purely psychological
Jul 29 2007,positive,i thought this was very well done it started the new genre of doc horror unless you count cannibal holocaust very tense especially in the ending scene not so much scary as it is tense but still well done
Jul 29 2007,positive,brilliant lowbudget creativity  the sequel was one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Jul 29 2007,positive,very  creepy i cant sleep alone in a tent now

Jul 29 2007,neutral,should have stayed as a project
Jul 29 2007,positive,i admit i was utterly sucked into the prerelease ad campaign so when finally i saw the movie i was primed to be scared and i was
Jul 29 2007,positive,if you watch it on your own its a little unsettling but the camera work absolutely irritates the hell out of me
Jul 29 2007,positive,exceedingly terrifying might be worth all the hype this movie is quite interesting in so many ways mainly interesting in that people actually think its a movie with filmmakers when the three actors shot nearly all of the footage popular solely because of the ridiculous guerilla marketing on the internet and such the ending is fantastic though wow chilling
Jul 29 2007,negative,pretty much the most rediculously horrible movie ever made
Jul 29 2007,positive,it was made cheap and if you think about it its pretty simple but so freaky the last scene really got me haha
Jul 29 2007,positive,for hype alone i give this movie three stars  no other movie has had the kind of speculation and hysteria around it like this did  a very basic film with an interesting idea behind it
Jul 29 2007,positive,kinda stupidand borin
Jul 29 2007,negative,dont care much for itto hard to pay attention and it felt like i was working out with how much the camera moved
Jul 29 2007,positive,a very good thriller i was actually surprised i did not want to see this until i finally gave into all the hype i have read over the years and i will admit i thought it was real until i started doing research online half way through the movie it was heartpounding and definitely a very good thriller the ending was good because it left the reader wondering what happens while giving them enough to make it up on their own the acting was raw and brilliant and very well done
Jul 29 2007,neutral,creepy very creepy nothing really happens though so its kinda boring
Jul 29 2007,positive,loved itkept me on the edge of my seat
Jul 29 2007,positive,the second one sucked
Jul 29 2007,positive,youll either love this or hate it for me it was all about the suspence of the film rather than the end product everyone who said it was crap would still never camp in the woods admit it maybe even better on dvd cos it looks like a proper home video
Jul 29 2007,positive,i know a lot dont like this but to me it has an unxplainable appeal
Jul 29 2007,positive,the first of its kind interesting take on a scary documentery

Jul 28 2007,positive,freaky and odd  not for everyone  when the movie was over there was a huge question mark on my face lol
Jul 28 2007,positive,for as dizzying and lame as the cinematography wasthis movie genuinely frightened me i partook in the internet hype too though all the stuff online about the back story really helped to make the movie that much more interesting because you know more of whats going on even though theyre not saying itkind of like when you read a book thats been made into a movie and you have a better understanding of all the nuances
Jul 28 2007,positive,at the time pretty scary i couldnt walk to my door alone because i lived with woods on both sides
Jul 28 2007,positive,good for the one night scar fest

Jul 26 2007,neutral,remember back when it came out when everyone seriously thought it was true and then there were zillions of copycat versions id be lying if i said i didnt make one
Jul 26 2007,negative,one of the most retarded movies in historythis movie made me want to watch the scary movie series just because i wanted to see it get made fun ofthe only reason it was the least bit enthralling is because it was based on a true story
Jul 26 2007,positive,on first sight   utterly terrifying but repeated viewings are not recommended  everything good about it diminishes with time
Jul 26 2007,negative,a complete waste of my time just classic worthless sundance junk
Jul 26 2007,positive,great movie at the time it came out
Jul 26 2007,neutral,way too much hype  i can see it though since many people thought it was real  bare wench project was  a welcomed off shoot
Jul 26 2007,negative,will not watch again
Jul 26 2007,positive,liked it in the theatre but not very good upon rewatching
Jul 26 2007,positive,my dad thought this was actually real hahaha if i had to write lol this woul be the time
Jul 26 2007,positive,the best horror movie of the 1990s the concept is brilliant though cannibal holocaust did it first the tension is palpable and to this day it remains the only horror film to honestly frighten me
Jul 26 2007,negative,strange and confusing movie another overrated film
Jul 26 2007,negative,the first time was quite interesting even scary at times but not worth watching again

Jul 26 2007,negative,i have flashback headaches just thinking about it
Jul 26 2007,neutral,doesnt hold up to repeat viewings but that first time was great
Jul 26 2007,negative,some good fights badly done video and some notso creepy events highly overrated but kudos for the novelty not cannibal holocaust did the exact same thing way before this movie was released but i guess the story was a bit different and a bit more graphic
Jul 26 2007,positive,pretty much a ripoff of cannibal holocaust but it creates a creepy atmosphere with no effects what so ever
Jul 26 2007,negative,are you kidding me this sucked
Jul 26 2007,negative,i intentionally watched this alone in the dark in a house in the woods boring
Jul 26 2007,negative,i got a headache watching this  and didnt quite get the hype
Jul 26 2007,positive,this movie is original  i like that they shoot alot of the scenes in the dark  i found i was trying to see something in the nothing  given nothing is ever shown it does a good job in scaring you as much as a movie can
Jul 26 2007,positive,i liked it more than i thought i would the backlash on this movie has been so fierce that its hard to tell whether its over or underrated at this point i thought it was good but not great there are certainly aspects of it that are brilliant the verisimilitude of it all is extremely impressive thanks in no small part to the skills of the actors just listen to the affected lilt that heather donahue puts into her voice when shes narrating the film within a film  its one of countless little details that make everything were watching seem very very real the movie skates by for about two thirds of the runtime on great acting and atmosphere as the three student filmmakers bicker about whether or not theyre lost ironically its when one of them disappears and the scary shit starts to go down that the movie actually gets less interesting a lot of unexplained running and screaming follows this is scary for a while but becomes more tiresome the more of it we see and theres a lot one of the films biggest strengths is that we never really see whats supposed to be so scary but theres a fine line between keeping us in suspense and keeping us completely in the dark about whats happening this is literal darkness too theres quite a lot of time wherein its too dark to see anything and all we have to go on is audio after a while the remaining two stumble upon an seemingly abandoned extremely creepy house providing a lastminute twist that pulled me back into the story the movie ends in this house but leaves us predictably bereft of any answers as to whats actually happened its really remarkable how scary it is for how little we see and for that directors sanchez and myrick deserve credit but by the end of it i felt like they were using these gifts as an excuse to do absolutely nothing else
Jul 26 2007,negative,cheesy and wasnt worth the hype they produced for the film
Jul 26 2007,negative,overratedcrappy ending

Jul 26 2007,negative,lamest movie ever  i am usually frightened senseless by any scary movie but this one held no frights  if you going to make a movie where the forest is supposed to be creepy actually film in a forest not some lot with scragly sticks near a clearing

Jul 25 2007,negative,umm wtf however i have to applaud them for a movie that grossed over a hundred million and only cost like 60000 to make good thinking guys
Jul 25 2007,positive,the greatest marketing campaign for an indie film to date
Jul 25 2007,neutral,the first technical use of torture porn  or was that waterworld zing
Jul 25 2007,positive,would have been better if heather didnt appear on the tonight show the day before it came out kinda ruined the advertising campaign
Jul 25 2007,positive,my favorite horror film ever  this movie scared the shit out of me  to me adding as much realism as possible is what makes great scary films

Jul 24 2007,positive,it was great for its time
Jul 24 2007,positive,the advertising campaign for the movie was genius by making it appear to be real footage they were crowned with big bucks  it sucks as much as it is creative and ingenious i loved it and hated it at the same time but mostly i admire the creators tenacity  so i really wouldnt know how to rate it  i suppose its an inspiration to lowbudget filmmakers everywhere

Jul 24 2007,positive,funny scary disappointing then overhyped
Jul 24 2007,negative,i laughed most of the time lol
Jul 24 2007,negative,im going to give this a half star not because thats how much i liked the film its shockingly awful but because the producers did a wonderful job fooling so many bloody idiots into thinking this was real losers
Jul 24 2007,positive,freaky im glad i saw it now and not when i was younger because it would have scared the s out of me very realistic and left a lot to the viewers imagination a crucial tactic that is not used much any more in a horrorsuspense film ie cloverfield

Jul 24 2007,positive,i actually thought this film was great but i went in thinking it was real i love the originality but it was of course taken by the media and overdone and bastardised until it was in disfavor with america
Jul 24 2007,positive,one word to sum this up is organic i would also throw in highly creative and a little disturbing this movie leaves you holding your breath till the end the very fucked up end i may add i wanted to see a sequel to this but i took that back when they came out with one but all in all a great movie

Jul 24 2007,neutral,first was great never bother watching it again
Jul 24 2007,positive,almost forgotten about now but it was really good and something very different
Jul 24 2007,negative,not all they said it was cracked up to be
Jul 24 2007,positive,despite whats been said over the years the blair witch project is a truly creative and experimental film it is genuinly intense and has a oneofakind method to its way of storytelling

Jul 23 2007,negative,was too much of a gimmick at the time to have any sort of lasting film legacy

Jul 23 2007,positive,the blair witch project proves that you dont really need a lot of money as long as you have an original idea out there  the acting is bad but you really shouldnt expect anything great going into this anyway  the camerawork and storytelling from the students point of view is interesting and is really what makes this movie

Jul 20 2007,positive,for what this movie is and the money at which it was made i think the blair witch project is brilliantly done  its scary without really showing anything  no blood no violence and nowitch  they manage to create a creepy atmosphere with just simple suggestion and off camera sounds  i think any fan of the thrillerhorror genre will get a kick out of this movie
Jul 20 2007,neutral,everytime that guy is standing in the courner i think he is peeing

Jul 20 2007,positive,if you go to the woods in the dark could you at least bring a brighter flashlight
Jul 20 2007,negative,completely direthe makers should be forced to give up everything theyve made on the film and the money distributed to those who hated this crapwith the fund being topped up by all the fools who fell for the hype  biggest most annoying element was the kids not taking guns into the forest its america isnt it an ending where the blair witch got blasted for being such a lame concept would have redeemed the film somewhat
Jul 19 2007,negative,i still never saw this crap  but i saw the adand everyone ruined it when it came  outso
Jul 19 2007,positive,this seemed so fake but alittle creepy

Jul 19 2007,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen the girl was so annoying i wanted the blair witch to come out and bash her skull in or something ill give props for the working the whole low budget thing thats the only reason i gave a half star too bad there arent negative stars
Jul 19 2007,positive,in the theatre rating

Jul 19 2007,positive,for the life of me i cant conceive of why everyone i know hates this film  i think people were pissed at the marketing campaign designed to make audiences believe that it was real which has nothing to do with the intentions of the original filmmakers  i had the privilege of seeing it without knowing anything about it so the experience was untainted  heaven forbid we see something original folks  great concept well executed horrifying    one of only two or three films ever that genuinely scared me

Jul 18 2007,negative,i cant figure out what all the fuss about this movie was
Jul 18 2007,positive,fuck naysayers this is awesome  it was actually creepy and was played realistically  the only weak part was heather donahue who seemed to be the only one who felt as if they were acting  everything else worked
Jul 18 2007,positive,the concept  hype was really great for this movie much better than the movie itself  but since they did so well with all of that i will inflate my rating

Jul 18 2007,negative,the whole shaking camera thing just made me feel sick  and it really wasnt that scary
Jul 18 2007,neutral,watched a little laughed a little cried a little
Jul 18 2007,negative,all i can say is stupid
Jul 18 2007,negative,a case of marketing that is more brilliant than the actual film
Jul 18 2007,negative,why does everyone think this movie was so cool even in the movie theater my sister and i were laughing more often than we were scared and im not sure why anyone would think it was real thats just crazy talk
Jul 18 2007,positive,wow i was scared and i hate the end
Jul 18 2007,neutral,a gimmick but a wellmade gimmick considering the budget

Jul 18 2007,negative,a complete waste of time and money
Jul 18 2007,negative,i love a good stiritup film but this  why
Jul 18 2007,negative,i was one of those who wanted their money back dont bother watching it just go into the woods have a friend grab your head try to look at a tree while they shake your head around so you cant actually make you anything other than leaves and dont look directly at a pile of rocks  that about covers the experience granted i do still yell josh tell me where you are josh when in the woods
Jul 18 2007,negative,this was by far one of the dumbest movies ive ever seen  nothing scary about it

Jul 17 2007,negative,why didnt they jsy follow the river
Jul 17 2007,neutral,a little stupid upon repeat viewings
Jul 17 2007,positive,one of the most intense atmospheric and downright creepy movies i have ever seen the realistic handheld camcorder style as well as the less is more approach to the scares works perfectly and you feel like you are right there in the middle of it even though you never see anything there is something deeply terrifying about being lost in the woods hearing ever more freaky things off in the distance in the pitch darkness of the night and the film perfectly captures that feeling the performances from the three leads add to the experience no end their reactions to the events and their growing despair being exactly what you would expect from a trio of amateur filmmakers out in the woods the blair witch legend itself was very creepy and it gets more and more disturbing as you realise the same nightmare is happening again with you right there in the middle of it the film flows very well and superbly builds up to the unsettling yet memorable ending an original genuinely scary horror movie
Jul 17 2007,positive,saw it at art house theatre before the hype  thought it was a screening of footage they found  scared the shite out of me

Jul 16 2007,negative,gets tiring after a while

Jul 16 2007,negative,this movie makes me motion sick

Jul 16 2007,negative,lmfao the bare pimp project lmfao
Jul 16 2007,neutral,it was very long drawn out it wasnt even scary at all sure it was freaky i mean i wouldve been scared to if there was something watching me and i keeping ending up to where i started the last seen was a little bit scary and tense but the ending didnt make much sense
Jul 16 2007,positive,i saw this before all the hype  it was great  needless to say hollywood made it sound better than it was and it lead to the constant disappointment by others  i still like it
Jul 16 2007,positive,a scary movie i like the house
Jul 16 2007,negative,admittedly scary but lacking in every other possible way the chicken or the egg question is in effect here do teenagers swear because of seeing movies like this or do movies like this attempt to show real life through the copious swearing either way it gets old fast the camerawork or lack thereof is pretty interesting to see but then again the jerky motions and thin plot make it nothing youd want to see more than once
Jul 16 2007,neutral,good premise props for ultra lowbudget otherwise it is a horror movie whoo hoo
Jul 16 2007,positive,wasnt what people built it up to be

Jul 15 2007,negative,terrible not scary at all
Jul 15 2007,positive,not excellent i kinda like the end and the ambiance of this movie
Jul 15 2007,positive,the blair witch project is a film of uncanny realism achieved by blurring the lines between reality and fiction the locations used in the film are extremely effective simply because they give you a real sense of being in the middle of nowhere this authenticity is hightened by the lack of special effects and excellent acting
Jul 15 2007,neutral,although it has its detractors now this film was great because it pioneered the free hand camera tecnique as a legitimate directing tool speilburg later used it in saving private ryan
Jul 15 2007,positive,this movie actually spooked me
Jul 15 2007,positive,i saw this when it first came out i was like 8 years old and it terrified me

Jul 15 2007,neutral,the ending where the guys taking a leak in the corner really killed the suspense
Jul 15 2007,negative,damn this movie to the nine circles of hell
Jul 15 2007,positive,i think basically all you need for a movie like this is that the actors you hand the camera to be good actors and these people though not high end hollywood talent are certainly very good actors also interesting to note is that this is more of a fullblown suspense piece than an actual horror movie you see more gore in the same style of film making from the pg13 cloverfield than this movie you see nothing scary in this movie its all in the sounds you never see the blair witch you see where the witch had been screwing with them and thats about it and one final thing i usually hate it when they kill everybody at the end of the movie but this i didnt mind it was kind of like a way of perpetuating the myth
Jul 15 2007,negative,dreary and annoying those dribbling nostrils were the scariest thing about the entire film
Jul 15 2007,positive,one of the most effective horror movie i have ever seen rationality while viewing is harder here than in other films great

Jul 13 2007,positive,no matter what fans may think of this movie the truth is its a pretty darn scary film due to its technical flair the film has a docudrama feel thats gritty realistic and uses no soundtracks nor fast editing the techniques are unprecedented for a horror film if you havent seen it watch it at least once art house fans may actually like it

Jul 12 2007,negative,what a damn waste of filmstock but credit needs to be given to the marketing dept for  tricking  making everyone want to see this pile of talentless crap
Jul 12 2007,positive,my heart really went out to these characters a very convincing film and absolutely frustrating i kept wanting the filmmaker to turn the camera off to focus on finding a way home of course had she done that the film wouldve ended right quick as successful as the emotion is there arent enough supernaturalspooky elements not nearly scary enough

Jul 12 2007,positive,so stupid good for a laugh though
Jul 12 2007,negative,this is really dull and slightly annoying up until the last ten minutes or so when it gets creepy and exciting but thats kind of the point because the ending wouldnt work as well if the rest wasnt so mundane but at the end of the day youve sat through an hour or so of people camping and thats just not worth the punchline

Jul 11 2007,positive,love it or hate it the blair witch projected presented a different form of horror with a style that did not rely on excessive violence instead it relied on realism suspense and characterization the movie is well packaged and stylized well and has a good and original film to that will leave many horror fans pleased with plenty of others disappointed

Jul 11 2007,positive,we researched this at the theatreme and jeremy sustaitadont let him tell you any different
Jul 11 2007,positive,because of way produced created a lot of excitement people thought it was real

Jul 11 2007,positive,great show that i know not everyone likes but personally a good thrill and all the better for making it on the cheappart two was terrible beyond reason
Jul 11 2007,negative,i still dont know what happened
Jul 11 2007,positive,a genre that was once looked upon as a cinematic powerhouse has become nothing more than profit loving garbage what happened to the horror genre in its prime it treated us to a psychological thrill ride driven by its sophisticated understanding of our subconscious fears nowadays with some exceptions it repugnantly focuses on mutilation and torture or more simply barefaced sadism modernday horror encompasses misguided scare tactics its characters bleed suffer and customarily die painful yet pointlessly gory deaths is this what they call entertainment does anyone know where hitchcock went if only he were here to judge productions that vomit out material that should be quarantined in a poison control center     and god brought blood water frogs lice flies diseases of livestock boils hail locusts darkness death of the first born and regrettably wolf creek 2005 the story is simple a journey of three hikers liz hunter kristy earl and ben mitchell whose situation moves from the innocent beginning of the film to the presence of australian lunatic mick taylors world of laceration after typing the last sentence my fingers froze and my neck became painfully incapacitated      then my eye balls slowly rolled to the back of my head accompanied by a wave of nausea as i realized that i may have mistakenly created the impression that wolf creek is in fact a movie wolf creek is anything but a movie  it is a hell sentence that even a convict on death row doesnt deserve this film is clearly intended for disturbed males who have many and i mean many unresolved mother issues that sadly do not respond to any form of therapy the entire movie dedicates itself to the desecration and sexual torture of its two females hunter and earl are the films exclusive focal points of torture      strangely we are spared from watching the anguish of the male character mitchell why was the film laid out in this manner well because suffragette greg mclean director knew that an audience of disturbed males would prefer it that way but aaron you may ask isnt it based on true events ok  even more of a reason not to make it into entertainment      sometimes there are exceptions to movies that entail sexual molestation and still proceed to stay on track for example the devils rejects unlike wolf creek only dwells on misogynistic acts for a short period of time letting the movie continue to succeed in what it is really trying to do  scare the villain of wolf creek is supposed to be the main source of fear but is instead just the main source of offensiveness it was actually offensive to a point that even if there was an idea the movie was trying to get across i had no interest in knowing      youre so weak mick says after telling the girl that hes going to cut off her genitals i wish i could tell you how i truly feel about the film but unfortunately i am not supposed to curse     next comes a horror film with potential but unfortunately it lets extravagant amounts of gore take the place of nailbiting tension hostel was directed by eli roth who lets say has a very weird sense of humor that ultimately produced a desire in me to incinerate the movie the credits include the phrase quentin tarantino presents suggesting that roth is going to try to follow the lead of genius director tarantino well he failed      two american backpackers paxton and josh go through europe in search of hot babes in a nutshell they get screwed over and mutilated the end when we consider the brilliant directing style of quentin tarantino we see dark comic violence that never takes itself too seriously for example in kill bill when the characters get their limbs cut off the exaggerated use of blood isnt gross but strangely enough funny and amusing roth attempts the same thing but instead creates a path that is too dark for the light of humor      thus when one of the characters gets her eye socket ripped out and yellow puss drips down her face as she screams in agony theres no chance of a comic affect unless youre on the same level as the son of sam or oj simpson at a time when we americans are apprehensive about going to europe roth taps into that fear without showing us anything of consequence unless you find excessive amounts of gore and tediously superficial characters somehow meaningful so you may ask why did the movie make around 50 million well i guess some people take pleasure in gore and tediously superficial characters hey the faster they die the faster you get to sprint out of the theatre im not complaining     so as ive tried to make clear in the last 15 to 20 years there has been a dearth of good horror films however there is one that even when matched up to its greatly appreciated classic predecessors will still be ranked at the top of the list this film is the blair witch project a genius masterpiece that has earned divine bragging rights in the horror kingdom      ok for those of you who havent yet spit on my article and lit it on fire while screaming a fascist chant thanks for sticking with me a description of the blair witch project is my attempt to reward you for your patience a movie that cost a mere 350000 to make with no known actors a home video camera and no violence added while still preserving its mesmerizing effect is in fact the real definition of horror it holds the guinness world record for biggest profit movie of all time raking in 140000000      the blair witch is about three film students heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams who are creating an investigatory documentary on of course the blair witch they make their way into the woods where the urban legend arose shortly after they get lost in an eerie wilderness however thats only half of the movies horror the rest comes from the feelings we get when we observe normal people in a fictional situation that somehow doesnt seem so fictional at all      the drama between the three characters is as real as it gets it became evident that it wasnt just the blair witch that was crushing their sanity but in fact the clash between the three characters themselves      if you examine the blair witch project at a deep level you will find that it is more than just another horror film this is america we killed all of our natural resources the female character says      is the blair witch project really about a witch or is it really a metaphor about nature or whats left of it defending itself the three film students smoked cigarettes kicked over rocks made fires and pretty much treated the woods as if it was their own garbage dumpster selfish americans the blair witch project and its psychological predecessor the birds by alfred hitchcock both give voice to nature who sorry to say deserves to revenge itself on the human race each film makes an eerie artistic political statement the blair witch project not only brings us face to face with our fear of the dark and the unknown it also uses that fear to teach us about values      as i look back at nostalgic sunday car rides with my parents when i was a little kid i have many memories of passing by shops and annoyingly asking my parents how much money they thought the certain business was making my dad would always have the same response it doesnt matter how much money something makes in life aaron what matters is the meaning that that certain thing contributes to the world      now that the era of technology is here i find that real meaning and values in society are moving towards extinction this is reflected in the horror film genre without the technology needed for special effects horror was forced to put a magnifying glass on people themselves characters were developed and meaningful messages for life were presented with technology and special effects growing stronger each year the forecast for horror looks rainy if only i was alive at the high point of the genre then again that would make me 60 years old so never mind

Jul 10 2007,negative,the most unscary scary movie ever i was really disappointed
Jul 10 2007,negative,so when this came out people rant and raved about how it was the best horror film since hitchcocki want to know what they were smoking the end is so dumb i almost cried not out of fright but out of anger that i wasted my money
Jul 10 2007,positive,even though it was a hit until you find out it is a fake
Jul 10 2007,positive,the verdict is still out on this one
Jul 10 2007,negative,freaked me outbut i was young and at a party
Jul 10 2007,neutral,a great money making movie but really who would want to watch this now
Jul 10 2007,positive,to the date the only horror movie i have fully enjoyed i heard about the advertising campaign and even if i didnt believe on it i forgot completely and felt the terror the actors are amazing when i think they were not professional i wonder how many talents not very promoted are being wasted in this moment the lack of script is suffered sometimes because the action turns slow and is not believable that the main character films everything when she speaks to the camera near the end asking for pitty and feeling sorry you will want to cry and the way the movie concludes is surprising tbwp plays with our basics instincts something not many directors know how to do its a masterpiece ingenious and unforgettable
Jul 10 2007,negative,not scary at all fucking lame
Jul 10 2007,negative,hated this movie with a passion
Jul 10 2007,positive,ok overall good to watch in a tent in the backyard though
Jul 10 2007,positive,a genuine horror film people who say it wasnt scary must find mindless gore scary because they lack the intelligence to find true suspense thrilling

Jul 10 2007,negative,overrated bunch of kids running around arguing
Jul 10 2007,negative,it was very dumb and if you believed it was real when it came out youre just as dumb
Jul 10 2007,positive,i loved the blair witch project mainly because i got to see it before the hype machine got rolling it cost 15p to film and only one jvc video camera dont you know or something similar and made trillions of pounds
Jul 10 2007,positive,psychologically scary partsand then annoying arguring drama most of it was boringbut the end genuinely creeped me out convincingly realbut not
Jul 10 2007,positive,the thing that made this one of the scariest movies ever is the fact that its filmed from the hands of one of the actors threw a camcorter i could actually hear my heart beating it was so fucking scary
Jul 10 2007,positive,creeeeeeeeeepy totally creeeeeeepy
Jul 10 2007,negative,how stupid and pointless can it get

Jul 10 2007,neutral,the shakycam made my friends and i literally nauseous we were in the very front row but we got the satisfaction of having all the worthless characters die at the end
Jul 10 2007,positive,i like this i make no bones laughter into screams thats my favourite
Jul 10 2007,positive,this movie was interesting on one hand it had a phenomenal advertising campaign the first id ever seen go through the internet in a such a grass roots way  second the mode of telling the story was actually pretty cool using the journal entry style made it almost novel like and the last scene of the movie that of seeing josh standing facing the corner away from heather is pretty scary to consider    however that being said i still can not fathom how the fuck you get lost in the woods seriously as a scout i nearly lost it when i saw them get repeatedly lost with or without a compass
Jul 10 2007,negative,a straight up bad film didnt enjoy this wasnt very scary i could of just made this film in my local park
Jul 10 2007,negative,too bad they dont have a negative star rating
Jul 10 2007,positive,more than a little concepty but its an effective and engaging story  hype sort of killed the fauxdoc aesthetic for a lot of people but the whole oh its not real so it sucks response is more than a little hypocritical  the final shot is an underappreciated chiller
Jul 10 2007,negative,a waist oh an hour and a half
Jul 10 2007,positive,another brilliant movie at the time pretty spooky
Jul 10 2007,positive,great concept has since grown and now we have youtube thanks bwp

Jul 10 2007,positive,found this genuinely creepy
Jul 10 2007,negative,i think chris rock said it best about this movie somebody said this movie cost 150000 to producewell somebody must be walking around with 149000 in their pockets if you can visualize what a movie that cost 1000 would look like and imagine a movie with the quality of most uwe boll moviesthen there u gothis movie in a nutshell if thats not enough imagine your friends making a home video of them pulling a prank on you and then selling it to a movie company without you knowingnext to understand how u will feel after watching this imagine how pissed off u would probably bethere u go
Jul 10 2007,positive,scariest movie of all time
Jul 10 2007,positive,i wish i was older and got to see this in the movie theaters first time i saw it was on tv and just thinknig it was a swear fest in dark woods
Jul 10 2007,positive,when i saw it i didnt know it was fake scared the shit out of me
Jul 10 2007,negative,this is a classic example on how stupid people in horror movies can be when i watch this movie i get insanly angry how dumb can you possibly get at one point in this movie you can see a small creek why not try to follow that one until you get somewhereand the sundont they know what side of the morning sky it rises even in blair witch land i seriously belive the laws of physics apply even sothe characters try every idiotic way to get killed no matter whatpeople that stupid deserves to die this movie is so stupid i want to set my cat on fire and nuter myself with a blunt instrument
Jul 10 2007,neutral,i didnt really care for this movie it wasnt nothing like i thought it was going to be
Jul 10 2007,negative,ok i think it was stupid and not scary at all
Jul 10 2007,positive,it was definately an orignalwell thought out
Jul 10 2007,negative,if this were actually real itd be scary as shit but the fact that its staged creates a distraction and allows for no horror
Jul 10 2007,positive,i hated it but the end made me love it and now i bought it hahaha
Jul 10 2007,neutral,for its time it was a pretty good movie i read all about it online before i went and saw it so i knew it as only a movie and nothing real but they seemed to have fooled a lot of people lol great idea
Jul 10 2007,negative,haah i got owned by the hype when i was 15 or whatever
Jul 10 2007,positive,excellently effective in terms of marketing and planning this film was a happy little success story and to be honest it wasnt that bad its not the kind of thing you ever need to see again but it was a real treat to see it for the first time in theaters on opening day  still questioning whether or not it was real fun times outside of that the film has some genuinely chilling moments its a clumsy film at best but considering how it was made  impressive
Jul 10 2007,positive,its been almost eight years since ive seen it but i do remember it being very scary  the beauty of it is the way it shows you absolutely nothing but still manages to scare the hell out of you  the actors express genuine terror and the way the film plays on the senses of the audience is masterful
Jul 10 2007,negative,quite dumb they shouldnt have made a sequel
Jul 10 2007,positive,i love the documentary style of this film it makes it seem more realistic it definitely scared the crap out of me and thats hard for a movie to do

Jul 10 2007,positive,it fooled us enough i guess
Jul 10 2007,positive,im convinced theres a witch or something in my backyard because of this movie i will never look at a pile of rocks the same way again
Jul 9 2007,positive,contrary to popular belief this is a true horror film it does what all the classic horror films do especially the old italian and french ones and hitchcock it lets you hear things and makes you think you saw something but it leaves it all to the imagination and in the end it was not only one of the scariest films of the 90s but also one of the most original   a lot of parodies have been made out of it but thats the most flattering aspect of film but also thats the sad aspect of it because not a lot of people seem to take this film seriously anymore make fun of it all you want but you try and watch this film from start to finish and not get creeped out i really would compare this film to the exorcist because there is so much tension made from just human emotion and creepy images and sounds   very creepy and if you werent in the know its pretty believable not only with the interviews but the conversations between the three characters and of course the endingchills seriously
Jul 9 2007,positive,this is shit
Jul 9 2007,negative,i still dont get how this film captured an audience it was too plotless and painful for me to watch in its entirety

Jul 9 2007,positive,originality gets points in my book  it was kinda scary the first time around
Jul 9 2007,neutral,had potential execution was kinda poor the best thing about this movie is the people who thought it was real
Jul 9 2007,positive,concept wise this film was a blatant ripoff of a movie called the last broadcast about a news crew that disappears investigating the legend of the new jersey devil normally this sort of  borrowedoriginality turns my stomach i have to give them credit for taking it a step further though its not easy to pull off a hoax these days i found out the truth before seeing it but my older sister was shaken to the core by the thought that all of this actually happened she spent hours coming up with possible theories while i tried not to laugh points for pulling the wool over americas eyes but not much for the film itself
Jul 9 2007,positive,this movie has taken some heat but it was groundbreaking and it scared the hell out of me in the theater

Jul 9 2007,negative,i think i was the only person not scared
Jul 9 2007,negative,unbelievable bad had a crowd of friends round imported the dvd from the us before it was out in the uk and waited to be scared shtless still waiting at one point it looked like something was in danger of happening then the credits mercifully rolled

Jul 9 2007,positive,the camera work makes this believable
Jul 9 2007,positive,scared the shit out of me i thought it was real and i watched it on halloween night couldnt sleep to well
Jul 9 2007,positive,a very original idea which has since been parodied countless times worth watching but give the sequels a miss
Jul 9 2007,neutral,i saw this movie at the uptown theatre in minneapolis a few hours before i went on a weeklong trip to the boundary waters with steve lindstrom and his wiry brother
Jul 9 2007,negative,this originally was to be filmed where i live i hear but it didnt turn out that scary anyway
Jul 9 2007,negative,can you say horrible
Jul 9 2007,neutral,the first time saw it i thought it was neat in an odd sort of way but sometimes going back for a second look is not advisable

Jul 9 2007,positive,i was scared but i havent seen it since it first came out  i have a feeling blair witch wont stand the test of time
Jul 9 2007,neutral,if nothing else give it props for leading so many people on
Jul 9 2007,positive,i was one of the few that thought this was scary i think most people are used to seeing the monsters so i think its refreshing to be teased

Jul 8 2007,positive,i was not impressed when i saw this movie but there it was sitting in the back of my mind and later  much later  on a long and quiet lonely summer night when only the wind and creaking wood could be heard in the house and i found myself in the dark and my mind wandering somewhere between this and the color out of space
Jul 8 2007,positive,it was a pretty convincing portrayal of a documentary  if you need something to do one night go pick up this movie to give a watching  its definately better than doing nothing
