Apr 7 2024,positive, one year shy of its 70th anniversary godzilla makes a return to the big screen with a tojo effort that makes the american renditions look like drivein disasters in godzilla minus one at the tale end of world war ii a japanese kamikaze pilot ryunosuke kamiki makes an emergency landing on a small mechanics island where he hopes no one will figure out that hes deserted in the face of fear his worst nightmares are realized but no one will bear witness as godzilla strikes and kills nearly everyone on the island except our protagonist and one mechanic as he returns home the destruction of the war has left the country reeling and with his parents dead he seems adrift in his shame and frustration returning to work as a necessity its while working on a wooden fishing boat blowing up floating mines that he and his crewmates discover that godzilla is back and will be heading for mainland japan they cant stop him the first time but a crew of retired military seamen will certainly try to stop his eventual second arrival while the film doesnt entirely deal with the human devastation the war caused nor the nuclear origins of godzilla it paints the japanese people as beleaguered but undeterred in rising from the devastation and preventing it from happening again that theme succinctly frames the postwar struggle of japanese society and its intent to rise from the ashes stronger and better it gives the narrative added resonance even with all the monster elements that make it fit within the long history of godzilla films the performances range from passive kamiki and minami hamabe as his wife to excessive kuranosuke sasaki as the gruff boat captain with only yuki yamada as the young crewman who didnt get to fight in the war due to his age striking the right balance while those exaggerated performances fit better within a traditional godzilla movie this felt like it was trying to be a more crafty disaster movie than monster movie to that end the visual effects were largely good though the opening sequence where kamiki is landing on the island looked incredibly chintzy as if they wasted their budget on everything else and had to make do with the start beginning poorly can have its benefits but thats a rare situation and this wasnt one of them godzilla minus one in spite of its flaws is an enjoyable film that hits its beats nearly perfectly eliciting emotion with careful precision the king of monsterdisaster films remains such in his latest outing while it might not be the dramatic interpretation we should have gotten its still immensely entertaining
Apr 1 2024,positive, godzilla minus one 2023 is set in postworld war ii asia and follows koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a former japanese kamikaze fighter pilot who is disgraced and feels guilt ridden over choosing to obey his filial duty of surviving over his countrys orders to die for his nation as japan begins to recover koichi cannot move on and follow his heart by marrying noriko minami hamabe when godzilla begins attacking japan he finds a path to redemption and is determined to stop godzilla so japan does not have to fall into ruin again japanese godzilla movies were a staple of my childhood and a vague memory i have not revisited them in adulthood nor seen the more recent installations godzilla 1998 starring matthew broderick was an utter disappointment and godzilla 2014 was barely a notch above though the subsequent monsterverse movies have shown some promise godzilla minus one is critically acclaimed for a reason it has excellent production values has a majority japanese cast and covers fresh territory by commencing during a time that has only been alluded to in the mythology godzilla was a dinosaur that mutated because of exposure to nuclear radiation this godzilla is thick a friend with zero interest in seeing the film said that this kaiju has boobs which is hard to unsee but neglected to mention the giant thighs and butt godzilla is downright curvy but objectifying this snowflake spiked overgrown lizard would be a mistake according to the mythology westerners treat godzilla like a monster but japan treats him as a destructive god if they were describing godzillas regeneration abilities which renders the creature immortal they are right equally intimidating is the laserfocused redeyed stare which evinces a determination and focus that indicates brains backing godzillas brute force a favored feature is when godzillas spikes rise and glow bright white blue to indicate when godzilla is going to use their atomic breath which has the effect of an atomic bomb though hiroshima and nagasaki are never explicitly referenced the shockwave goes in and out like breath and wreaks complete havoc blasting things away then sucking them back in godzilla becomes a sanitized denationalized symbol of japans conquerors in world war iia chaotic merciless death dealer godzillas attacks are random and undeserving a force of nature unlike the consequences of world war ii which were arguably earned initially it seemed promising that godzilla minus one was set in postworld war ii japan i overshot my expectations and thought that the film would grapple with the atrocities that they committed during that era but instead it deals with the defeat and demoralization koichi is easy to like since he is insubordinate to a bellicose regime so it is hopefully unlikely that if the film rewound koichi would not be caught doing anything that should earn him a ticket to hell he still feels guilty because writer and director takashi yamazaki is still japanese and everyone has a certain degree of national pride so he frames this disobedience as a failure to protect the defenseless when he has the ability to fight there would be no need to defend people if japan had not become allies with the nazis and started attacking people as koichi rebuilds his life including saving noriko he cannot enjoy it noriko does not have a fleshedout character she saves babies wants to live and begs kochi to confide in her yamazaki does a great job of showing that time is passing by showing the environment transform from ruins to solid structures and the fashion changes from traditional to western when noriko decides to get a job and wears a suit it felt as if the camera treated her like the equivalent of pamela anderson running on the beach in the end her will to live becomes optional when godzilla decides that he wants to take the same train that she is on and she just appears to give up honestly same girl same no one is going to save japan the us even rescinds demilitarization and says may the odds be ever in your favor because it is too busy with the soviet union the japanese government gets nothing but shade from its citizens and the characters deride their government as secretive and unhelpful so a rag tag bunch of navy veterans now family men and one former kamikaze decide to forge a plan to stop an immortal while godzilla minus one sidesteps the awkwardness of japans role by slamming its government it was a little troubling how easy it was to find battleships and fighter planes that were supposed to be decommissioned yes one ship is officially returned to japan only for godzilla to immediately destroy it but the nation that raped its neighbors is not someone that you want hiding weapons two seconds later yamazaki is using godzilla minus one to create an alternate history where the world war ii japanese veterans are not possible war criminals but valiant defenders of people the protagonists last name shikishima happens to be the same as the shikishima squandron which conducted the first successful kamikaze attack on the us ew it comes from shikishima no yamato gokoro an edo era motoori noringas tanka a short poem which is hung in the yushukan war museum which was built in the late nineteenth century but honors kamikaze pilots in world war ii the poem reads if someone asks about the yamato spirit spirit of oldtrue japan of shikishima a poetic name of japanit is the flowers of yamazakura that are fragrant in the asahi rising sun by erasing history as the aggressor and turning the japanese into helpless outmatched defenders yamazaki is getting the ordinary moviegoer who may not even know about the horrors of the pacific theater to cheer for the japanese to become a militarized nation again by emphasizing their humanity against oversized primordial monsters human monstrosities are hidden from view japan has delivered inconsistent apologies for its torture of children and women whom they had the nerve to call comfort women war supplies public toilets or female ammunition right wing elements in japan try to suppress this history and claim it never happened they even demand that other countries comply with their demands to take down statues memorializing their victims if this movie existed outside of this push for revisionist history alternate history would be understandable because not every movie about japan must be a downer but there should be some concern that our mindless monster movie may have a hidden agenda which outsiders are oblivious to godzilla minus one gets awkward as the narrative trajectory finds everyone rooting for koichi to become a sincere kamikaze pilot again yamazaki deserves credit for finding a way that does not feel overtly orwellian to reverse the essence of being a kamikaze in the twentieth century context without reverting to its origins ie  divine wind or used to describe a typhoon that scattered attacking kublai khans fleet of ships in the thirteenth century redefining kamikazes meaning is consistent with his rehabilitation of japan by erasing history and feels like cheating but as long as there is room for a sequel which there is maybe the next iteration will be less problematic so everyone can enjoy the monster mash spectacle in peace
Mar 29 2024,positive,imagine asking not how cool would it be if rather how can our monster test our fullyrealized human characters and how can we use our monster as a tool of social commentary a means to explore and critique aspects of the culture that created it 
Mar 21 2024,positive,godzillas properly menacing the emotional moments work and it makes you excited to see what toho has coming next
Mar 12 2024,positive, while it might have felt like the cinema of 2023 was all about barbie and the bomb there were plenty of other films that likewise made their marks whether critically commercially or controversially here then are my picks for the 10 best movies of 2023 followed by 10 worthy runnersup and other assorted superlatives 1 poor things yorgos lanthimos the best film of 2023 working from alasdair grays samenamed novel director yorgos lanthimos whose 2018 release the favourite earned my vote as the best picture of that year go here and screenwriter tony mcnamara have fashioned a true oddity a frankenstein meets forrest gump flick filtered through a feminist focus emma stone taking a bold leap up to the level of todays greatest actresses stars as bella a suicide victim whos brought back to life in the most fantastical way by quirky scientist godwin baxter willem dafoe under the tutelage of godwin the childlike bella receives an education within the strict confines of home but as she matures she realizes she wants to explore the outside world and thus she takes off with a seedy lawyer a hilarious mark ruffalo growing ever more bold as she samples lifes perils and pleasures and in the process discovers her true self to say that poor things isnt for everyone is an understatement yet those willing to go along for the sometimes gross yet always giddy ride will experience a movie that much like barbie illustrates how a woman who knows nothing of our worlds crippling problems and prejudices might carve her own path in pursuit of becoming fully human and fully independent 2 the holdovers alexander payne no stranger to my 10 best lists  the descendants was my 1 for 2011 while 2004s sideways and 1999s election also placed extremely high  director alexander payne working with scripter david hemingson serves up a smallscale gem that by utilizing a 1970s setting manages to recall the intimate cinema of that period paul giamatti is perfect as paul hunham a grouchy professor at a new england prep school despised by practically everyone hes given the unenviable task of looking after a group of kids with nowhere to go over the christmas break when hes not hanging out with the school cook davine joy randolph matching her marvelous performance in dolemite is my name hes spending time with the most troubled of the students dominic sessa an actual new england prep school student making a remarkable film debut full of humor and pathos this is one of those unassuming treats that overpowers the viewer with its enormous humanist bent 3 all of us strangers andrew haigh no movie from 2022 emotionally wiped me out as much as charlotte wells aftersun and no movie from 2023 emotionally wiped me out as much as andrew haighs all of us strangers paul mescal proves to be the connective tissue delivering a performance in aftersun that earned him a best actor oscar nomination hes in support here the star is sherlock and fleabag regular andrew scott in a performance that should have earned him but didnt a best actor oscar nomination scott offers a wonderfully nuanced turn as a gay writer who sees dead people  namely the parents jamie bell and claire foy who died in a car crash when he was a child his time with his folks is intercut with time spent with his equally lonely neighbor mescal but its not long before the two worlds converge rich in meaning and metaphor and open to various interpretations this is a rueful and haunting study about letting people in and letting people go 4 oppenheimer christopher nolan it was quite gratifying to see that both halves of the barbenheimer phenomenon lived up to the hype with the approving frenzy so earpiercingly loud that it probably belonged in an imax production directed by christopher nolan while barbie offers sunshine and rainbow colors to go with its satiric and social themes oppenheimer understandably hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues cillian murphy is excellent as j robert oppenheimer the physicist whose work on the manhattan project led to the creation of the atom bomb  as for the allstar cast surrounding him emily blunt robert downey jr etc nolan hasnt merely collected alisters as if they were baseball cards but instead employs their characters to help round out oppenheimers story in the process lending greater import and understanding to the thorny proceedings 5 are you there god its me margaret kelly fremon craig based on judy blumes landmark novel this focuses on 11yearold margaret simon abby ryder fortson and the circumstances that arise when her mom a phenomenal rachel mcadams and dad benny safdie decide to relocate from nyc to a new jersey suburb with the full backing of blume writerdirector kelly fremon craig the edge of seventeen has fashioned a splendid comingofage film thats both sensitive and perceptive  it steers clear of condescension meanspiritedness and glib humor in order to truly understand the tribulations of not just margaret but also her friends and family this unfortunately proved to be a commercial underachiever  given what was dominating the box office at the time perhaps they should have renamed it are you there mario its me luigi 6 american fiction cord jefferson a formidable actor who has lent his support to everyone from james bond to katniss everdeen jeffrey wright finally lands the leading role of his career in this black comedy about black literature wright delivers a beautiful slowburn performance as thelonious monk ellison an academic author whose novels are rejected for not being black enough after another scribe issa rae hits it big with a book called wes lives in da ghetto a frustrated monk writes a deliberately pandering novel in the guise of a fictional former convict stagg r leigh from the similarly titled blues folk song and then is flabbergasted when its a success few films from 2023 can match this one for sizable belly laughs but the guffaws never obfuscate the issues at hand particularly the reductiveness and stereotyping of the black experience in america 7 barbie greta gerwig whats left to say about this cultural tsunami a zeitgeist rattler so potent that even the usual armies of mras couldnt disturb one strand of hair on its perfectly coifed head not that they didnt try see the fox news rants as well as all those down votes on imdb writerdirector greta gerwig and coscripter noah baumbach have created a colorful confection that benefits from the inspired casting of margot robbie and ryan gosling as barbie and just ken the laughs are plentiful  some of the years biggest nyuks can be found in its digs at film school grads justice league fanboys and matchbox twenty  but what makes barbie truly work is its deft tackling of themes like existential crises toxic masculinity feminist selfworth overarching capitalism and the dangers of both the patriarchy and the matriarchy the latter a key point conveniently ignored by the whiny detractors 8 the taste of things trần anh hùng i certainly didnt expect a porn flick to land on this list yet here we are to clarify i mean food porn like babettes feast eat drink man woman and others this is the sort of film where one can get aroused not only by the mouthwatering shots of delectable cuisine but also by the filmmakers ability to allow the gastronomy and the philosophy to commingle think of it as the art of the meal titled la passion de dodin bouffant in its french homeland this lovely effort from frenchvietnamese director trần anh hùng centers on a 19thcentury gourmet benoît magimel and the woman juliette binoche who has served as his cook and lover for 20 years i suppose the central romances in fallen leaves and past lives might hold slightly more urgency and currency but those films didnt offer costarring roles to a volauvent and a baked alaska 9 the teachers lounge ilker çatak movies have long employed the high school to serve as a microcosm of an ailing society at large and this german import can proudly and profoundly be added to the ledger that also includes the likes of election brick and the underrated teachers a middle school harbors a thief from within and the teachers automatically assume a student is the culprit but when an idealistic teacher leonie benesch arrives at a different conclusion and reports her findings all hell breaks loose as tense as any thriller this slowly and masterfully introduces a host of realworld problems into its storyline including the tendency of people to offer opinions without all the facts the employment of social media to distort and distract and the blurring of lines between ostensible heroes and villains the nonending is a letdown but everything else merits a circled red a 10 saltburn emerald fennell certainly it doesnt feel like this divisive effort from writerdirector emerald fennell whose promising young woman was my pick for the best film of 2020 go here should be placed above some of the heavy hitters cited on my honorable mentions list below and those folks who groused about this largely being a ripoff of the talented mr ripley werent entirely incorrect yet theres something to be said about movies that take root in the minds eye and refuse to leave and this one has lingered more than many on this list this story about a young man barry keoghan worming his way into an aristocratic familys everyday existence is occasionally predictable but the daring nature of fennells approach the spectacular visual palate and keoghans lettingitallhangout literally performance are anything but pat its gothic stateliness by way of goth subculture  enter at your own risk 2023 movie im most sorry to have seen the killer i was initially going to go with the exorcist believer but since it was from the writer of halloween ends and firestarter it probably never stood a chance of being watchable to anyone but the easily startled the killer on the other hand hails from david fincher whos made a few fine movies seven the social network over the decades this dismal dud isnt one of them it plays like a john wick flick for people who think theyre too good for a john wick flick and the problem with michael fassbenders borderline incompetent assassin isnt that hes unappealing but that hes a boring zero 2023 movie im least sorry to have missed rebel moon part one  a child of fire since it was made by a pair of qanon nutjobs i was initially going to go with sound of freedom but why give them even the time of day rebel moon on the other hand hails from zack snyder who actually directed a pair of decent movies dawn of the dead watchmen decades ago but has been flailing since so if even the fanboys who worshipped the silly sucker punch the miserable man of steel and that excruciating 15hour cut of justice league are turning their noses up at this one then it must be a real stinker for now i guess rebel moon part two  the scargiver has dibs on 2024 movie im least sorry to have missed none of the reviews of anatomy of a fall mention the extraordinary performance of the young actor who plays daniel the son of sandra hillers character what is his name
Mar 12 2024,positive,a surprisingly emotional melodrama bolsters what may stand as the most enjoyable godzilla movie ever made in yamazakis call back to the nuclear creatures origins 
Feb 6 2024,positive, next month hollywoods latest godzilla movie will hit theaters titled godzilla x kong the new empire it will join warner bros monsterverse a glitzy american spin on a formula that toho pictures began in 1954 with the original godzilla the film features a fearsome monster doing battle with king kong and other beasts while an allstar cast looks on in horror but although hollywoods approach to translating the monster has relied on pure silly spectacleunderstandable for a series about a nuclear lizard beast smashing citiesjapan has of late found new and original angles on its kaiju hero the newest godzilla minus one was good enough to draw a surprising amount of attention in the us a signal that domestic audiences are open to highconcept spins on familiar characters made to celebrate the franchises 70th anniversary godzilla minus one is the creation of the japanese auteur takashi yamazaki a visualeffects innovator with a long run of success in his country the original godzilla tapped into japans anxieties about nuclear fallout after hiroshima and nagasaki godzilla minus one takes place from 1945 to 1947 in the immediate aftermath of japans surrender despair and loss pervade the film the protagonist is kōichi shikishima played by ryunosuke kamiki a pilot struggling with survivors guilt from making it through both the war and an attack from a notyetfullygrown godzilla who destroyed a military base where he was stationed kōichi is haunted by his cowardice in the face of the monster and by the wartime devastation of tokyo which has left him without a home or family he takes up with a woman named noriko minami hamabe and a child named akiko sae nagataniboth also orphaned by the warand becomes a minesweeper trawling the sea for unexploded ordinance with other disaffected veterans into this uneasy present wanders godzilla now gigantic and mutated by nuclear testing over his 70 years of stardom godzilla has been variously depicted as a rampaging destructive force in the early films an evolutionary system keeping the world in balance and an avenging angel doing battle with even worse monsters his films broken into different eras with loose continuity range from horrifying to goofily camp but his portrayal in godzilla minus one might be the most terrifying ive ever seen onscreenhes not just shambling through buildings and stomping on cars hes wrecking city blocks with singular purpose his atomic breath a mainstay of the series since the beginning is represented by yamazaki as a pulverizing nuclear blast that creates new mushroom clouds on the horizon its scary ive seen plenty of godzilla movies and enjoyed most of them but the title character has rarely been so frightening to behold of the american attempts gareth edwardss 2014 godzilla came closest by emphasizing the scale of the creature shrouding him in darkness and doling out his terrible roar with admirable restraint though i like that film the humans in it are either boring or plainly risible a problem in many a godzillawhile the monster spectacle may draw in viewers godzilla himself takes up only a slim chunk of a run time largely devoted to people running around in awe and horror that is why godzilla minus one is a great film rather than merely an impressive feat of monstrous visual effects although those were justly oscarnominated last month the first time a japanese film has received a nod in that category kōichi is not just a cipher who exists to move the narrative along his personal guilt and sense of hopelessness about japans future are successfully entwined with the wider destruction being wrought by the monster kōichis crew of misfit survivors on the minesweeper ship portrayed by a charming bunch of veteran japanese character actors are all clinging to vague hope as they look for a way to stop godzilla yamazaki has said that he saw modern parallels in his story too particularly in the national sense of confusion and futility during the early months of covid whether you focus on the historical analogy or the contemporary one the point of godzilla minus one is the same triumphing over the monster is less about destroying him and more about finding the will to live after a great cataclysm these are deeply affecting emotional stakes and they help the film stand as an impressive counter to the previous godzilla film released by toho pictures hideki anno and shinji higuchis brilliant shin godzilla which was a baldfaced satire of modern governmental incompetence in the face of a kaiju attack viewed back to back the films reveal how impressively versatile the series can still be they also make hollywoods endless slapfest between godzilla and king kong or a slew of other anonymous monsters feel even more juvenile godzilla minus one was warmly received in japan and its american reception has been especially surprising on top of the oscar nomination the film has grossed 56 million in the us by far the most for a japanese godzilla moviein comparison shin godzilla made just under 2 millionand the thirdmost of any foreign film in history its theatrical run concluded last week with a terrific blackandwhite version that further emphasized yamazakis despairing tone godzilla x kong will storm into theaters next month and should stir up plenty of ticket sales on its own but as audiences understand how artfully made and visually arresting these movies can be they may lose interest in the corny american knockoffs
Jan 25 2024,positive, post war japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb when godzilla first destroyed tokyo in 1954 he was a metaphor for japans recent atomic terrors despite many outings since rarely has he been as terrifying until now godzilla minus one refreshes this original tale and crucially remembers that it should be a horror movie despite this japanese productions small budget by hollywood standards at least writerdirector takashi yamazaki shows off the scaly beasts carnage as inventively as possible even when godzilla isnt on screen tension still builds fans of jaws may recognise certain tricks the human cast is excellent too led by ryunosuke kamiki as kamikaze pilot koichi shikishima stumbling into a godzilla attack at the start of the film his cowardice costs lives so when the creature stirs again a few years later shikishima has a chance to redeem himself and save his new family but can he face his greatest fear a tough call as this godzilla is an elemental uncaring force a manifestation of japans darkest psychology just as he should be
Jan 25 2024,positive,but the horror or evil in godzilla minus one isnt limited to the big gs rampages indeed takashi yamazakis monster is a secondary source of trauma and the attendant destruction is dwarfed by the war which immediately preceded his attacks 
Jan 22 2024,positive, if you enjoy adventure films with a combination of intense action and dramatic flair godzilla minus one might be the movie for you directed by japanese filmmaker takashi yamazaki the film offers a visceral and fastpaced fantasy with striking visuals and a strong sense of conviction yamazaki employs blockbuster tactics to depict multiple dangerous situations with a radioactive godzilla wreaking havoc on a postwar japan  the story revolves around koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a former kamikaze pilot turned deserter and seamine extractor his lack of courage brings shame to many of his fellow countrymen however when he encounters noriko oishi and her rescued orphan baby he discovers a new purpose in life as godzilla heads to tokyo koichi sees an opportunity to redeem himself and prove his bravery and piloting skills the film explores strong antipatriotic sentiments associated with the loss of war mixed with a sense of unity among a group of civilians led by former naval weapons engineer and strategist kenji noda hidetaka yoshioka despite some plot holes and sentimental moments yamazaki enhances the film with stylized visuals wellcomposed frames and knockout sequences that blend ferocity with desolation the director bends the rules of the genre by providing reinforced visual effects and relying on an intense musical score while godzillas new roar is a result of a simple amplification of the original the overall experience feels fresh and new
Jan 19 2024,positive, godzilla has forever been misunderstood not in the sense that the giant lizard was right to wreak havoc on the people of japan but rather that in the transition to hollywood many iterations of the character seemed to lose sight of what ishirō hondas 1954 classic stood for in the first place naturally you cant have a godzilla film without sequences of mass destruction buildings effortlessly knocked over as if they were made out of paper people fleeing for their lives under the feet of a gargantuan beast that threatens their very existence but the character has always carried with it something more hondas original creation was more akin to an elegy a haunting film brought about by the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 the monster itself is an allegory for the aftermath fast forward a few decades and most peoples understanding of the character is giant monster fighting other giant monsters helped by the ongoing monsterverse from warner bros and legendary this didnt stop toho the studio behind every japanese godzilla film since 1954 from continuing the legacy they started the critical and commercial success of shin godzilla in 2016 proved there was still a place for the traditional godzilla film bringing us up to the release of takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one boasting more in common with hondas film than recent iterations like 2021s godzilla vs kong minus one brings us back to the franchises roots marked by its postwar japan setting established in the shocking almost spielbergian opening similarities to that iconic trex scene in jurassic park are absolutely valid the focus of the story here is not the titular monster but rather failed kamikaze pilot kōichi shikishima whose first encounter with the monster leaves him haunted by the ghosts of the attack on a japanese base on odo island upon returning home japan is at zero cities left in ruin families destroyed with no hope left for the future shikishima begins working as a minesweeper while helping to support noriko ōishi a young woman whose family died in the war and the orphaned child she rescued from the rubble as the years pass however it becomes clear that what shikishima saw of godzilla was only the beginning its truly astonishing to see what has been achieved here on simply a surface level in an age where blockbusters are costing more and more to produce multiple examples from 2023 alone include new entries in the indiana jones and antman franchises yamazaki manages to craft one of the most aesthetically striking blockbusters of the past few years on a budget equivalent to just 15 million the sense of scale created here cannot be understated the action sequences are thrilling and monstrously terrifying with the titular monster portrayed in a way that feels both familiar and totally unlike anything youve seen before thanks to some astounding vfx work from the nightmarish latenight attack on odo island that opens the film to the unforgettable ginza set piece that sees trains flung across the city and buildings obliterated in brutal fashion theres no shortage of thrilling action to keep you clutching your arm rests but what really sets minus one apart from its american predecessors is the amount of focus it places on its human characters as opposed to being solely monster focused instead of reducing the humans to nothing but cannon fodder they are all injected with a poignant humanity that elevates an already impressive film in dealing with the trauma of the japanese people after world war ii yamazakis film makes for a compelling companion piece not just to the original godzilla from 1954 but also the more recent oppenheimer the character drama is just as striking as the nightmarish sequences of devastation shikishimas inner battle as a disgraced kamikaze pilot dealing with a lifetime of guilt takes centre stage as his revenge against godzilla becomes the end goal of his redemption a deeply emotional arc that acts as the beating heart of the film oddly enough however in bringing the franchise back to its roots there are many moments throughout minus ones runtime that are frankly a little too derivative of hondas film right down to its similar story beats but never to the point where the immersion is broken and this just speaks to the sheer quality on display here with the excitement towards franchises like the mcu beginning to dwindle godzilla minus one is looking like a ray of hope for the future its an unexpected gem one of the most exhilarating pulsepounding blockbusters to hit the big screen in quite some time packed with so much genuine heart to make it stand out among the onslaught of generic actioners and cinematic universes that seem to be dominating the multiplexes today most importantly it makes clear the staying power of godzilla as a franchise where filmmakers are still finding new ways to bring the monster to the big screen in a way that is both endlessly thrilling and emotionally affecting gemma creagh is a writer filmmaker and journalist in 2014 she graduated with a first from nuigs ma writing programme gemmas play spoiling sunset was staged in

Jan 11 2024,positive,late to this party but really admire the thought  karmic energy in the film both with godzilla easter eggs  the allegory of japans sad legacy in world war 2 goes much deeper into the godzilla mythos than ever before while remaining true gogo g
Jan 10 2024,positive, when ishirō honda and eiji tsuburayas singular creation godzilla gojira shuffled out of the ocean depths in 1954 little did they know that their gigantic atomic firebreathing monstera monstrous metaphor for nuclear devastationwould be celebrating its 70th anniversary next year given godzillas protean ability to morph with changing trends and newer audiences its more than likely that audiences in 2094 or their posthuman equivalent will be not just celebrating the king of the monsterss 140th anniversary but also looking forward to the next halfcentury and beyond subsequent sequels remakes and reboots including the ongoing americanmade bigbudget monsterverse series naturally kickstarted by godzilla 2014 never fully recaptured the horrors and terrors of the 1954 japanese original until now that is and writerdirectorvisualeffectsguru takashi yamazakis ghost book the great war of archimedes reboot godzilla minus one at times startlingly downbeat and crushingly bleak at others uplifting and optimistic yamazaki delivers a multilayered tonally perfect provocative take on godzilla and postwwii japan in yamazakis hands godzilla feels almost entirely new both as a terrible force of nature and destruction and as an allpurpose metaphor that can change with the times and its all thanks to yamazaki and his collaborators on both sides of the camera godzilla minus one opens in 1945 during the closing days of world war ii japans defeat isnt a matter of if anymore but when for koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot with wavering loyalties and a keen instinct for selfpreservation throwing his life away on a lost cause seems like a deeply unwise illogical decision landing on a japaneseheld island for repairs on his faulty plane koichi hopes against hope to avoid his fate or barring the fate the japanese military has set for him and others like him another day or halfday of life the airplane techs on the island greet koichi with wariness and some doubt but before they can act on those doubts the title character appears wreaking havoc on the airfield and worse yet leaving only koichi and the chief mechanic sōsaku tachibana munetaka aoki alive not surprisingly tachibana blames koichi for hesitating when he should have attempted to engage godzilla koichi would have failed of course but tachibana stubbornly rejects the possibility leaving koichi with the equivalent of badges of dishonor photos of the dead men as a reminder of koichis failure of nerve after his brief terrifying attack in the prologue the title character hovers offscreen for the better part of another 3040 minutes before returning for several command performances each one both different than the last and brilliantly staged by yamazaki and his team with godzilla temporarily offscreen yamazaki focuses on koichi and his painful anguished reintegration into society marked as a coward andby at least one neighbor a traitor to japankoichis deepseated emotional and psychological struggles take centre stage across godzilla minus ones remaining running time koichis arc follows a notentirelypredictable character from a onetime pilot once driven by nationalism and cultural attitudes about collectivism and selfsacrifice to one driven by a straightforward cleareyed ideal sacrificing himself for a greater good that greater good for koichi includes noriko oishi minami hamabe a young woman who follows koichi home one day and akiko sae nagatani an infant survivor noriko saved from almost certain death connected by need and not biology koichi noriko and akiko form a makeshift familyfirst by default later by intention still haunted by his actions during the war koichi remains at a physical and emotional distance even as he turns into a good provider for their family by getting a wellpaying job aboard a minesweeper which slowly improves their fortunes koichi cant bring himself to ask for more from noriko while godzilla represents a far greater danger one defined not by ideological fervor but by pure instinct yamazakis implicit worldview leads him to turn godzilla minus one into a celebration of the generation that survived the horrors of wwii some admittedly selfinflicted though that admission appears nowhere here and the seemingly infinite resilience needed to rebuild postwar japan taking a deeper dive into godzilla minus one however and yamazakis critique of the japanese government before during and after the war isnt anywhere as clear and nonambiguous as it first appears yamazaki skirts an incredibly fine line allowing moviegoers to make the films themes fit whatever preconceptions or biases they had before entering the theatre multiple times several characters express their bitterness either at the slowmoving inefficient bureaucracy that hinders their efforts to stop godzilla after it makes landfall in tokyo or at their conduct of the war the latter can be read as either criticism of the japanese government for bringing japan into a destructive war or their incompetent management of the war leading to inevitable defeat wherever the characters stand ideologically on the justconcluded war they ultimately set aside their differences and unite to defeat the existential threat presented by godzilla and its atomic breath yamazaki celebrates both unity and more importantly collective actionfree of bothersome government interference no lesswhen koichi his minesweeper buddies and exnavy men agree to participate in an ingenious plan concocted by kenji noda hidetaka yoshioka a brainy exnavy engineer and one of koichis minesweeper compatriots that in turn leads to a nerveshredding set piece that easily qualifies as bestinclassor among bestinclassacross godzillas 70 years and nearly 40 films godzilla minus one sets the concluding decisive battle on the water the motley assortment of decommissioned ships merchant vessels and tug boats the last defence against a rampaging godzilla yamazaki uses every cinematic tool available to deliver a harrowingly intense spectaclerich experience on par with its biggerbudgeted american counterparts as the battle progresses toward its inevitable climax yamazaki nimbly crosscuts between multiple ships their respective crews and koichi in fullon redemption mode in those last stirring riveting moments of godzilla minus one yamazakis overarching theme that only collective actiona renewed nationalism separated from from the selfdestructive politics of imperial japancan defeat an existential threat like godzilla fully comes into focus as weve repeatedly learned in the past however any rumours of godzillas demise remain if nothing else exaggerated all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not my mother a hole in the ground and men in this unboxing video jason gorber checks out the joni mitchell archives volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this

Jan 9 2024,positive, not only was godzilla minus one one of the best movies ive watched in years we absolutely deserved that happy ending this is coming from someone who understands that creatives in hollywood or in the film industry love a sad ending you know what im talking about one that rips out your heart and is supposed to make you think about the beauty of life blah blah blah and i think its simply not sustainable or realistic if were going to spend a lot of time honoring or featuring sad endings that speak to the harsh realities of our world its important to also highlight the good and the ending that we got in godzilla minus one was an amazing one that showed the power of the human spirit and how the choices we make have consequences that last  overall i feel like this movie honored the spirit of godzilla for the last couple of years hollywood has released or tried to build a world for godzilla that revamps them but by doing so i feel like they have ignored the origins of this iconic monster hollywoods version of godzilla is basically the michael bay version there are explosions fights and a bunch of big epic moments thats not the godzilla that i grew up with sure there was destruction but there was always a deeper meaning and understanding of godzilla as a symbol of the consequences of war radiation and human hubris and i think hollywood has never understood that or respected it thats not to say i dont like the hollywood versions besides the apple tv show i do but they dont understand who godzilla truly is minus one built a world that was grounded in loss and grief on one hand you have shikishima he went off to fight a war and ended up being a deserter and his fear which was totally justified led to a mountain of guilt that he didnt step up and help when godzilla was attacking the island he landed on he took that with him when he went back home and discovered that his entire family was gone and he continued to carry that as he met noriko and inadvertently started a family with her his grief felt real complicated and the kind of thing that doesnt go away over time its something that you have to face and work through and i think that he worked through all of that to end up where he did at the end of the movie we also have noriko she also lost everything and found a lifeline in akiko and shikishima one ended up being her child and the reason why she kept fighting every single day when the world was just torn apart around them and the other ended up being her partner and someone to help carry the load of raising a child the notable difference with shikishima is that she helped him more when it came to his grief she willingly did it because she cared but it got to the point where she realized that you can only help someone so much and that she has to do things for herself that right there takes strength and if i had any complaint about her character is that i would have loved to see more of her grief at losing her family while watching godzilla minus one i got this feeling that they would end up together i liked that they formed this little family that they help each other carry the load of this new world and that noriko drew a line in the sand with shikishima and when we thought that noriko was dead and that he would follow her i grieved i grieved for her but also for what they could have had color me surprised that by the end of it shikishima survived and was on his way to living a life that he chose and on his terms and color me even more shocked when ota came with akiko sharing a shocking revelation that ended up being that noriko was alive personally i loved this ending and as soon as i watched it i ran to twitter to see if others agreed with me they didnt a lot of people were saying that it took away from the meaning and the spirit of the movie that both of them survived and i disagree wholeheartedly a happily ever after is just as powerful as an ending where both of them are one of them died and i think that a happy ending feels more realistic for the journeys that the characters went on the rug wasnt pulled out from underneath them this ending felt earned and like both of them could start a new phase of their lives after processing their grief both of them being dead or one of them being dead would just slap on more grief and ignore what happened during the movie even more so im kind of tired of women being fridged for the character arc of a man this movie dabbled with that concept by making us believe that noriko was dead and i didnt like it bringing her back or revealing that she was alive even though she has some sort of infection on her neck that alludes to more to come honors who she is and how her story plays into the overall story of godzilla minus one it shows her importance and how she will be a continued part of this world and if we do get a second part to this movie that shows what is going on with her neck i hope that its done from a perspective where shikishima supports her and we end up focusing more on her journey because she is of value and super interesting as a character i even liked that godzilla is not totally dead at the ending godzilla is everlasting and continues to come back for more no matter what happens they are a reminder of the hubris of humans and how they think they can conquer nature or do things to nature with no consequences but they are also a cycle of life and how in reality we go through ups and downs that come back to haunt us when we least expect and i think that godzilla will come back for noriko and shikishima or they will come back for whatever descendants of my new otp and just like before godzilla will be conquered and humans will live to fight another day understanding that their actions or the actions of other humans brought them here agree wholeheartedly with you it was good that she did survive and whats wrong with having happy endings in movies goodness knows that we dont have enough of them in this chaotic world of ours besides isnt movies about escapism
Jan 9 2024,positive, in the seven decades since ishirō hondas 1954 classic godzilla kicked off the durable genre of the kaiju or giant monster movie this fearsome megareptile a prehistoric creature summoned from the depths of the sea by atomic radiation has stomped chomped and firebreathed his way through 38 movies not to mention countless comic books and video games he has battled king kong a threeheaded dragon and a benevolent gargantuan moth and he has even been known to fight alongside the human race against a common enemy in writerdirector takashi yamazakis remarkable godzilla minus one the venerable behemoth returns to his roots once again serving as an embodiment of japans anxiety about nuclear weapons in the aftermath of world war ii but yamazaki also brings something new to the godzillaverse a more modern understanding of and profound sensitivity to human psychological states like posttraumatic stress disorder and survivors guilt as well as a critique of the nationalist machismo that shaped japanese soldiers attitude toward their role in the war its the rare kaiju movie that cares this deeply about the inner lives and motivations of the people scurrying out of the way of the monsters ginormous thudding feet in 1945 koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a young kamikaze pilot lands his plane on a small island devoted to military aircraft repairs a mechanic munetaka aoki suspects that koichi is only faking his planes technical problems so as to avoid flying an inevitably deadly mission that night the monster of the title emerges from the sea to wreak havoc on the island encampment and everyone is killed except for the mechanic and koichi who when called upon to unload his planes weapons on the beast instead freezes in fear racked by shame and guilt koichi returns to his home in tokyo where his neighborhood has been reduced to rubble and both his parents killed amid the wreckage koichi crosses paths with a young woman noriko minami hamabe who has taken in a baby after the childs mother died in an air raid though he initially resists the responsibility of taking them in koichi cannot bring himself to leave these two to their fate and the three become a kind of ad hoc family as tokyo begins the painful process of reconstruction steven spielberg has cited the original godzilla as a major influence and in godzilla minus one yamazaki returns the favor after his return to tokyo koichi takes a job on a minesweeping boat tasked with finding and blowing up the remaining ordnance in the sea off the japanese coast the small crew on this rust bucketan oldsalt captain a brainy naval engineer and a young sailor who wishes he too could have served in the warcant help but evoke the threemenonaboat finale of jaws soon after koichi joins them the boats crew encounters the colossus at sea now mutated to be even more powerful thanks to the atomic tests at bikini atoll in a juryrigged operation that again recalls a certain shark movie and that is staged with similar panache by yamazaki the boats crew devises a plan to make the creature swallow a mine which they will then detonate in its mouth it works but to their horror they realize that the leviathan has developed powers of selfregeneration throughout the movie but most especially in this first sea battle the monster is rendered with a solidity that recalls the suitmation technique of early godzilla films though hes a cgi creation his towering bulk and the craggy texture of his skin feel scarily palpable its only a matter of time before godzilla has reached dry land storming through the tokyo neighborhood of ginza while munching the cars of an elevated train as if they were a string of linked sausages godzilla minus onethe title comes from the notion that postwar japan had been set back to zero with the arrival of the beast pushing the counter into the negativeunderstands better than any movie ive seen in ages how to balance big action sequences with quiet character moments for those used to americanstyle blockbusters the lizardfree stretches may seem unusually extended between koichis first encounter with the monster and his second two full years go by the passage of time indicated not by a quick onscreen legend but by a series of smallscale scenes between the human characters even if he had never laid eyes on an enormous prehistoric monster koichi would be contending with a powerful internal conflict his deep guilt at having survived the war when so many he loved didnt which he regards not as a sign of resilience but of cowardice kamikis anguished vulnerable performance is one crucial part of what makes this protagonist so memorable but an equally important element is the sheer amount of time that yamazakis script allows him to fret about things other than radioactive reptiles how to earn a living in a warravaged economy for example or whether he is ready to accept the love that noriko and their adopted daughter are so eager to give him in the five weeks since its us release godzilla minus one has crushed the box office under its mighty foot not via the power of hype but through oldfashioned positive word of mouth made for a relatively modest budget of around 15 millionless than a tenth of the budget of the 2021 hollywood installment godzilla vs kongit has become not only the most successful godzilla film ever to come out of japan but the highestgrossing liveaction japanese movie of all time lest the abovepraised attention to character development and emotional nuance make it sound like an arty snooze rest assured that godzilla minus one remains a rollicking action spectacle with a series of thrillingly crafted set pieces several of which make judicious but clever use of akira ifukubes original godzilla theme one of the most recognizable music cues in movie history come for the skylinedestroying radioactive dino stay for the delicately etched portrait of recovery and selfforgiveness or vice versa just dont miss the chance to remind yourself why the world fell for godzilla in the first place
Jan 8 2024,negative, as someone who typically doesnt enjoy monster movies i realize that i am not a member of the target audience for godzilla minus one as a critic its my job to be objective when evaluating a piece of cinema and very little about this film worked for me while i admire writer  director takashi yamazakis ambitious vision of making a godzilla film with a more humanfocused story i found it difficult to form an emotional attachment to any of the characters combined with the forced acting and sluggish pacing almost everything about the movie is painfully dull near the end of world war ii in 1945 a kamikaze pilot ryunosuke kamiki lands on a japanese base on odo island a mechanic munetaka aoki assumes that the man has fled his duty by claiming his aircraft is suffering from a technical problem later that evening a terrifying creature emerges from the ocean and attacks already devastated by the war japan faces a new crisis in the form of a giant lizard monster called godzilla with the exception of the opening godzilla attack the narrative setup is slow which will disappoint those expecting an action packed monster movie not that this is a bad thing but be aware this is a more emotionally heavy godzilla movie there are some action scenes with mayhem and destruction that top out at just okay and the tone abruptly shifts towards the dramatic the cgi effects are decent but certainly not mindblowing and there are times when godzilla looks like hes stepped out of a secondrate video game he is goofy looking with a cheesy grin and a big round belly which makes him more laughable than formidable which is a problem in a monster movie the end fight to defeat godzilla is the most exciting part of the movie because everybody loves a hero but the dramatic elements of the film feel manufactured and fake cue the ridiculously hokey happy ending especially when i felt zero emotional investment in the characters godzilla minus one doesnt have the universal appeal that it so desperately needs i am not and have never been a fan of godzilla and this film did nothing to make me one well thank you very much i do like to think im funny and your witty insightful comment gave me the confident boost i didnt need  thanks for taking the time to comment sure wish youd let me know what you thought of the movie rather than hurling simplistic insults but you do you ricardo  well it won for best special effects at the oscars so mediocre video game effects is certainly not a good fit anymore also please explain forced acting because i didnt see that all i saw was a different culture well played on that type of stage the academy gets it wrong a lot i expected more hate mail after the win tonight oppenheimer deserved the oscar in that category look minus one just didnt work for me i found it exaggerated and boring its my job to express how i feel about a certain film and thats how i feel about it even after a second viewing i am so glad it resonated with and worked for so many people but i just dont think its a good film  sometimes its the individual that gets it wrong even with the best intentions it doesnt matter if something fits your personal tastes what matters is contributing positive consideration for a film that does not fit your tastes but is still a worthy piece especially for the limited resources and different culture involved i think you watched a different film than most of us  the ending superficially might be happy but its not i guess you werent paying attention  the pacing is amazing if you think its slow i recommend avoiding seven samurai as you will find that a real snoozefest for an action film funny you mention seven samurai its one of my alltime favorites so happy minus one worked so well for you it certainly didnt for me thanks for taking the time to comment i appreciate you sharing your thoughts i appreciate your timely response without knowing the genre however i would imagine this film might be hard to approach  it harkens back to the original 1954 gojira for its solemn tone  im still surprised at your pacing comment  pre atomic godzilla shows up no more than 8 minutes into the film and more or less serves as a slingshot to propel the story forward much like the initial attack on chrissie in spielbergs jaws 1975  narratively minus one shares more than a few similarities with jaws actually the opening attack is fun enough but then i thought the pacing dropped dramatically as the narrative is set up i didnt find the characters interesting or even that sympathetic but im so glad you did i know a lot of people loved this movie and thats really cool  with the exception of the first 8 minutes i found the film to be incredibly tedious slow and boring the ending was so bad and i was indeed paying attention i never change an opinion for hits or clicks but i am firm and confident in my opinions on films i am so glad minus one worked so well for you but it was a complete dud for me thats what makes art so great  its beauty is in the eye of the beholder thanks again for taking the time to share your comments  i felt that way about everything everywhere all at once i absolutely hated it but so many seemed to love it the filmmakers went to my alma mater and when they won the oscar people came out of the woodwork to ask if i was excited a couple of emerson graduates had won  i always think somethings wrong with me that some movies just dont resonate at all when so many others love them i am a huge scifi fan but have literally hated every star wars film ive seen my favorite film  annihilation  seem to be polarizing as well all that said i absolutely loved this film saw it again last night this time in black  white and i have to say it was even better minus color godzilla minus one poorly paced poor characters and mediocre cg but barbie and the marvels those are good yeah i think i can tell why you maybe didnt care for it if those movies are considered good by your standards fair point but i wasnt over the moon about barbie or the marvels either i just found them to be slightly fresh for rt at least i wasnt bored thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts  theres nothing fresh about either of those movies but they check certain boxes for certain people so thats why they get a pass from critics that other movies dont i wont say godzilla minus one isnt without flaws but theres far more quality and craft put into it for its budget than either barbie or the marvels or half the garbage put out by hollywood you finding it boring doesnt change the fact that every character is set up and pays off by the movies end storytelling 101 seriously  so not enough car chases and silly slowmo fight sequences for you  you shouldnt be reviewing films because obviously you have no clue what a good one is thank you for taking the time to comment everyone has different perspectives and preferences on movies and im so glad minus one worked for you do you have any other movies that you think are good was wondering if we agreed on any titles because ill bet we do  sz i think youre in a very small minority regarding this film of course you could still be right but i think you should ask why your take on gm1 is swimming so much against the stream what is everybody else getting that you arent personally i found it an excellent blend of spectacle and human drama once in a while i am thoroughly shocked and surprised that my take on a movie is so different than everyone elses it hasnt happened often but it does happen i even tried to go back and rewatch minus one and i still was bored by it something about the story simply doesnt resonate with me thank you for taking the time to comment and share your thoughts  thanks for taking the time to comment although i certainly wish youd contributed to the discussion on the film in some meaningful way rather than hurling the most basic of insults would still love to hear what you thought about the film if youre able to discuss curious how a single person can proclaim a movie doesnt have universal appeal when an incredibly high majority of people have agreed that it indeed does seems like logical fallacy if you ask me the ending is absolutely not happy as its a stand in for the long term effect radiation had on the japanese people did you see the part where shes sick or did you legitimately not catch the twist it was subtle and if you had checked out by that point i can understand missing it im a firm believer that critics should obstain from reviewing certain films they clearly dont have an interest in reviewing and you should have stuck to your strengths which you admit this is not one of many of us align ourselves with critics we agree with or share similar interests with and it seems you may have a hard time finding an audience for you opinion besides in these very threads which are not engaged with based on your robust critical film experience but more so the lack of thanks for taking the time to comment its my job to review all types of genres and what a sad belief to have that critics shouldnt review certain films every movie has a chance to win me over including this one but it failed on every level imaginable its just an opinion as is yours  i would be interested in knowing what kind of characters you do connect with as a godzilla fan i recognize im bias in all the movies i have seen all of them up to godzilla 1985 i have always enjoyed seeing godzilla and have never cared about the human characters this movie left me with a changed perspective similar to the first viewing of the matrix the world felt diffrent afterwards not because of the feeling of the veil being pulled back but because my dorky guilty pleasure of film had changed into true art even stranger is i cant get it out of my mind i think this is why so many feel your review  is not authentic without being rude i agree it feels like there may be an agenda at play here or a lack of understanding to the point of reviewing negligence i realize the film worked for so many people and many seem to take it personally when someone else doesnt agree with them as evidenced by a lot of these comments my review is authentic i simply did not like the film for the reasons i stated i even tried to watch it a second time and it still didnt work for me one of the most enjoyable things about film criticism and evaluation of art is that we all dont  have to agree and not every fresh review of the film is glowing nor totally positive its weird to me the defensiveness of the movies fans im just one writer who sees hundreds of movies a year and i simply didnt think it was a good one thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts i appreciate hearing from people who agree and disagree  i thought godzilla minus one was a film with some serious tonal flaws what was that sudden bikini atoll scene was it a godzilla 1998 reference but overall landed very well for me as far as putting me in the shoes of a soldier who felt like a walking ghost that ultimately chooses life by the end a story of hope in the face of overwhelming odds both in the mind and in the physical world the bikini atoll scene was godzilla having an atomic bomb dropped on it you see godzilla getting effected by radiation its an explanation of how it became such a big monster compared to the first attack scene its a reference to the history of the movie and how the test we did at bikini atoll influenced the creation of godzilla in the first place this cannot be a serious review or this is merely an internet blogger not an actual film critic pacing character development acting story and intensity are lacking according to this critic this is the gen z folks who have attention span of a gnat and think bloated budgets and sparkles and explosions and the logo marvel lotr etc make it good  sorry true story telling real personal drama character development and less explosions and a film where you might have to know actual history to have a reference point isnt up to par to modern young people i was born in the 1970s and am a real film critic and i stand behind my review and opinion of this film i do appreciate you taking the time to comment however  im sorry youre had to put up with this harassment i dont agree with you but nobody deserves to be treated with disrespect over an opinion i dont dont think christopher nolan has made a 5 star film that ive seen we all have some film or filmmaker we dont connect with no art can ever be objectively bad only subjectively loved or derided thank you for the kind comment as a critic especially a female im used to the harrassment it unfortunately comes with the territory whether i like or dislike a particular movie art is so subjective and thats okay thanks again for taking the time to comment  you must have had a bad day when you watched this movie  if you have ever seen any of the other blockbuster hollywood versions of godzilla you would know that there is something very different and special about godzilla 1  this film finally focused on the human aspect of the story and removed the constant mindnumbing action sequences of todays throw away movies  i have not seen a movie in over 30 years that i still think about days after watching it and of all things it was a monster movie  it was a monster movie but there was so much more to it than that  regardless i respect your opinion although disagree with your assessment   this was a great film thank you for taking the time to comment im so happy the movie worked for you i know so many people do love it it just wasnt for me  shame on you you are either trying to get clicks or you dont know what you are talking about and have no business being movie critic ive always wondered what goes through the mind of a small time film reviewer whos among an infinitesimal number of rotten tomatoes critics disliking a movie  in minus ones case 2 i really do i hope you know that minus one was created with a budget of 10m to 15m roughly less than 110 of barbie and 120 of a marvel production what is presented onscreen is quite an accomplishment id say your snark over godzillas looks and the surrounding special effects shows that you have no understanding of the monsters heritage and how japanese filmmakers traditionally portray him and the minus ones writerdirector had temerity to center his movie around a human drama set in postwwii japan that wouldve been nearly as compelling without the monster a kamikaze pilot who cant follow through with his mission to die and must live with guiltdriven ptsd and japans innocent citizens forced to rebuild their lives due to politicians poor choices  im sorry the films nuance and subtext passed by you i stand by the 98 percent of the audience who found minus one a genre film achievement as a reviewer who sees an average of close to 300 films a year theres always going to be a handful that simply dont resonate with me minus one is one of those films in 2023 thank you so much for taking the time to read and comment though  im really shocked at the level of vitriol thrown at the reviewer over a piece of entertainment i thought the movie was excellent but i can understand that if the characters dont appeal the film is going to feel slow paced not every movie is for everyone and opinions are not objective fact 98 on rt thought this film was good but thats just an opinion too what is rather remarkable however is the fact that the reviewer has taken every attack in good faith retaining their dignity and compassion in answering some rather deplorable comments im not sure i would have retained my composure so well under the same circumstances people are quite vocal with this review because its a great movie that breaks the formula godzilla 1 is a glorious midfinger to hollywood studios that think people want to see representation and cool visual effects when people just want a good history with good characters and some food for thought  its not an action movie its a drama with aspects of a horror movie maybe you saw the title and thinked oh ok godzilla movie lets see a monster destroying a city with cool effects but this is a historical drama that just have a kaiju its a movie about japan post wwii its about the nuclear bomb its about people losing faith in the government it is about survival guilt and ptsd  who cares if godzilla looks silly ginza attack is about the fear and the grief of losing norinko and the sonder of the scene the black rain after was the same that felt in hiroshima in 1945 silly godzilla with large belly is a metaphor for something very real and truly scary the happy ending is deserved when the engineer says the government dont care about the people they made tanks without armor and planes without catapults  kamikaze but we fight to protect ourselfs the mechanic saw a covard he despised becomes a hero that was ready to die and then he saved his life including a catapult in the plane its amazing writing and characther development the problem with this review was that it didnt differentiate betwen i dont like it and its a good movie if you are a critic and know about cinema you must understand why this movie is so great and then its ok for you to saw but it didnt work for me calling a movie with a small budget bad because its lacking cgi its offensive calling a drama bad for lacking the pace of an action movie is unfair its ok for you to have a personal view on this movie its not ok to say its bad i respect that you didnt like it i loved it i never watch movies in theaters and i went to the theaters to see it 4 times i dislike pretty much everything godzilla too but i saw a youtube video about the history of it that had me interested in this one i think that there were a few cgi scenes girl hanging from train top down from boat that i didnt think were as good but overall the boat chase scene the atomic breath everything else worked really well for me i saw the behind the scenes video they put out and it gave me even greater an appreciation for it i have a friend who is a history buff about tanks and planes he loved the attention to detail on the vehicles he told me they even got the engine sounds on the plane correct as for the story i really liked the human characters i empathized with the main character the only change i would make is i dont think the love interest should have been alive at the end that seemed like a cop out when i compare to the other movies i have seen this one actually stood out as really good i dont like a lot of movies that are high rated on rt or imdb but this one i really enjoyed i hope you stop getting hate not everything is for everyone rhett and link did a song about that once actually that says and i dont mind that i dont like liking the same exact things as you people should learn this bro your review was anything but objective everything you said was subjective and personal i feel like you put more effort in replying to the comments than writting the critique  objectivity is important but all critics bring some subjectivity to their reviews and views its the nature of the beast im so glad you loved godzilla minus one i just didnt think it was entertaining enough to deserve a fresh rating thanks for taking the time to comment i do appreciate it  saw our review on rotten tomatoes how does it feel to be so incredibly wrong about every single thing you wrote you clearly have no clue what you are doing or think you are being super edgy by downgrading the film this should have won film of the year louisa moore is inept and should be relieved of her job 98 on rotten tomatoes and you think youre special because you downgraded the filmmoron i stand behind my review the number of personal attacks about this is truly astounding thanks for sharing your expertise in being utterly unpleasant its truly aweinspiring
Jan 4 2024,positive, if you sift through the cinders there shockingly resilient as they have been through every dark period of the last century are our movies they are cultural markers that can tell us about ourselves if we listen carefully enough they are mirrors if we can stand to look at ourselves cruel and implacable as only the plain and awful truth can be its easy to look back twenty or thirty years and track the character of the time the fears and warnings left like time capsules buried as cultural artifacts in the sand of our diminishing options can we turn that intuition on ourselves i dont know every generation believes theyre the last is what they say though i wonder if what this really means is that every generation comes to realize it deserves to be the last i imagine us scrambling to slow entropy and entropy refusing to slow i remember thinking i could make a difference and how good that used to feel the world is on fire i think you could probably blame fewer than a dozen very wealthy people for that wealthy enough that we no longer have the abilitynor indeed the willto stop them as soon as you allow billionaires to exist the rubicon has been crossed game over so in the time we have left and as the window for our ability to express ourselves about popular genocides in public spaces closes we still have movies these shadows on cave walls telling whatever will be left that we were here and that we knew we did we were so angry and sad and there was nothing we could do because the people and systems that were supposed to protect us only protected them now its done the buzziest movies of 2023 were greta gerwigs dangerously facile barbie and christopher nolans remedial oppenheimer both machinetooled to tweak the pleasure centres of as broad an array of their target demographics as possible and finding themselves the topics of conversations not so much divisive as tediously programmatic i worry that cultural discourse looks like this now skirmishes between evenlymatched featherweights slapfights between emaciated and untrained antagonists that ultimately seem more like staged diversions than prize matches we are not edified arguing about whether the monologue in the one is retrograde and patronizing or if the theme of the other is the nihilistic arrogance of man in the face of the anonymous misery he enacts we are not enriched by weeping at the recognition of unenlightened observations delivered as hambone and cheese masturbation doesnt result in offspring the best movies of 2023 are interesting because theyre more than just reflections of the current state of our state they carry in them the spark ofis it hope hope or hopefulness is there a difference is the difference that one is belief and the other the expression of belief i dont know how to parse it but im holding on to both with two hands so hard my fingernails are leaving tiny bloody crescents on my palms i dont know how much longer i can do it

emerging talent compare her work in silence here with master john woos in the logical endpoint for his career as a choreographer of the sublime dance of heroic bloodshed silent night i feel like ive spent thirty years defending woos narratives as books for operas step charts for elaborate tangos works that operate in experimental and gestural spaces rather than novelistic and narrative ones hes been working towards a silent film for a long time and 2023 seems to be a year where being robbed of ones voice it happens too in sisu and no one will save you speaks piquant and eloquent i think the

and the evergreen urge to belong are captured in this most unlikely of placesa film that is arguably the first truly faithful adaptation of eastman  lairds highconcept underground quartet who were designed to speak to the immigrant experience the fracture of social class in new york and the despair of being invisible in one of the most denselypopulated places in the world its as sharp and savvy in its callouts as spiderman across the spiderverse which shifts its attention from a black kid finding his voice to a young woman seeking to do the same the search for words is central to brandon

sale in infinity pool except actual accomplishment the world is plastic and nothing means anything how could it when the only things it values have a price tag thats the world from which hercule poirot kenneth branagh has retreated he has no friends only admirers he refuses to use his intimidating skills of ratiocination to help the mob of people lined up every day outside his apartment only relenting to entertain a guest when its old friend and crime writer ariadne oliver tina fey shes onto something she tells him a big story and she needs his help it involves a suicide a seance a haunted tenement in a sinking city and a halloween party for orphans where the guests are warned of all the dead children wanting to add to their numbers its spooky sure more so for poirots dangerous despair and eventually the rage that causes him to use his gifts as a bludgeona scythe of obliterating logic that answers every question except the one of his loneliness my favourite line in broadcast news comes when holly hunters typea producer is told it must be nice to believe youre the smartest person in the room and she says no its awful i love all three of branaghs poirot films for this thread of a broken man exploited and celebrated but desperate for a human connection to ground him in the world of the living el conde deals with a different kind of supernatural element in the

doesnt repeat itself but it does rhyme neither film takes sides both take in the absolute irresolvable tragedy of pitting these two groups against each other in ideological battleshe saidshe saids and sprung power dynamics that feel like toothpaste you can never put back in the tube the hardest thing about the last several years has been learning how fragile our systems are and how easily theyre overturned by people who justwant to our governments are the equivalent of those little chains on doors it only works as a deterrent so long as the person trying to break it down refrains from putting the tiniest bit of pressure on it about dry grasses leaves the classroom environment to explore how the foundations built in childhood cast long shadows on a cultures odds for survival while monster is fixated on the price of kindness of standing up for the right things even when the only difference it makes to do so is the assured destruction of the person making the right choice laura mosss birthrebirth is specifically about how even the notion of the right choice is difficult when questions of choice are entangled with existential legislations in the united states that essentially relegate women officially into a caste of secondclass citizen davy chous return to seoul is the immigrantlifethatcouldvebeen film i most connected with in a visceral way this year lost wayward freddie park jimin is a koreanborn woman adopted as a child by loving french parents who as a young twentysomething makes a trip back to korea in search of the parents who gave her up its a setup for any number of familiar scenarios the film assiduously avoids en route to telling a story of cultural friction and misunderstanding resentment and grief and figuring out who you are in maybe the last place you were going to look i love freddie not because she isnt a monumental fuckup whose decisions hurt other people but because she is the film is unsentimental about it people are broken sometimes and they either find solid ground or they drown thats it chou doesnt gild it doesnt provide freddie a safety net merely presents all of these terrible moments where friends like tena guka han decide not to be friends with freddie anymore though not before telling her how sad a person she is arent we all cap this group with mission impossible  dead reckoning part one the continuing adventures of tom

the woman trying to hold it together when massive chunks of her life fly apart bradley cooper attempted to do the exact in the middle of the maelstrom thing with maestro but the difference between the

quiescence the art of making people not care theyre about to end the world and die either in the blast or the fallout is what most of our public discourse is now seeing it represented on film by an abandoned rave way past its endpoint presided over by a topless dj dancing alone in the purple ultraviolet glow is the exact visual metaphor for charlie chaplin rollerskating along the edge of a gaping hole for our modern age of ignoring the uncomfortable top it off with the finest comedy of the year no hard feelings a film about the income gap americas social classes and how jennifer lawrence may be aside from tom cruise the last of our real bona fide movie stars romance in 2023 is defined by aki kaurismäkis deadpan heartbreaker fallen leaves and andrew haighs heartshattering all of us strangersthe one about a congenital loser who realizes he has one last chance to turn everything around and so after fucking up he takes it the other about a writer who creates an entire interior life of hope and acceptance from his despair and alienation kelly reichardts showing up is the first of her uniformly excellent films to truly resonate with me its a portrait of an artist who has an indefinable process and pace and is woefully aggrieved whenever either is violated plagued by inconveniences real and exaggerated she tries to finish a few crucial pieces before her big show but mainly finds cause to be exasperated stressed out and depressed nailed it the interiority of her dysfunction is projected in the surreal expressionism of ari asters beau is afraidanother director making a mark on me for the first time with a personal piece obsessed with the peculiarities and perversions of the life of the mind opening in a republicans vision of new york its anxious nightmarescape pulls beau joaquin phoenix to an innerspace constructed of filial guilt inadequacy and his manifold failures as a man and a father its closest analogue is synecdoche new york and i suspect this is the film asters wanted to make all along before those pesky genre movies got in the way as ive enjoyed hating aster for hating his own films its a shame this one is so good finally theres takashi yamazakis aweinspiring godzilla minus one the years grandest spectacle bar none mixed with japans sober reckoning with the horrors of war and the pieces of that atrocity they collectively own hayao miyazaki has attempted the same sort of reckoning with his last two films the wind rises and the boy and the heron but while im a huge admirer of the former i think the latter is done better here in japans hoariest metaphor for the trauma of wwii and the inherent confusion within of outrage and culpability is godzilla friend or foe is he expression of righteousness or manifestation of justice against not only the japanese but also all of mankind in a year where our viability as a civilized species has come under serious question here is the answer in the resurrection of a golem from the deep civilization was always a lie we told to forgive our unrelieved savagery the sequence where godzilla bites a train and stands with three passenger cars hanging from his jaws like a duck carcass in a hunting dogs mouth gives the lie to the idea any of us ever deserved the benefit of doubt its the insects turn weve had ours and we made a real fucking hash of it five more romances for this block though only two are conventional asteroid city is focused on a widower and an actress but its heartache is built on the tragedy of a playwrights lost muse and they cloned tyrone is supercharged by the screwball interplay between a pimp and his charge even yorgos lanthimoss poor things wherein the untameable bella baxter emma stone learns all about her place in a maledominated society from mastercocksmith duncan wedderburn mark ruffalo before destroying his ego with her independence and polyamorousness takes a few lets say nontraditional routes to get to its happily ever after rude and antisocial its the third of three frankenstein riffs from 2023 after the angry black girl and her monster and birthrebirth that each reclaim mary shelleys envelopepushing activism from within the reanimated body of her work raine allen millers hyphenate debut the charming jump tomorrowesque rye lane thrusts the slightly drippy dom david jonsson together with bon vivant yas vivian oparah both recently single after harrowing breakups they fall in love as they walk and talk through vividly detailed sets in a london exploding with jonathan demme vibrancy and cultural specificity you could spend days in the environments miller creates here or in the company of dom and yas you could spend several more unpacking the sociopolitical complexities buried in the text or you could simply let the joy of it wash over you handinhand with peter sohns no less exquisite elemental pairing a firecracker from the wrong side of the tracks with a sheltered privileged young man who falls for her without considering the problems their mixed relationship might pose the best romance of the year it was marketed as a preachy kid romp about being yourself its also one of 2023s keenest immigrant melodramas dealing as it does with firstgeneration entrepreneurs and the regulatory agencies that make their lives excruciating if not outright impossible its an instant classic as is juel taylors they cloned tyrone in which racial codes are explicated as literal sciencefiction when a nefarious plot to craft an entire urban social system around stereotyped behaviours is discovered by pimp slick charles jamie foxx one of his employees yoyo teyonah parris and a street tough fontaine john boyega who takes care of a neverseen invalid mother while playing muscle for the local crime lord compare its blaxploitation vibe sense of fun and sharp satirical slant against the blithe retrograde racism of gareth edwardss appalling the creator for a sense of how great how welcome it is wes andersons asteroid city is sciencefiction of an entirely different stripe and the first movie of his ive wholly connected with since the darjeeling limited it accessed my grief for my mothers death in the way andersons films used to access my fathers death knowing nothing about andersons life i wonder if this was by accident or providence it doesnt matter asteroid city features one of the best performances of the year from scarlett johansson as an aging starlet recovering from a few bombs and maybe some abuse shes having trouble camouflaging in the desert next to an atomic test site is there nuclear anxiety in the air in 2023 is there ever when apocalypse looms it seems we collectively prick up our ears lets see if its too late you know where my money is the five best films of 2023 begin with alexander paynes the holdovers which i love unreasonably then trenque lauquen laura citarellas indescribable incandescent twopart saga of obsessive love monsters and the end of the world everything 2023 is about in other words packaged in one fourhour odyssey in which two men in love with the same woman search for her across time and the unmarked argentinian backcountry the clues a series of old letters hidden in random library bookslove notes exchanged by two people long dead that gradually morph into documents of a relationship turned sour and possibly worse the beauty of the film though is its refusal to behave its not slow cinema because so much happens in it but neither is it a breakneck thriller with something to solve the mystery of the piece involves the peculiarities of the human heart how we fall in love so helplessly that anything seems possible then fall out of love so calamitously that the sun fails to rise trenque lauquen is unclassifiable if akin to a márquez novel and endlessly compelling its wonderful when evil lurks is savage lawless at the end when our heroes saddle up to fight the rotten i felt like i always feel when chief brody quint and hooper board the orca in jaws thats right wim wenderss perfect days is about the grace of being okay when youre not okayabout living out your days for the little things in defiance of the dismal tide jonathan glazers the zone of interest is that dismal tide 2023 was a marvellous year for the movies and an awful one for the human race theres a presidential election in 2024 and one of the candidates will be an illiterate authoritarian fascist who has already promised to complete the dismantling of every social guardrail in favour of a whitenationalist ethnostate as his first order of business things are about to get worse 2024 will probably be a marvellous year for the movies too god help us all

Jan 4 2024,positive, james greenberg was formerly editor in chief of the dga quarterly the craft journal of the directors guild of america he was film critic for los angeles magazine and has written for the new york times los angeles times new yorker and entertainment weekly he started his career as a critic and reporter for daily variety he is author of roman polanski a retrospective abrams the only book of its kind that polanski has ever participated in chances are that at some point in your youth a godzilla film scared the hell out of you from the first godzilla film in 1954 and in numerous films after that the fire breathing mutant dinosaur has been a symbol of japans postwar despair while exploring themes of masculinity guilt and shame at its best godzilla was a monster with something more on its mind than wreaking havoc and now at a time when the world is falling apart anew godzilla minus one written and directed by japanese effects whiz takashi yamazaki arrives as a thoughtful stylish and entertaining addition to the canon although it serves essentially as a reboot of the original 1954 film and is grounded in the traditions of the series it stands on its own as a meticulously crafted piece of filmmaking in fact one need not care a whit about the history of godzilla to enjoy this roller coaster ride what makes the film so successful is not only the fireworks surrounding the monster but the care paid to the script and construction of characters the emphasis on interpersonal relationships cleverly heightens the tension and impending danger the film toggles back and forth between the mayhem of godzillas attacks and the story of a family and community trying to recover from years of psychic and physical devastation koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki is a young kamikaze pilot in the closing days of the war who doesnt want to die for a lost cause after faking engine trouble and landing his fighter jet on a remote island for repairs he spends the rest of the film battling not only the firebreathing dragon but his own personal demons since everyone knows what godzilla looks like yamazaki is not coy about revealing the width and breathe of his creation starting with a brief flash of light from an atomic bomb test in the atolls the monster emerges as some kind of deepsea prehistoric dinosaur a walking nuclear device in the first few minutes of the film the monster comes out of the water breathing fire and kills most of the population of the island where koichi has landed instead of escaping the war he has brought it with him faced with a chance to gun down godzilla koichi chokes again and does nothing back in an already ravaged tokyo koichi learns that his parents have perished as the city prepares for the arrival of godzilla wideeyed panicstricken people flee the onslaught in wellstaged crowd scenes of chaos and destruction tokyo is no match for a 164foot monster of unbridled rage godzilla picks up subway cars and sends them flying as if they were toy trains which they probably were but the wild action never seems hokey befitting yamazakis standing as one of japans top special effects artists accompanied by the dramatic strings and pulsating rhythms of naoki satôs score spikes pop out of godzillas spine as it shoots blue rays of fire that explode in mushroom clouds after the pandemonium yamazaki adeptly ratchets down the tension and switches gears to a domestic story koichi becomes the de facto guardian of a young woman noriko minami hamabe and an infant girl she has inherited from her dying mother the trio comes together in a makeshift family but despite his affection for noriko and the baby girl koichi is too wracked with humiliation and ptsd to embrace the relationship he has other matters to settle first his war is not yet over how can a society that has been crushed from its wartime experience rouse itself to fight again against godzilla an official government response or help from japans allies is out of the question because of the cold war complexity of americansoviet relations yamazaki clearly doesnt have much faith in official channels if there is a solution it must come from a grassroots effort of citizens banning together to fight for their survival just as kochi must find himself after the war japan as a nation must reclaim its identity to defeat godzilla so a ragtag collection of resourceful army veterans including a reluctant kochi comes together to save the day since no one else will do it for them by default its the useless to the rescue then in a rousing finale on the open sea kochi has to literally fly into the belly of the beast to finally purge his dishonor godzilla minus one manages to function on a number of levels its a cautionary tale and social commentary on nuclear weapons and other natural disasters threatening the future of the world at the same time this iteration of godzilla is a masterful popcorn movie with heart what is perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that the film was made for the miniscule budget by hollywood standards of 15 million as producers like to boast in hollywood every penny is up on the screen and in this case it actually is
Jan 3 2024,positive, on this episode jd and brendan discuss takashi yamazakis epic blockbuster godzilla minus one one of the best surprises of the year coming into the year we didnt know much about the film and there was very little marketing for it but it ended up being one of the very best godzilla movies ever made
Jan 2 2024,positive, for context ive seen a few of the american godzilla movies but ive always felt like i should enjoy godzilla and kaiju giant monster movies in general more than i actually do i have no real connection with these movies and may well have skipped right past godzilla minus one as i wasnt asked to review it by my editor at news 24 were it not for the exceptionally good reviews and enthusiastic wordofmouth and let me tell you the glowing reception to the film could not be more deserved i was blown away by this truly brilliant film i may not be a major fan of the approximately seven million godzilla films that have come out since 1954 but even i know that a large part of what made the original japanese version of the film such a hit was that it was about a giant lizard monster rampaging through japan yes but it was also a metaphor for postwar japan entering the nuclear age godzilla minus one which is set directly after the second world war the title refers to japan being at its lowest  or at zero  after its defeat and complicity in the war with the appearance of godzilla dragging them even lower or to minus one follows that trend by being a thrilling movie about a giant lizard monster yes but also a tale steeped in themes as rich as survivors guilt japans rejection of its bushido deathwarrior code and the effects of war on innocent civilians  postwar japan is fascinating in and of itself and it serves as a timely message for a certain conflict happening right now in the world as a people defeated in war and occupied by their victors rejected violence and worked with those very occupiers to build a thriving nation that is still the envy of most of the world and when filtered through the layers of metaphor and allegory in a film as vibrant heartfelt and yes fun as godzilla minus one it infuses matters of historical interest with a serious emotional charge in short godzilla is a far more substantive film than many perhaps even most of the big serious awards contenders being released now certainly in comparison to ferrari which i saw the day before and my review of it should be up on news 24 any minute now it has infinitely more depth and substance to it but even with that said this is still a giant monster movie and just on that level its a riproaring success that puts the hollywood monsterverse to absolute shame  and for that matter hollywood in general it has human characters that you genuinely care about unlike so many monster movies where theyre mostly just there as cannon fodder a killer score nailbiting action set pieces epic sound design and stunning visuals godzilla himself has also never been better realized than he is here as this genuinely monstrous force of nature nor has the scale and totality of the destruction wrought on everything he comes in contact with been so brutally depicted especially in terms of his famed atomic light ray  that this was all done on a 15 million budget is especially astounding and just makes something like the flash with its 200 million budget and preterminatorlooking special effects all that more of an embarrassment on fiscal waste obviously this lacks big hollywood stars though these really very good actors may be huge in japan but if hollywood wants to end the trend of massive flops that have been plaguing the industry for the past couple of years they should really look here for inspiration regardless i simply cannot recommend godzilla minus one enough and of course this goes without saying it should absolutely be seen at the cinema even if you dont like subtitles or for that matter silly monster movies its brilliant
Dec 31 2023,positive,i never expected to be so emotionally attached to godzilla but this hard hitting character driven story completely captured my full attention from the very beginning to the end i cant stress enough how excellent the character development is

Dec 29 2023,positive, somehow my father knew id be drawn to the horror genre even before it was completely evident to me  or perhaps he instilled my love for classic horror movies he grew up during the golden age of universal monsters he was 7 years old when both dracula and frankenstein debuted in theaters and over the next few years he would have seen the mummy island of lost souls the invisible man the bride of frankenstein and werewolf of london among others he also would have seen rkos king kong so it is no surprise that he encouraged me to watch creature feature when it premiered in 1973 on wtog in the tampa bay market hosted by dr paul bearer  as portrayed by dick bennick sr  the locally produced series presented all of those classic horror films on saturday afternoons its also no surprise he bought me a copy of monsters on the prowl issue 29 in 1975 featuring the cover story a monster at my window with art by jack kirby and its no surprise he chose as my first model kit auroras glowinthedark godzilla when my father was searching for a name for his new sailboat i suggested calico the name of the research vessel in the 1978 hannabarbera animated series godzilla the name stuck godzilla first appeared in the 1954 japanese epic kaiju film directed by ishirō honda two years later the americanized version premiered in us theaters titled godzilla king of the monsters the film featured original footage produced by toho co ltd along with new footage produced by jewell enterprises in addition to cast members from the original the american adaptation adds raymond burr as journalist steve martin the original film spawned a media franchise that has flourished for decades godzilla has been showcased in more than 30 feature films a pop culture icon and internationally recognized intellectual property the character has also appeared in television series novels comic books manga and video games to mark the franchises 70th anniversary toho studios and robot communications released godzilla minus one in japan on nov 3 tohos american subsidiary toho international released the film in north american on dec 1 with english subtitles by way of disclaimer i reiterate i am a lifelong fan of horror and godzilla holds a special place in my heart because the character is intertwined with my childhood memories having said that my recommendation is that you immediately purchase tickets to see godzilla minus one in theaters even if you have never seen a godzilla movie and are unfamiliar with the franchise for those of you who have seen a godzilla film  from the shōwa era toho iterations to the recent american films produced by legendary pictures such as 2019s godzilla king of monsters or 2021s godzilla vs kong  approach this new film with the understanding that it is different than anything you have come to expect from a kaiju movie godzilla minus one is a surprisingly emotional story delving deep into relatable themes focusing on the human spirit and survival in times of uncertainty and tragedy profoundly resonant and candidly expressive in its condemnation of war and epistemic hubris the films succeed at something many films in the franchise fail to do it makes you care about the wellbeing of its central characters written and directed by takashi yamazaki godzilla minus one opens in 1945 in the closing days of world war ii kamikaze kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki separates from his squadron and lands on odo island claiming technical issues in fact he has chosen to disobey orders because he does not want to die the mechanics on the island find nothing wrong with the plane and the lead mechanic sōsaku tachibana munetaka aoki guesses kōichis true motive that night godzilla comes ashore and attacks the island outpost only kōichi and sōsaku survive with the mechanic blaming the pilot for the deaths of his friends in postwar japan kōichi takes refuge in the ruins of tokyo his parents died in the war leaving him alone he reluctantly takes in noriko ōishi minami hamabe a refugee who is caring for an infant whose parents were killed in the bombing of tokyo kōichi gradually accepts responsibility for his found family but he is unable to explore his feelings of affection for them because he is ashamed of what he perceives as his cowardice burdened by survivors guilt and tormented by posttraumatic stress disorder kōichi still manages to find work as a minesweeper allowing him to support noriko and akiko sae nagatani with the country still reeling from defeat in the war godzilla  now mutated by us atomic tests at bikini atoll  reemerges and goes on the offensive after destroying several us naval vessels the monster targets the japanese mainland the united states refuses to commit military support because it fears it would exacerbate existing tensions with the soviet union instead the americans ask the japanese government to deal with the situation even though the imperial japanese navy was decommissioned after the war when the japanese government fails to defend the country a small group of civilians and naval veterans must formulate a plan that involves kōichi and his friends from the minesweeping crew stopping godzilla seems like an impossible task  but living in postwar japan is an equally arduous endeavor for kōichi living is a constant struggle with a range of physical psychological and existential challenges to overcome he is grieving consumed by unwarranted but inescapable guilt and regretful the viewer empathizes with his anguish hoping he will overcome the effects of trauma godzilla minus one is an epic historical drama set in a country devastated by world war ii underscoring the inhumanity of war it balances sentiment and spectacle often making godzilla an incidental aspect of the fight to endure it is an inspirational redemption tale with welldeveloped characters that convey the essential elements of the human condition mortality anxiety aspiration and responsibility oh and godzilla is absolutely terrifying vividly rendered the monster is the epitome of violent catastrophic annihilation godzilla is an allegory for destruction sometimes symbolic of the wrath of nature or the horror of war here the monster works as both a metaphor for unresolved trauma as well as anticipatory anxiety in a world increasingly gripped by chaos despair and tyranny godzilla minus one posits that even in the most desperate times there is reason for hope

Dec 26 2023,positive,the best godzilla film ive ever seen a fantastic film about people and a nation learning to move forward  it just happens to have godzilla as the main villain  and as a villain hes the most vicious godzilla ive ever seen 
Dec 25 2023,positive, godzilla minus one returns to the original postwar iteration of the iconic kaiju not with the special effects that bring the mountainous monster to life but rather with the zeitgeist of those times fueled by the sense of futility over the war just lost and the conviction that the government had betrayed its people as is to be expected godzilla wreaks havoc and cuts a wide swath of destruction through tokyo but the film by takashi yamazaki is centered on people coming to grips with the aftereffects of a lost war using godzilla as a metaphor and manifestation of the angst afflicting a devastated population instead of the noiresque blackandwhite of the original though we are treated to the saturated color of the period films all the better to enjoy the bluelight godzilla emits when revving up for the kill we are in the last days of world war ii when a kamikaze pilot koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki develops mechanical problems with his aircraft landing at the military outpost on odo island for repairs he is confronted by something much worse than the prospect of committing suicide for his country that would be the ancient creature that stalks out of the ocean instead of using is planes artillery to stop it he freezes leading to the death of almost everyone else at the outpost and saddling him with the sort of survivors guilt that will prohibit a return to life as he knew it when japan surrenders not that he is left on the sidelines a chance encounter with a thief minami hamabe struggling to survive in the ruins of tokyo gifts him with an instant family the thief noriko is a plucky young woman orphaned by the war is caring for an infant given to her by the childs dying mother together they band together to cope with a postwar economy in shreds living in the ruins of koichis home where his  parents burned to death and under the angry scrutiny of the only surviving neighbor sakura ando who blames koichi for the deaths of her children because he did not do his job in the war properly godzilla doesnt return again until the atomic tests on the bikini atoll in 1946 when the creature awakens bigger meaner and more weaponized than ever during this time koichi has settled into a platonic domestic routine with noriko and baby akika and hes finally found a job that can allow them to rebuild their lives this being a gloss on the lingering aftereffects of war its a job clearing the tens of thousands of mines left behind by both sides in the ocean surrounding japan its dangerous work but not fatal his crewmates are an exsailor kuranosuke sasaki with a profound contempt for government orders a former naval engineer hidetaka yoshioka with a frothy hairstyle and a lighthearted spirit that hides his true feelings and a young man munetaka aoki who despairs that he was not able to fight for his country when godzilla makes a beeline for tokyo the government once again falls short of protecting its citizens and the tiny boat tasked with safely detonating mines finds itself in the center of the battle to save japan this too is a metaphor as yamazaki spins a tale of selflessness and cooperation while also delivering a damning manifesto against violence in the way godzilla reacts to the weapons used against him they just makes him more powerful special kudos to the way the spikes on his back glow and then ahem stiffen as he prepares to unleash his oral heat ray of destruction and how the effects folk acknowledge that a creature that large will move with deliberation but not alacrity on land the action sequences are expertly directed to keep you one the edge of your seat and the solution to the godzilla problem is not just in keeping with the films antiviolence stance but is also a nifty bit of science real nifty sure the big guy is impressive to watch tossing battleships like javelins and of course ravaging tokyo but the real action is people recovering from the traumas collective and individual of the war kamiki is just as impressive as any of the special effects with a performance of depth tenderness and pathos he is also a man of exceptional beauty which adds to the metaphors at work pitting the beauty of life against sacrifices both meaningless and heroic and it makes his defensive cruelty to those closest to him all the more poignant godzilla minus one is one of the more effective antiwar films even before the kid complains that hes never seen battle and is told that its something of which he should be proud yamazaki makes his case that fighting to the death is nothing compared to fighting for the future wise words and a film as weighty and entertaining as godzilla himself
Dec 24 2023,positive, its the most wonderful time of the year thats right movie awards season and ive been busy watching some of the most enticing films that remain on the 2023 docket and submitting my ballots for the few critics groups that will have me as a member those obligations have left me precious little time to actually write the damn things up but i wanted to offer a few brief thoughts on some of the best offerings currently in theaters  all of which happen to be foreign language films with its weird and wonderful tale of a boy grieving the loss of his mother via an adventure in a parallel universe the boy and the heron thrives thanks to the topshelf imagination that only writerdirector hayao miyazaki can deliver masaki sudas quirky expressive voice work as the grey heron should be up for awards and the work itself will hopefully win the oscar for best animated feature for the stunning visuals and themes of passing the torch which feel especially poignant considering where the filmmaker is in his career its a fitting farewell for miyazaki  but then we said the same thing about the wind rises a decade ago writerdirector takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one is a good godzilla movie which means its a good action movie but awarding it additional laurels would be generous the focus on failed kamikaze pilot shikishima ryunosuke kamiki who seeks to restore his honor and forms an unconventional family with some fellow survivors offers decent human drama and something to care about as the big lizard keeps disrupting shikishimas rebuilding process but those interruptions are the main draw and they mostly deliver in the thrills department  certainly more than hollywoods subpar monsterverse efforts over the past decade with such a solid foundation in place godzilla minus one sticks its landing with a satisfying emotional climax but yamazaki doesnt know when to fade to black and tacks on a manipulative and frankly implausible  even in a godzilla movie  second ending that negates much of the wouldbe endings richness yûji sakamotos script presents a rashomonlike scenario but one that stretches into numerous situations to show how incorrect conclusions can be reached despite the best intentions the results are cumulatively devastating  and bringing tissues with you to the theater is highly recommended six years after one of the few times hes come up short  the soso the other side of hope  the finnish writerdirector returns to form with fallen leaves an 81minute including credits marvel in which lonely helsinki loners ansa alma pöysti and holappa jussi vatanen attempt to share hearts despite and because of their quirks imbued with kaurismäkis copywritten deadpan charms these lovable lovers traverse the frustrations of manual labor jobs and find relief through lifes simple pleasures  much like we poor souls seek solace in the filmmakers beautiful sliceoflife dramas
Dec 24 2023,positive, just in time for the 70th anniversary of the character director takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one has become an international hit and the most successful live action japanese film in history at the american box office but does this latest addition to the kaiju genre live up to the hype it takes place just after world war 2 with japan reeling from its loss to the allied forces kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki stars as a former kamikaze pilot living with survivors guilt after avoiding death and surviving the first attack from godzilla  if you are confused as to whether this has any connection to apples monarch legacy of monsters show or next years godzilla x kong sequel it doesnt the character godzilla exists in two franchises the original japanese movies made by studio toho and the american englishlanguage adaptations made by legendary studios referred to as the monsterverse while the hollywood versions are financially successful few enthusiasts would put those films over the japanese incarnations godzilla works best in japan because ever since the original it has been linked to japanese identity the first film in 1954 represented postwar nuclear panic felt keenly by the nation that suffered the nagasaki and hiroshima bombings seventy years later yamazaki delivers something more contemplative with shikishimas journey one of shame and regret at having chosen living defeat over a glorious death  thats not to say that the set pieces are an afterthought with around a tenth of the budget of the hollywood films yamazaki creates kaiju attacks that feel devastating its as much about the people fleeing in terror from each booming step as it is the ferocity of godzilla itself and while the action scenes are more sporadic than you might expect every faceoff means something  ryunosuke kamiki a former child actor who was discovered by studio ghibli legend hayao miyazaki is gripping in the lead role his trauma as well as the unspoken longing for partner noriko minami hamabe add layers to the story that keep the twohour running time breeze by much of the supporting cast have little to do other than plan attacks although yuki yamada stands out as a young crewman looking to prove himself 
Dec 23 2023,positive, hollywood continues to trash the kaijueiga genre with such wildly expensive but soso monster flicks as godzilla x kong toho studios which codified the form in 1953 with ishiro hondas godzilla then arguably ruined it with 28 monster sequels and odd licensing arrangements has of late been determined to do justice to its biggest star this is not merely a rubber monster suit or its cgi equivalent godzilla minus one not only matches the potent regeneration of the worldwide 2016 hit shin godzilla its innovative meaningful engagement with the big scaly monster of the title is jollied along by historical depth and exciting set pieces the enduring quality of the 1953 original is rooted in its engagement with the twin atomic disasters of nagasaki and hiroshima this prequel similarly yokes american imperialism postwar malaise survivor guilt and weaponised atomic power to produce the best action film of the year godzilla opens on a remote south pacific island where a young kamikaze pilot shikishima ryunosuke kamiki sensing defeat pretends his engine is malfunctioning he is already racked with guilt and the sudden and murderous appearance of the titular lizard leaves him with an emotional weight he ferries back to a ruined tokyo where he forms a makeshift if emotionally distant family with an orphaned young woman minami hamabe and a baby she found in the rubble its a poignant vignette that is soon enlivened by entertaining counterfactuals godzilla now powered by the bikini atoll tests rises from the deep to do untold damage to recovering tokyo in 1953 shikishima now a scavenger with a band of scientists and seafarers must reckon with the scaly beast as with hondas original cgi is eclipsed by clever cinema grammar a flick of the tail here bang goes the neighbourhood there takashi yamazakis urgent script  written against a backdrop of covidrelated governmental distrust  adds gravitas to the thrills and spills
Dec 22 2023,positive, heres the thing im not a film guy i dont really know directors i definitely dont know composers and if the actor wasnt in die hard i probably have no idea who youre talking about genres canons and references elude me i am not proud of this ignoranceim actually a little insecure about it if you cant tellbut i note it because its important for you to understand that every time i watch a movie its like a baby trying a food for the first time with no knowledge or appreciation for the preparation of the food the history of the culture behind it the ratio of salt to sweet but baby knows what baby likes and this baby likes godzillaand thinks godzilla minus one is the best movie of the year do you like crying and laughing and being scared do you enjoy a movie that is actually movie length two hours and four minutes to be precise starring people who are conventionally attractive but reasonable who have pores and scars instead of a disturbing number of abs even godzilla himself looks real 3d pleasurably animatronic especially when hunting fishing boats with a snarl hes not a blownout glassy computergenerated special effect but substantive godzilla is the draw but equally at the wild and monstrous heart of this movie is a surprisingly optimistic exploration of ptsd shame survivors guilt and how we are all more than the worst things weve ever done curiously for an action movie the lesson of godzilla minus one isnt that we need a hero to save us individuals dont have to sacrifice themselves to save the world rather through collective action we save each other that message alone i think is worth seeing on the big screen and of course theres also the kickass atomic breath pg13 124 min 
Dec 22 2023,positive, ive spent the past two days making graphics and getting things ready for todays gwnyfca nomination announcement everything will start tweeting out around 1000am est like usual and then go live on the website the change this year is that the winners will be announced inperson for the first time at the dryden theatre in rochester on 1624 should be a cool change of pace the deadline for top tens at the film stage was extended until after christmas so im hoping to watch a couple more foreign films ive missed this weekend just in case they want to sneak in i do need to also start and finish my top ten movie posters of 2023 though so i dont know what ill be able to get done the plan is at least two of these newly shortlisted oscar picks perfect days the taste of things the promised land godland society of the snow and totem and speaking of that shortlist what a travesty that kokomo city didnt make the cut i truly thought it was a guarantee thankfully four daughters did make it thats my 1 doc of the year so far and it just hit vod today so now is your chance to watch it too if watching andrew haighs all of us strangers isnt enough to leave you speechless try reading the synopsis of the novel by taichi yamada that he adapted my first reaction was to laugh because its such a stark departure in tone and genre but then i started to think about it more i started to see the correlations between what the couple is doing to yamadas protagonist and what theyre doing to haighs counterpart both take something the differencebeyond morphing the physical into the emotionalis that haighs are also giving something back adam andrew scott needs it too not just because his screenwriter is mired in a bout of writers block while dealing with the nuisances of living in an almost empty brand new apartment complex in london but because hes never been able to shake the loneliness that has consumed him since his parents jamie bell and claire foy died thirty years ago in a car crash we can see the sadness in his eyes and then theres the fear and embarrassment that replace it when harry paul mescal knocks on his door adam knows isolation hes comfortable with its pain to dare to love and risk losing it again theres nothing scarier these heavy emotions mix with nostalgia to put him on a train back to his childhood home the point is to confront the memories to reconcile who he was with who he is and find a pathway forward what he discovers instead is an opportunity to drift backwardsto loosen his grip on closure by distracting himself from the resurfacing grief via an impossible fantasy that will only leave him hurting more because who should greet him at the door but his mum and dad neither having aged a day since their fateful crash they know theyre dead and they know adam is their son they cant wait to find out about the man hes become the film hinges entirely on scotts performance as a result not just with his parents and the potential that arrives from telling them everything he couldnt growing up including that hes gay but also with the blossoming romance opposite harry what begins with awkward shyness gradually opens with a newfound confidence and desire for exploration its as though adam has shed decades of baggage from his shoulders through the regular visits he shares with his parents theres increased clarity excitement and energy that he pours into his work and relationship hes somehow become whole but at what cost if this was yamadas original adam would be paying with his soul haigh takes a different route he admittedly moves more towards the metaphysical rather than the supernatural because the longer adam stays with his parents the harder it becomes to reclaim the life he has built their presence becomes a crutch now as much as their absence did then it pushes him outside of his comfort zone in both good ways and bad since the closure he needs has less to do with having them around then it does with having the chance to willingly let them go its a devastating revelation made more so by three absolutely devastating performances from scott bell and foy and just as he must accept the truth of what has happened to them so too must he accept his own truth and the choices hes made between his parents and harry hes finally escaped a selfinflected exile of body and mindan evolution that comes with its own fresh dangers the hope then is that these experiences have better prepared him for new tragedies that hindsight and recognition have allowed him to understand he doesnt have to feel guilty for surviving yes its sad yes hes sorry he couldnt save them but it doesnt mean hes not worthy of living just because they werent given the chance it all leads to a heartbreaking finale thats less a shock because you werent expecting it than it is for knowing and dreading that it was always coming haigh beautifully handles the narrative progressions to ensure he doesnt have to jump through hoops distracting us from a truth hidden in plain sight he knows how to use his script to prevent us from asking questions but it never feels manipulative we are simply too caught up in the endorphin release to consider what else is going on until adam himself is ready it doesnt make it any less crushing but it does provide hope hope that adam can embrace that which he had and not simply lament that which hes lost i really liked the final 2530 minutes of the new cinematic musical iteration of the color purple i think it handles the themes of forgiveness and generational trauma much better than steven spielbergs adaptation and drives home the emotional weight of what celies happilyeverafter truly means in context with the horrors she endured the four decades prior the firsttwo hours though a freight train of a cliffs notes cram session that seems to slap you in the face to look somewhere else whenever a dramatic moment implores you to take a pause marcus gardleys script simply doesnt have time for introspection maybe i shouldnt have watched the 1984 version the day before because having its pace and care in my memory made the speed at which this one travels untenable i wasnt therefore surprised to read this isnt actually a strict translation of the stage musical so much so that it credits that tony awardwinning production after alice walkers original novel as another source of inspiration rather than a part of the screenplay itself removing thirteen songs and reworking the narrative will do that i only wonder then how much better marsha normans broadway book is and whether it gives the subject matter the room it needs to breathe even so fantasia barrino and danielle brooks are great reprising their roles the pacing might refuse to give them their moment to shine and emote before cutting to the next scene but their impact is definitely felt nonetheless colman domingo and corey hawkins are really good too with taraji p henson doing her best to elevate a crucial role thats sadly been reduced to little more than muse and ride out of dodge so while director blitz bazawule gives the production a welcome kinetic style it comes at the detriment of the whole the finished result remains solid enough to be a worthwhile experience but id probably spend the money to see a touring production of the original musical at my local theater before watching it again the movie ferrari is a good metaphor for the vehicles enzo ferrari adam driver created beautiful sleek powerful but most importantly a soulless machine from the very start of michael manns film we learn that life is complex that despite all our best efforts ambitions fears and hopes we are beholden to the world around us all it takes is one unfortunate misstep to ruin everything and the only way to survive that existential crisis of mortality is to steel oneself from ever letting the emotional fallout of such inevitable tragedies change your course that seems to be the lesson in troy kennedy martins script adapted from brock yates biography yes men like enzo can mourn their friends in private in their minds but to show weakness in public is a death sentence so they delude themselves into believing they have some grand purpose beyond simply enjoying life and loving their families they talk about legacy and pride and how fear is a liability rather than a strength fear will get you killed but hubris will make you a martyr a hero and yet that lack of fear is what gets enzo into so much trouble he doesnt worry about hurting his wife and business partner laura penélope cruz is very good when starting an affair with lina lardi shailene woodley during the war his conscience didnt stop him his humanity didnt make him question his actions he deserved to be happy at the expense of those who loved him he deserved to do whatever he wanted while making sure they couldnt their actions had to take his success into consideration and his didnt need to worry about their sorrow its the same with his drivers his employees the press everyone is a pawn even his own bastard son who wants nothing more than to take his name for his confirmation how will that affect the ferrari brand how will it affect lauras state of mind and thus the ferrari brand how will needing to think about it distract enzo from the impending mille miglia race and thus the need to inject capital into the company and thus the ferrari brand thats what matters thats what motivates his every move those brief moments of honesty and compassion tussling young pieros giuseppe festinese hair exceptions proving the rule does ferrari use this truth thats baked into its very dna to judge or comment on it though no and that to me is a mistake by not showing the actions of this callous onetrackminded legend of racing sports cars and italy itself with purpose it condones them it says men in his position are allowed to act that way because they employ thousands of people and thus carry the burden of forsaking their humanity to make money who thinks thats a worthwhile message for todays world a man on the brink of bankruptcy leveraging those in his control to stay solvent by letting them die to achieve that goal sorry but no i felt nothing for him nothing for his company and by extension nothing for the central race the stakes are shifted off the racers off victory off everything but whether ferrari will prove marketable enough to stay afloat so gabriel leone patrick dempsey and jack oconnell are mere afterthoughts more pawns to a story that attempts to draw a through line between unavoidable tragedy and negligent tragedy as though someone like enzo ferrari could ever comprehend the depth of emotion found via the comparison beyond empty words dino dies long live the new son a racer dies resumés from replacements abound bystanders die simply wanting to admire enzos creations how much money will it take to forgive forget and let him risk doing it again the answer is zero we love our entertainment and vicarious fantasies way too much to hold anyone in power accountable wed rather give them glacially paced oscarbait biopics that pretend cold callousness is a trait of greatness rather than evil its more a movie with godzilla than a godzilla movie as the monster himself is an afterthought not because japan has seen him before but because the war has them feeling so defeated that their first reaction upon seeing him is here we go again and thats where godzilla minus one stands out its not a unique movie and the pacing is very slow with little plot propulsion beyond we need to stop godzilla without anyones help because tensions remain high between the us and ussr but thank goodness the handful of characters we introduced to you are just the right people to do so but the central nihilism is refreshing because its not about revenge or the bomb or outside interference at all its about all the ways japan let the japanese down itself government secrets sending men to die as kamikazes leaving the poor helpless takashi yamazaki is pulling no punches where patriotism is concerned shifting the focus from sacrificing yourself for country to sacrificing yourself for future generations who shouldnt have to become cannon fodder like they did i dont necessarily think the humaninterest stuff works perfectlytime passes so quickly that conflict overshadows emotion every single timebut it has for others as for the monster itself this godzilla is pretty cool with its chargedup heat ray and it does look great for having a sub15milliondollar budget but dont tell me it looks like a 300milliondollar budget because it certainly does not this was shot very particularly to stretch that cash and often reminded me of sky captain and the world of tomorrow aesthetically the real lesson isnt about making a little money look good though the lesson is that you dont need a lot of money to be good its just too much for a twohour movie writerdirector sean durkin had to literally erase one of the von erich brothers from history because adding another tragic demise especially one so close to that of a different brother would be too redundant to the pacing of the film the dominoes fall so quickly that its also easy to forget these are grown men with wives and families and not just young boys going to war in the ring for dad because giving any of them threedimensions besides kevin zac efron would add five more hours with all that being said however the iron claw proves about as effective as it could due to durkins juggling act between history and narrative propulsion the idea is to center kevin for obvious reasons hes the supposed heir to the iron claw throne built by his toxically domineering father fritz holt mccallany whos the size of a house with an even bigger heart as doris maura tierney eldest surviving son kevin becomes a sort of secondary father figure to his brothers the compassionate ear to oppose their fathers doubling as employer demands we understand this dynamic pretty early on thanks to youngest because chris is removed brother mike stanley simons he plays the guitar and skips workout sessions he enjoys watching kevin and david harris dickinson wrestle but wants nothing to do with it himselfa fact his older brother sees and appreciates despite dads refusal but kevin doesnt really have a say no one does besides fritz and even he pretends he doesnt if the words he should say dont help reach his goal of nwa supremacy ask either parent to open their eyes and see whats really happening and they shrug while saying you boys work it out yourselves its a mantra kevin takes to heart one that forces him to feel guilt when bodies start falling and its not because he finds love lily james pam to ground him i mean it is since the others dont get their reallife relationships onscreen its because he sees the truth while also embracing his role so when david replaces him at the top of the pecking order kevin gets mad at the situation rather than the man when kerry jeremy allen white does the same rinse and repeat where those more polished public speakers crave the limelight kevin simply wants familial success he feels responsible for it  as well as the defeats efron is very good in the role even if his character is caught in a cycle that demands he grieve rage and reset over and over again if not for mccallany and tierneys dedication to blindly absolving themselves of their own complicity the drama would become even more repetitive than it already does thanks to the truncated length in which it tries to give depth to such a sprawling series of unfortunate events sparked by drugs ambition and the warped desire to make daddy proud because even though we feel each death through kevins pain we never get to truly sit with it before the next one falls so think of this as a good distillation of a much larger tale durkin whets our appetite for the example of legacys insidious hold on a familys pursuit of greatness at the cost of their happiness that exists if someone could do it justice in a miniseries that allows each brother his own episode to detail the specific ways in which the pressure became too much to bear as it is now the iron claw is an abridged depiction of a curse as selffulfilling prophecy rather than a dissection of that curses origins its enough to move audiences showcase efron and ignite google searches to discover the everything left out everyone tells sylvia jessica chastain that what she remembers from her childhood never happened everyone tells saul peter sarsgaard that what hes forgotten did she tries her best to stay locked in her apartment with teenage daughter anna brooke timber so as to avoid the cruel world he tries to escape his locked home with brother isaac josh charles to experience it so of course they find themselves on a collision course in michel francos latest film memory that they do so at a high school reunion is even more onthenose considering the whole evening is about nostalgia and remembrance like sylvias sister olivia merritt wever saul attends to let those moments flood back while sylvia does her best to remain unnoticed and thus not risk being triggered by faces that will surely take her back to one of the most harrowing periods of her life so when saul sits down next to her without saying a word she cant help grabbing her coat to leave the film is structured in an interesting way that forces us to question that which we know about these two characters we should believe that saul did what sylvia accuses him of doing regardless of whether he remembers it and yet the film quickly presents evidence to the contrary it intrigues insofar as allowing this relationship to blossom where its romance is concerned but problematic when you begin to ask yourself why franco would sow that seed of doubt at all i found myself watching the rest with dread to me the only reason to write the script in this way is to eventually reveal that the evidence was wrong and what sylvia first believed was true yet thats not what franco does another shoe will inevitably drop courtesy of learning the facts behind why sylvia is estranged from her mother jessica harpers samantha but it has nothing to do with saul the deflection allows the impact of that revelation to hit home but it also muddies the narrative waters as far as what it is were watching the final result still captivates though its value is less about plot than the characters and how their respective brokenness has positioned them to be exactly who the other needs to break free from the psychological andor physical prisons in which they find themselves as such the real draw is performance both chastain and sarsgaard earn their emotional ache and our attention during happy sad and nightmarish times theyre doing their best to survive the outside entities that attempt to control them desperate to live in their truth regardless of the societal or familial consequences i do love the comedy that comes from a literalist character caught within a world of emotionally insecure babies that bella baxter emma stone is quite literally a baby inside a grown womans body who becomes a literalist as a direct result of her curiosity makes it all the more entertaining a juxtaposition because she doesnt deal in dualities or decorum shes a child with wants and needs and an utter lack of patience with which to wait for those things to be fulfilled its why shes able to evolve into a robotic genius of mankinds practical potential while reducing everyone else to the insufficient creatures their unearned superiority cannot hide i also love many yorgos lanthimos films dogtooth the lobster the favourite just superb unfortunately sprinkled in with that trio are the equally wild swinging failuresat least to my mind since many others love them too poor things straddles the line separating those two halves a bit too closely for my liking vacillating between insufferable and hilarious throughout its almost twoandahalfhour runtime and it honestly comes down to a coin toss as to whether the next scene will be one or the other since the tone is exactingly consistent i just think some locales and characters became too much of a bore that too isnt necessarily a symptom as much as a feature since they become bores to bella herself tony mcnamaras adaptation of alasdair grays novel sends us on an adventure through her rapid education and thus provides us a front row seat to what pleasures intrigues and disgusts her along the way ever the optimist despite her discerning outlook bella ultimately stays with that which disgusts her a little too long sometimes it allows their inadequacy to shift from tedium to comedy but other times it just reinforces how far past their purpose theyve become randomly going back to london to remind us that dr godwin baxter willem dafoe and max mccandles ramy youssef must remain relevant for the future despite them being forgotten afterthoughts in the present doesnt help matters if anything it frustrated me to no end because they were never truly interesting characters beyond their proximity to bella in the first place so without her they become distractions and inevitably postpone the payoff of her evolution as an independent freethinking woman at a time when men saw both as reason to murder since they saw women as little more than possessions its why mark ruffalos duncan wedderburn is fun as an instructor of carnality and funnier as a victim to his own tricks albeit intentional tricks when he victimizes women and unintentional causality when bellas actions have him victimizing himself once he hits that point however its time to move on although the film seems to understand this by switching venues it keeps him well past his prime hell still rise to the occasion for a laugh here and there but not enough to keep his presence warranted as other more fascinating creatures arrive hanna schygulla jerrod carmichael and the always brilliant kathryn hunter between those moments that do work including a welcome full circle finale alongside christopher abbott stones transfixing performance of a human being maturing from toddler to rhodes scholar in a matter of months and the absolutely gorgeous production design though any unavoidable fatigue i did feel was worth it i dont think the final result is as smart as it thinks it is or that what its saying is profound let alone unique but poor things is an entertaining ride that proveslike bella vs felicity margaret qualleyhow not all experiments work perfectly but we shouldnt discount the attempt in case the next one does keoghan carries this diversionary tale of eat the rich politics right through a silly curtain lift that makes it seem fennell thinks were as vapidly dumb as the cattons covering their eyes when the ring is on tv  full thoughts at hhys only with this experience and knowledge as well as the tools to make it work for them can women eya and tayssirs age attempt to finally break the cycle of exploitation and persecution into which they were born

Dec 21 2023,positive, this time of year is an intense time for me as a critic and podcaster between my holiday coverage at hallmarkies podcast and getting all the awards contenders watched i am woefully behind on my reviews therefore over the next few days you are going to be seeing a lot of shorter reviews as i try and get my opinions out into the world in this post we are looking at 2 recent blockbusters one that feels like the last tired push from a corporate behemoth and one that continues on a decadeslong tradition of moviemaking with heart and soul lets talk about aquaman vs godzilla for a long time i was one that defended comicbook movies against folks who said they arent cinema but it has become increasingly more difficult to do so in 2023 what should be explorations into popular mythmaking and escapism have turned into soulless corporate exercises of mundanity and moneycalculated blandness such is the case in our last entry for the year aquaman and the lost kingdom in this final entry in the dceu director james wan has given us a laborious reverential selfserious slog if you want to see an actual good blockbuster with compelling characters and action look towards japan and godzilla minus one i have not seen all of them but i do think it is the best godzilla movie ive ever seen ryunosuke kamiki plays koichi who is disgraced when he fails to be a kamikaze pilot in wwii and he cannot shoot the godzilla monster that attacks his crew this gives the entire story an emotional weight beyond the typical monster movie trappings of the franchise minami hamabe steals any scene she is in as noriko oishi koichis partner like all the good godzilla movies godzilla minus one has something to say about war nuclear arms the environment and toxic masculinity what does it mean to be a hero this is something that plagues koichi almost as much as the giant monster throughout the film i also appreciate that all of the monster action is clear and i can see what is happening unlike the recent godzilla king of the monsters made here in america the music is also excellent i never thought a godzilla movie would be one of my favorite films of the year but thats where we are so there you have 2 wouldbe epics at theaters right now i know which one id recommend and see again if given the chance happy moviegoing 
Dec 21 2023,positive, how many of the human characters can you remember from the various godzilla movies godzilla minus one gives us a stirring central figure koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot in the waning days of world war ii who abandons his suicidal mission instead landing on remote island and claiming to the mechanics there that his plane malfunctioned just as they realize hes lying godzilla attacks shikishima escapes but most of the others dont giving him a double dose of survivors guilt when he returns to the devastated japanese mainland when godzilla resurfaces the monster embodies shikishimas deepest fears writerdirector takashi yamazaki and his team of effects artists bring a thrilling immediacy and tactility to the monster sequences but what i loved most about godzilla minus one is the way it evokes the sense of loss and mourning of the granddaddy of these pictures 1954s gojira godzilla in the us is your war finally over shikishima is asked near the end of the film as long as our wars arent well need godzilla movies like this
Dec 21 2023,positive,it gets the balance between drama and spectacle and proper content it has substance 
Dec 20 2023,positive, with the franchises 70th anniversary imminent japanese studio toho goes back to the beginning with their latest godzilla film or rather before the beginning sort of you can view godzilla minus one as an alternate genesis for the iconic monster as interpreting it as a definite prequel to the original  something barely alluded to in the text  can negate this new films tension that said the strength of the craft ensures its still an enthralling visual and dramatic ride regardless of any nagging thoughts about how the film can possibly have a satisfying conclusion in its own rightthe very first godzilla film was set around the same time as its 1954 release with the sea creature symbolising japans overriding fears concerning the aftermath of the war and nuclear attacks godzilla minus one takes these same ideas but places them in an even bleaker context starting in world war iis final days and taking place across the following two years as japan rebuilds from the ruins this thrilling film charts the green giants journey from being slightly bigger than a trex  terrorising people on a beach  to cityconquering behemoth thanks to evolutionary enhancement via 1946s operation crossroadswriting directing and leading the films visual effects team takashi yamazaki delivers impressive legitimately scary set pieces and crucially the time spent with the genuinely appealing human ensemble in between attacks is truly compelling exploring postwar trauma communityled resistance to government disinformation and trying to salvage peaceful prospects within the most disastrous circumstances
Dec 19 2023,positive, godzilla minus one is a monster movie of singular power using horrorinfused kaiju spectacle to deliver an emotionally compelling story of grief wartime trauma and hope most importantly its genreleading visual effects scenes are complemented by richly soulful performances and humane themes of reconciliation and redemption godzilla has experienced a major resurgence in the past decade the crowdpleasing pugilism of the american monsterverse franchise continues to expand under the leadership of legendary pictures while godzillas japanese owneroriginators toho have steadily released an array of more cerebral mostly animated projects that explore godzillas weirder more eldritch dimension godzilla minus one straddles the sensibilities of both delivering worldclass scenes of monster rampage a story of considerable depth and pathos and one of the strangest most terrifying incarnations of godzilla in the franchises seventyyear history the filmhas a straightforward premise in a japan ravaged by world war two godzillas attacks take the country from zero to minus one in many respects the film too is direct and uncomplicated as it hits every major story beat that any audience would expect from a godzilla story urban destruction fleeing crowds the monsters horrifying emergence from the ocean all executed with percussive bombast and luminous visual flair it features several extraordinarily satisfying action scenes which deliver thrilling moments of monster mayhem and display to jawdropping effect the mastery of visual effects for which the film is already beginning to reap major awards but the film also has plenty of surprises up its sleeve several characters are forthright in their criticism of japans government and the 194552 us occupation in ways that resonate with contemporary matters undergirding the film with an intriguing if coded political critique the score is operatic grandiose and spinetingling perhaps most welcome however is the emotional sophistication of the movie as it tackles substantial themes of historical responsibility grief and redemption all channelled through the survivors guilt of protagonist kōichi shikishima kamiki ryunosuke a kamikaze pilot haunted by his inability to die his statemandated wartime death everybody knows that godzilla was originally a symbol or metaphor for the atomic bomb over the years godzillas meaning has grown and shifted appearing sometimes as tragic often heroic sometimes cute and childfriendly godzilla minus one brings out unexpected aspects of the creatures original wartime resonance focusing in depth on the abject struggles of ordinary japanese people scratching a living in the ruins of a firebombed tokyo their confrontation with godzilla is rendered in ways that foreground their resilience comradeship compassion and hope imbuing what could have been a maudlin and grimdark affair with the warmth and humanity for which the screenwriting of takashi yamazaki who directs writes and handles the films exquisite vfx is rightly celebrated and godzilla itself has never looked better characterised as a radioactive island god saturated with vicious bloodthirsty hate and rendered in extraordinarily lucid and gnarly detail it delivers serious thrills and some unforgettable images godzilla minus one is a superlative monster movie see it
Dec 19 2023,positive,i dont think its a great film or anything its fine its got some good moments but i didnt go crazy for it
Dec 19 2023,positive,this is the film that godzilla fans have been waiting for
Dec 19 2023,positive, in a rum week for american cinema  one in which the french have revamped the superhero template with the three musketeers milady  the japanese have effectively humiliated hollywood by delivering the best megamonster movie since peter jacksons king kong in 2005 and at a fraction of the going price 
Dec 18 2023,positive, it can be easy for audiences adoringly saturating themselves in legendarys monsterverse to forget all about toho studios ongoing age of godzilla movies which is a shame because the latest offering takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one is something to savour the 33rd godzilla film and the 5th of the franchises reiwa era is beyond doubt the best godzilla movie since ishirō hondas seminal first almost 70 years ago with minus one explicitly celebrating godzillas anniversary it is a fitting a tribute to one of the biggest movie icons in the world  at the end of world war two kamikaze pilot kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki returns back to his family home in tokyo only to find that it has been destroyed and his parents have been killed given that he is a kamikaze pilot however returning home was never part of the mission plan and he is chastised by those around him for not following through on his wartime duty along with his found family of noriko ōishi minami hamabe and the rescued child akiko sae nagatani shikishima tries to rebuild his life while grappling with survivors guilt this is interrupted by godzilla who shikishima had also confronted two years earlier in the creatures infancy godzilla decides to devastate tokyo just as the city has put the ravages of war behind it shikishima then joins a crew of private citizens who plan to destroy godzilla once and for all minus one is a godzilla movie first and foremost but it is also an emotionally charged look at the morals of war failure and the value of individual life while hondas godzilla has been read as a statement about japanese collective trauma minus one channels its ethical exploration mostly through one character  shikishima who feels responsible for the death of others as well as thinking that he does not deserve to live  godzilla is more than a harbinger of death he is the very symbol of shikishimas perceived failure and shortcomings you genuinely believe that he has it out for this big lizard without it feeling needlessly silly or unmerited this personal struggle lends itself to an incredibly tense finale where shikishimas ultimate intentions are unclear while also proving that sticking a massive radioactive monster in your film is no excuse to litter it with shallow human characters kamikis performance as the former pilot deserves a lot of praise he wears the pain guilt and devastation at all times to help you become intimately enveloped in his struggle  a drama about a kamikaze pilots survivors guilt would likely make for a solid drama in and of itself but as already mentioned this is a godzilla movie through and through and the big man has rarely looked so good with different eras of the character seemingly combining into one monstrous wonder yamazaki lingers on godzillas devastation and powers as an unstoppable force of nature evoking wartime and apocalyptic imagery to make this one of the truly terrifying incarnations of the creature  such is the detail put into his design and the atmosphere of dread he creates just by existing he feels frighteningly real a lot has been said online about the quality of the visual effects given the remarkably low budget even if japanese labour laws explain a large part of this yamazaki who is also in charge of the films vfx makes the most of what he can offer with some breathtaking set pieces godzillas rampage through ginza is especially immersive the camera almost never pulling back to wide shots so that you feel endlessly caught up in the unspeakable destruction  minus one strikes a remarkable balance between sombre and epic with just a pinch of preposterousness to hark back to the cult favourites of the late 20th century the storyline deliberately evokes some of the original 1954 films elements concreting the sense that yamazakis triumph is more than worthy of the name few kaiju movies seem capable of giving you gargantuan thrills while ensuring that there is a deeply affecting political and human core to the story godzilla minus one is a welcome lesson on how to do exactly that
Dec 18 2023,positive, its a standalone and surprisingly lowbudget japanese blockbuster which sees the scaly icon go back to his roots its also the best godzilla movie ive seen made to celebrate the 70th anniversary of his movie debut the film swaps the bloke in the lizard suit for cuttingedge special effects which look at least 100million pricier than its rumoured 15m budget director and effects wizard takashi yamazaki plays to the big fellas strengths the trick is to make him utterly terrifying but a rampaging radioactive monster with killer breath isnt enough to hold anyones attention for two hours and yamazaki stirs in rousing human drama and chewy postwar politics our hero is koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a disgraced  in other words still alive  kamikaze pilot he ducked out of a suicide mission at the end of the second world war and afterwards returns to a bombedout tokyo where he is spat at by one of his neighbours his road to redemption begins when he forms a makeshift family with a bighearted survivor minami hamabe and an orphaned child but koichi is not only haunted by his refusal to die for his emperor but by a previous runin with the monster at the end of the war after hed sabotaged his engine he landed at an island fighter plane repair facility as a then mediumsized godzilla came ashore koichi had him in his machine guns sights but didnt shoot the beast went on to wipe out scores of engineers with a blast of his redhot breath so after a now beefedup godzilla flattens a tokyo neighbourhood koichi volunteers for a citizenled defence force the plan to defeat the evergrowing beast is ingenious and according to the exmilitary scientist in charge doesnt rely on unthinking selfsacrifice
Dec 18 2023,positive,you wouldnt believe a monster movie could make you sob as well as think but godzilla minus one does
Dec 17 2023,positive, ever since he first lumbered on to the big screen in ishiro hondas 1954 original film godzilla has been more than just a monster the citycrunching prehistoric megareptile has been cast as a metaphor for the nuclear threat american military might and environmental abuses he also represents a seemingly boundless franchise opportunity having appeared in almost 40 films of wildly varying quality of all these the terrific godzilla minus one is one of the very best written and directed by takashi yamazaki best known for scifi horror films parasyte parts 1 and 2 and the comedy drama always sunset on third street this thunderously entertaining prequel set in japan in the immediate aftermath of the second world war takes the king of monsters back to his roots in this version godzilla takes on a fresh metaphorical significance here he symbolises the national anguish trauma guilt and grief of the countrys postwar period his shape with its squat rump chunky thighs and a head that seems to be all jaws and no brains is immediately recognisable but this version of godzilla looks as though he was created from the stillsmouldering wreckage of japans shattered cities there are angry embers visible through the gaps between his scales his jagged dorsal plates look like the broken spines of bombedout buildings he is destruction and devastation pain and shame made flesh the other standardbearer for the collective torment of the japanese people is the films tortured central character kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki is a former kamikaze pilot the fact that he survived the inglorious end of the war is a constant reminder of his failure not only did he abort his suicide mission kōichi froze when he was first confronted by godzilla in a prelude to the main body of the film his hesitation  he fails to shoot at the creature for fear of drawing his deadly attention  indirectly costs the lives of almost the entire ground crew of an island airbase kōichi is trapped in the moment of his ignominy and cowardice unable to move on with his life because my war isnt over yet he finds himself part of a de facto family nonetheless  noriko minami hamabe a lightfingered girl dressed in rags moves in with him uninvited with an orphaned baby she rescued when the childs mother was killed in an air raid while kōichi doesnt feel worthy of marriage or love he steps up to the responsibilities its to provide for noriko and the infant akiko that kōichi takes a risky but wellpaid job manning the gun on a rickety wooden mineclearing boat working the coastal waters outside tokyo before long kōichi once again comes face to slavering jaws with his lizard nemesis but now godzilla having been bathed by radiation from the first bikini atoll nuclear test in 1946 is an altogether more formidable creature with the capacity to immediately regenerate from injury  and to burp out a devastating heat ray when irked the marine encounter with the newly beefedup godzilla is thrilling but when the creature hauls itself from the water and lays waste the ginza neighbourhood of tokyo where noriko has recently taken a desk job the film and the monster really hit their collective stride yamazaki pays tribute to several shots and scenes from the original 1954 film most notably in a dazzling sequence that opens with noriko gazing uncomprehending through the window of a suburban train as the looming bulk of the monster is reflected in the glass elsewhere akira ifukubes classic godzilla theme  with its relentless stomping rhythm one of the most distinctive pieces of film music ever written  is deployed to glorious effect godzilla minus one is unabashedly nationalistic and sentimental in approach pursuing a redemption narrative in which kōichi and japan are both offered the chance to reenter the field of battle and regain some dignity and selfrespect its a testament to the quality of writing and to the action direction that this never feels as corny or as crass as you might expect the country has valued life far too cheaply says one character a line that tacitly condones koichis failure as a kamikaze pilot pointedly its a civilianled operation that faces up to the monster peril rather than a government or an army mission the messaging its fair to say is not subtle but then this is a movie about a furious radioactive dinosaur trashing the commercial centre of tokyo who needs subtle
Dec 16 2023,positive,the technical quality of the effects is great so happily is the artistic quality
Dec 16 2023,positive, like star wars or superheroes godzilla as an entity is more than just pulp fantasy its appeal and resonance have crossed over into the world of modern myth these pop icons are often written off as throwaway entertainment when in reality their value and stature in our collective imagination have all but surpassed tales of gods and fairy stories of the past these are the new archetypes our way of communicating ideas for better or worse in the most universal and loudest way possible these new myths have never been more popular in our current era of mass fandom and exploitation of intellectual property despite this the ability to take these myths seriously seems to have been lost  godzilla minus one does not apologize for its ludicrous premise about a 20thcentury dinosaur with radioactive breath thats just the thing the film does not find its premise ludicrous in the least it is made by someone who loves the character just like millions of fans have for 70 years and rightfully this filmmaker has the utmost confidence in bringing the creature back to the theaters while it is a reboot that requires no background knowledge of the king of monsters extensive filmography godzilla minus ones director writer and special effects supervisor takashi yamasaki does not seem to feel the need to go out of his way to make a case for a godzilla movie in 2023 the film is confident and assured in this way godzilla minus one is a triumph of sincerity  more recent american action blockbusters which seem to rule many international markets often seem filled with a meta selfawareness that more or less points to trying to get as many people in seats as possible often filling nerd movies with borderline apologies for being nerdy there is little to no humor to be found in godzilla minus one no marvelesque moments where the filmmakers feel a neurotic need to speak directly to the more cynical audience members who think this is all stupid and silly why are they there in the theater in the first place in this way godzilla minus one feels refreshing as it silences the need for every serious moment to be undercut with a comedy relief character saying some postmodern quip like a dinosaur what is this jurassic park while far from being the first reboot of the franchise godzilla minus one is the first retelling to bring the story back to the postworld war ii era when the monster first debuted godzilla as an entity indeed became a big silly dinosaur and sometimes borderline superhero lizard see 1973s godzilla vs megalon in the decades that followed but when the monsters first film emerged from the depths in 1954 there was nothing silly to be found in a story of a nation still reeling and barely rebuilt from the horrors of the atomic bomb this is of course what the title minus one refers to  a crushed nation suddenly being pushed further into hopelessness  every character in yamazakis godzilla minus one however briefly they are developed is easy to empathize with because they all have this shared baggage and desperation in a seemingly hopeless world the main protagonist kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki is a pilot who deals with survivor guilt first from failing to die as a kamikaze pilot in world war ii and then from being one of the only survivors of the first attack by a strange dinosaurlike creature which serves as the films first major action sequence that only teases at the actual destruction that is to come the human story that inevitably makes up a good portion of any godzilla installment can help to make or break the experience quite often these aspects of the films become the weak points for fans offering little more than phonedin romance and endless board meetings full of samelooking military characters muttering about what they are going to do about this big lizard there is indeed a lot of human drama in godzilla minus one but rather than feeling like a chore it feels essential and gives weight to the monstrous spectacle in this way it is similar to the original 1954 classic making its metaphors and ideas flesh and blood through the emphasis on these broken characters who desperately wish for redemption and healing  in the first few years after the war our exkamikaze pilot kōichi stumbles into becoming a part of a found family amongst the rubble of a slowly recovering tokyo he reluctantly joins noriko minami hamabe a woman living on the streets despite having an uneasy relationship the two come together to take in an orphaned infant selfhating and haunted to the point of delusion kōichi attempts to support noriko and the child by joining the crew of a ship that ultimately runs into the king of monsters once more  a highspeed boat chase straight out of the best kind of spielberg action movie ensues and serves as our first look at this films iteration of godzilla in his true much larger and now atomic bombspewing form while diehard fans of the old rubber suit films and critics of cgi might long for practical effects the computergenerated godzilla we see here is something to behold unlike the more recent american iterations he looks less like some video game boss battle monster and more like a living breathing mountain of scales and spikes every shot godzilla enters gives our eyes a feast of details to observe yamazakis monster is true to the original conception a beast to be in awe of as well as a thing that clearly should not exist a thing that when you look in its large eyes seems to know it shouldnt exist almost as if its rampage is causing it pain rather than malevolent delight  when it is finally time for the beast to emerge slowly from the depths and begin to destroy tokyo it feels earned fresh and exhilarating rather than a simple rehash of a tried and true classic action sequence even amongst the explosive spectacle of the monsters sunset raid on tokyo more visual metaphor where we see buildings destroyed by atomic breath and trains munched by enormous jaws godzilla minus one continues to stay true to its focus which is almost always on the human cost that comes with the chaos how this monstrous spectacle devastates the main cast of wartime survivors sustains the film and resonates with the following struggles  while ishirô hondas original godzilla and hideaki anno and shinji higuchis wonderful 2016 remake shin godzilla present darker and more intellectual takes on the concept takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one stands out for being an uplifting approach to this ageold story if we might see the godzilla franchise as a body and why not these films have always thrived on metaphors godzilla minus one would be the franchises pounding heart serving as an allegory not just for the struggles that come with tragedy and defeat but for the hope and chance for rebirth that can be possible even in the aftermath of the unthinkable
Dec 16 2023,positive, the toho production is the sleeper hit of the seasonand a critical sensation too what separates it from the giantlizard stories weve telling stateside and what can other popcorn flicks learn from it years before the director ishiro honda started work on a lowbudget japanese horror film starring a giant isotopespewing lizard he hiked with the western allied powers through the wreckage of imperial japans brutal atomic collision in the charred city of hiroshima he had heard of the bomb but he had not seen it a veteran of three tours of duty in the japanese imperial army honda spent the last six months of world war ii in a prisoner of war camp in northern china hed witnessed firsthand the toll of the conflict in human livesmillions dead hundreds of thousands missing and woundedbut information was as scarce in captivity as comfort  when the war ended he was repatriated to occupied japan by route of nuclear ground zero what honda foundupon the land in the rivers among the citys depleted citizenry and the nations collective psychewas a worlds worth of scars not unlike the imprint of clothing which had been seared onto victims of the bomb he saw and never stopped seeing the battle after the war the fires of hiroshima and nagasaki were stanched the embers were not  theres a lot of tv out there we want to help every week well tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the everexpanding heap of peak tv godzilla the film that honda would go on to direct less than a decade later was a movie built as a reminder of the cost attached to nuclear power it was also very diy and i mean that in the best ways possible the lizard was a man in a readymixed concrete suit while immensely rough the creatures appearance was a collective endeavor between director and crew with a common aim i wanted honda admitted years later to make radiation visible thirtysix sequels later the most recent and most nostalgic entry in the franchise godzilla minus one has managed to strike us boxoffice gold and earn wordofmouth praise while holding on to its political roots  directed by the filmmaker and vfx maestro takashi yamazaki minus one takes place in the immediate aftermath of the second world war following koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a onetime kamikaze pilot haunted both by his decision to not sacrifice himself in combat and his inability to confront the titular green reptile after failing to stave off godzillas attack of a military installation on the fictional island of ono shikishima finds himself caught between his remorse over the wartime death of his loved ones his desire to protect his newfound family and his shame over fleeing his martial duties  debuting in japan in october the film arrived in the us on december 1 for what was supposed to be a limited theatrical run as of december 11 minus one has pulled in 26 million in american theaters and continues to have its run extended and expanded that all of this has occurred on a relatively shoestring budget and without an extensive us marketing campaign puts the film in perhaps the rarest of positions in a poststreaming theatrical marketplace a genuine diamondintherough hit and a hit with critics too as of publishing time minus one sits at 97 percent on rotten tomatoes better than oscar favorites like killers of the flower moon and oppenheimer and good enough to be the highestrated entry in the long godzilla canon minus one works not only because of its intent but also because of its lack of worldboxofficedominating intention at its core its a film thats fluent in the language of american spectacle with ambitions to go beyond it leading up to the movies release yamazaki spoke openly about the ways in which a blockbuster flick like jaws which minus one does a pretty decent impersonation of at timesor even a crossover darling like hayao miyazakis princess mononokewas a guiding light in building a narrative with the right amount of propulsion without overrelying on bloated set pieces these are films that made a shitload of money partly in spite of their artistic compasses minus one is not a movie about kaiju formulated to pad seat totals it is a kaiju movie about people andmuch the same as the 54 filmthose people are not americans the history of godzilla films being rearranged diluted and generally proffered in an attempt to attract us audiences is practically as old as the character when the original picture finally made it over to the states it was renamed king of the monsters in a ploy to link it to the alreadyestablished ip of king kong who i now realize coasts on counting stats and opposable thumbs it was reorganized around the flashbacks of a white american journalist played by the first perry mason and practically stripped of its explicit critiques of nuclear proliferation it worked but at what costs minus onein part because of the expansion in popularity of anime and in part because internment is decades and not years awayisnt just avoiding that fate its showing the fallacy in it to begin with  minus one isnt the first godzilla film with a bunch of callbacks to the original movie but its one of the few that manages to incorporate them without losing its own identity from the start of the picture where we see footage of the reallife bikini atoll nucleartesting site in the marshall islands its clear that minus one isnt afraid to be viewed as an atomic allegory the culmination of godzillas blue ray in the film is a literal mushroom cloud while promoting the movie yamazaki has said out of all the godzillas there have been throughout the years  my favorite is still the original from the very first movie hes running toward the comparisons  what helps minus one stick the landing is that it engages with the roots of the franchise without merely retreading old ground where hondas godzilla used genre to shroud a commentary on nuclear proliferation yamazakis movie like 2016s shin godzilla updates and retrofits the message a nod to the documentarystyle journalism of the first film coexists with a knotty multiact wrestling match with japanese postwar masculinity or a sly nuanced depiction of communal ptsd the defining feature of minus one the thing that links the old with the new is its general inclination toward probing the interpersonal relationships of its characters in ways that both the originals and the american remakes dont even consider doing there is the scene in which the lizard literally swallows a grown man in a half bite the one in which the lizard chucks an aircraft carrier like a k9 on adderall the part in which the lizard flicks a single train car onto a high rail platform like a toothpick the moment when the lizard takes at least seven shots from various tanks and then keeps on trucking like hes a collegeaged unclecousinsibling taking nerf gun fire like a champ  we have not mentioned that he gets a literal mine thrown under his tongue has half of his cerebellum jackson pollocked like scratchy then regrows it and gives them the and i took that personally glare or the fact that folks try to pop him like a balloon at the bottom of the ocean but cant because hes not fucking leaving descriptors for godzilla in minus one include but are not limited to snarling jagged bloody angry scary inflamed snarling again crystalline elemental and a force of nature that brothers starving  probably my favorite part of minus one is how it manages at once to take itself both incredibly seriously and not too seriously to be entertaining throughout is it a period piece about personal regret and communal grief what about a claymation semiaquatic thriller how can you affirm the innate value of human life and show a naval officer being disemboweled to really sink into the movie is to hold yourself in a state suspended between reality and surreality taskoriented plot mechanics exist next to veiled references to shintoism and it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it what weve got is a movie thats a little extra more than a bit heady and inescapably soapy at timeswhich i tend to think a

Dec 16 2023,positive, it is an astonishing feat that the godzilla franchise has reached its 37th iteration being the 5th one in the reiwa era and it never once feels oldfashioned wornout or quaint in the slightest one of the reasons that it has such an appealing longevity is because that the franchise is never afraid to be different in terms of shifts in tone prescience and adherence in continuity it is through these factors that filmmakers are free to portray the titular behemoth in however they please to satiate their creative juices in the case of japanese blockbuster filmmaker takashi yamazaki he has done just that with the latest iteration godzilla minus one yamazaki is best known for crowdpleasing blockbusters including space opera space battleship yamato 2010 the sciencefiction action flick returner 2002 the horror blockbuster parasyte films and the 3d animated film lupin iii  the first 2019 that are unapologetic in their melodrama ie the always sunset on third street trilogy and are audaciously overstated in their spectacle with extensive experience in animation and visual effects it seems like yamazaki is the perfect candidate for taking the reins of godzilla does he manage to succeed in keeping the bar high after the last japanese entry shin godzilla 2016 with a simple effective story welldeveloped characters a rousing sense of sheer spectacle and a powerfully emotional throughline godzilla minus one stands out as one of the best in its 59year run in the last iterations of godzilla the films had either focused on political commentary like the satirical views of bureaucracy under the topical views of natural disasters like shin godzilla or they had focused on sheer spectacle that delivered the rockem sockem action that western audiences had satiated for in the case of godzilla minus one directorscreenwriter yamazaki has gone back to the past in post wwii ie the showa era it avoids the satirical barbs that its predecessor had in terms of its portrayal of the japanese government and instead explores posttrauma of the war through our lead character koichi ryunosuke kamiki he is depicted as a kamikaze pilot who flees from his duty only to suffer from survivors guilt after seeing his comrades die by the hands of the titular creature the themes may be simplistic in nature but yamazaki and crew manage to tug the heartstrings capably well thanks to his sincere efforts in making us care for his characters themes like found families patriotism redemption and period depictions are nothing new to yamazaki especially as he depicts the tropes and themes with crowdpleasing sentimentality if not in cerebrally challenging ways one may see the film as a portrayal of the japanese making up for their defeat in the war as redemption or one may see the film as a characterbased path on fighting through survivors guilt and through patriotism they can settle their guilt and emotional baggage unfortunately yamazaki takes the easy way out and aims for an easily digestible approach that looks slightly banal after hideaki annos challenging approach to godzilla teary sentimentality and wellworn tropes they may be but ample time is spent on characterizations which makes them effective those include koichi as well as noriko a fellow survivor who lost her parents in the bombing of tokyo as well as kenji doc yoji captain and shiro kid who are all friends of koichi who work together in sweeping mines much like the themes themselves the characters may all appear simplistic that they almost seem to be homages  the crew that koichi works with seems to be intentionally spielbergian but a huge credit must be given to the actors who are fully committed to imbuing their roles with emotional vigour hidetaka yoshioka who has worked with yamazaki since his scifi fantasy directorial debut juvenile 2000 exudes a likable reticent charm as kenji doc while mimami hamabe who is having a great year with this and shin kamen rider 2023 is convincingly headstrong as noriko but aside from the titular creature the real standout is kamiki an acclaimed child actor who had matured into a skilled thespian in all walks of artistic ventures including animation in which he was scouted none other by hayao miyazaki himself to debut in spirited away 2001 liveaction films and theatre kamiki portrays the guilt trauma and conflict of koichi remarkably well and it is through his interactions and reactions to the world around him that makes his character and his predicaments worth caring for but what of godzilla you may ask the gman is depicted as an encapsulation of crippling fear and unbearable despair of postwwii anguish a force of nature that is absolutely frightening and undeniably angry with the visual effects supervised by yamazaki and longtime collaborator kiyoko shibuya they lend life to the creature through intimidating scale textures that signify battle scarsmushroom clouds and of course showing it in a predatorial state as it sneaks to its prey through water in a deliberate homage to steven spielbergs jaws 1975 the setpieces are terrifying as yamazaki is never afraid to show the consequences of godzillas actions as they are as opposed to being cheerworthy crowdpleasing spectacle human casualties are at an alltime high and are never brazen or overlooked in order to avoid alienating audiences the setpiece in ginza is a true highlight in showcasing the awesome might of godzilla and also critiquing how little the japanese government are involved in helping out their country in order to focus on not inciting tensions with the soviet union overall godzilla minus one is not only a topnotch godzilla film but one of the best blockbusters of the year a grand creature feature that that bellows and stomps on its competition with its compelling humanist core aweinspiring spectacle and its grounded approach to its characters highly recommended
Dec 15 2023,positive,  thanks for reading the tyee today  we hope this article added to your day in some way our team of independent journalists takes pride in doing indepth reporting and taking time to get it right   were able to focus our attention on publishing impactful journalism in the public interest and publish it for free for all to read because we have the support of tyee builders tyee builders are readers who contribute a bit of money  at a level and frequency of their choice  to support our editorial budget   this core of supporters  making up about 1 to 2 per cent of our daily readership  enables us to pay our writers keep our articles free and open to all and not bombard our readers with annoying ads while you try to read   instead of focusing on what kind of articles will attract the most advertising dollars we can spend time devoted to researching and writing stories that our readers find most valuable and make the most positive impact in our region   you made it all the way through the article  i hope that means you liked it or if not liked it gleaned some useful information from it tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work   listen ill get to the point  the article you just read was made possible because our nonprofit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it and we can only afford to do that because of our business model which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called tyee builders   the traditional business model for journalism in canada has been completely disrupted and were witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications lay people off and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy and it doesnt help that tech giant meta has blocked canadian news on their facebook and instagram platforms   between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit the tyee contribute financially but amazingly that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget and it means we can operate without a paywall too 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality factbased journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in bc alberta and across canada we think thats pretty remarkable  this year santa has blessed us undeserving humans with an unexpected bounty of gifts they arrive in the form of not one not two but three heaping helpings of godzilla the cinematic lizard king who first appeared on the silver screen in 1954  the defining subject of kaiju films a genre of japanese cinema involving giant monsters godzilla is stomping back onto screens as 2023 runs out the clock what we did to deserve this honour im not sure dont look a gift lizard in the mouth if you know whats good for you  every generation gets the godzilla they both need and deserve and the most recent iteration doesnt miss its a return to the original concept of retribution for hubris godzilla is back to remind us that we humans are not all that but uniting humanity in the face of gargantuan destruction is only one of the beasts many gifts  in addition to the importance of environmental stewardship and social cohesion godzillas towering height and overall hugeness are good reminders that we are puny little creatures we might be many but our overall significance in the universe is minuscule  also if we continue to degrade the natural world by dropping atomic bombs on things something bad might eventually happen godzilla is natures revenge personified or technically speaking lizardified born from the disruptive force of nuclear weapons he rises to remind us of what happens when we mess with things we ought not mess with  director takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one despite its headscratcher of a title is a sturdy and sometimes even thrilling throwback to the monster movies of yore after more than 37 outings since his 1954 cinematic debut godzilla is looking pretty good for an old dude he is still possessed of a desire to smash up buildings and bite commuter trains  his radioactive heat ray courtesy of the plates on his spine lights up with alacrity and his swimming skills remain olympian level on land hes always been something of a plodder but he uses it to his advantage squishing loads of squeaking humans with great efficiency  after so many different film and television versions of the monster one question remains does godzilla still have the juice to such a question i respond with a hell yes a little awe goes a long way and minus one has it in heaping quantities godzilla has undergone more career resets than cher and proves just as fabulous he is the original survivor but does minus one offer contemporary audiences another view of this iconic creature in short sort of  the story begins in the dregs of the second world war a kamikaze pilot named kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki fakes plane trouble to get out of certain death after landing his fighter jet on odo island the small crew of engineers led by chief mechanic tachibana munetaka aoki quickly ascertain that theres nothing wrong with the plane the fault lies with the pilot as the assembled engineers look on in disgust shikishima slinks away shame covering him like a shroud  later that night a massive dinosaurlike creature comes ashore frozen with terror shikishima fails to shoot the beast who makes quick and deadly business of the men chomping and stomping until only tachibana and shikishima remain from the rampage  after this bravura entrance godzilla stalks back into the sea and shikishima returns to the burntout hellscape that is postwar tokyo the stain of cowardice follows him but he rallies when a young woman named noriko minami hamabe and the orphaned baby girl she has rescued move in the trio set up house and become a family of sorts things take a turn for the brighter when shikishima gets a job on a minesweeper vessel and proves himself a worthy member of the small crew composed of a scientist a hoary old sea captain and young seamen  but peace does not last godzilla grown massive and even more angered by american nuclear tests returns and lays waste to ginza this scene alone is worth the price of admission as the bass thunder fusillade that is the great lizards theme music kicks into gear a genuine sense of dread and awe ensues it is a rare feeling in this cinematic period when every marvel cinematic universe movie is doing its utmost to foster such a reaction and often proving wildly underwhelming here it just works  whether its the nearobliterating scale of destruction or the fact that godzilla seems genuinely enraged something unusual happens in this sequence the ubiquity and familiarity we have with the character retreats and we see him for what he originally stood for a symbol of ultimate destruction unleashed war itself  there are plenty of culturally specific details in minus one beginning with the films title that refers to postwar japan when reduced to a state of nullity with the entrance of godzilla the country and its people are pushed to less than zero  references to the failure of the government to support its citizens and the hypocrisy and waste of the war effort in everything from jet fighters that lacked even the most basic safety measures to the inability to organize a counterattack when tokyo is levelled are all marched out with little fanfare its the ordinary people who pull together to mount a resistance yelling at the top of their lungs for almost the entirety of the action i love a good yeller of a film and this one is a corker the stage is set for a final showdown between human cleverness and brute strength in the bay of tokyo sacrifice courage and community all come together to send the beast packing but the film ends on a strangely ominous note you may defeat him but hes never truly gone he will rise again until we learn to stop brutalizing each other  so take your medicine humanity a spanking from the bussized paw of an enormous scaly symbol the deified lizard we deserve a dose of mighty justice and thats what godzilla provides god may be dead but godzilla lives  further to the provision of the personal information protection act personal information is kept confidential by

Dec 15 2023,positive,you definitely feel for all these characters and and the choices that they make and that adds a surprising amount of like emotional heft to what could have just been a thrilling but a purely exciting escapist action film
Dec 15 2023,positive, godzilla is a monster that just refuses to go quietly into that good night time and again filmmakers return to the citysmashing lizard sorry kaiju to try and conjure up its magic and time and again they fail since 1998 there have been four hollywood movies featuring the socalled king of the monsters with a fifth godzilla x kong the new empire arriving in april the big lumps 70th birthday it also appears in monarch legacy of monsters a series that landed on apple tv last month none of them really set the world alight in japan however its a whole different level  with the monster first appearing in a 1954 movie in which it attacked tokyo after being awakened by hbomb testing all the way up to the 30th live action film which lands this week godzilla minus one this really shows hollywood how its done this latest film has stripped the format back to its roots set it shortly after the second world war with a load of social messages and ladled on lashings of the monster  no holding back for a slow reveal here and in doing so the filmmakers have conjured up a thoroughly entertaining thoughtprovoking blockbuster at a fraction of the cost of any of its hollywood counterparts  supposedly it was made for just 15m written and directed by acclaimed filmmaker takashi yamazaki this has real flair mixing a wonderfully realised period setting with proper emotional depth and a monster that absolutely looks the part the part of knocking over skyscrapers with its tail and munching on train carriages the title is a reference to post war japan being reduced to zero and then according to the production notes when godzilla shows up it plunges the country into a negative state japan is on its knees how will it respond well for one thing the filmmakers make clear theres not much point looking to its government there is an antipoliticspoliticians message running through the film  one character says this country has treated life far too cheaply which backs the citizens instead to band together formulate a plan and somehow destroy this relentless seemingly unstoppable force  at the heart of the tale is koichi played by ryunosuke kamiki a man wracked with guilt after he decides against completing a kamikaze mission during the second world war instead landing on an island with a group of engineers up pops godzilla killing everyone except him and one other who blames him for not opening fire on the monster with some heavy artillery back on the mainland trying to cope with the disgrace he feels at failing to carry out his kamikaze mission and indeed stopping godzilla he meets minami hamabes noriko who is looking after a baby orphaned during the war  the bond grows between these outcasts and they create something of a misfit family but their happiness is short lived as the big lizard comes storming back smashing up everything in its way the people come up with a plan and koichi sees the chance for redemption this film clearly has a deep love of godzilla and the characters history and the camera lingers on the monster  giving the audience what it wants  in great detail a marvel with those budget restrictions up close from afar underwater the great kaiju is gloriously recreated but it is also crucially a film that has an emotional heart and with central characters you can root for this is a film about rebuilding out of destruction about friends families and communities standing together to face implacable forces that threaten them and it is about second chances also its a ruddy great romp its explosive heart pumping stuff steeped in the films lore and does justice to one of movie historys most iconic monsters
Dec 15 2023,positive, ever since ishirô hondas prolific 1954 film godzilla the titular kaiju has starred in multiple films that vary from exploring the impact humanity has had on its own environment and society to the campy battle royales between gargantuan beasts humanity has always been involved in these stories and in some cases the complaint is that theres not enough godzilla gareth edwards 2014 film godzilla received many complaints along those lines what is surprising about takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one is not that its focused on the human side of conflict but that it manages to do that while reminding audiences what makes godzilla so terrifying its not just a monster its a mirror image of society and the perpetual war machine that destroys it over and over set in postwar japan amid tensions between the united states and the soviet union godzilla minus one pulls no punches when addressing the political climate and general hesitancy to protect its people from future conflicts opening at the tailend of world war ii koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki makes a sudden landing on odo island to have his plane repaired a kamikaze pilot with second thoughts the disgrace to his country is outweighed by his desire not to die however he bears the burden of death anyway as the entire island is attacked by a mysterious monster  named godzilla by the local inhabitants somehow surviving the attack he returns home to tokyo only to discover his family was killed by a series of air raid bombings launched by the united states  traumatized by the attack on odo island and the wreckage he has returned to in tokyo koichis despair is alleviated temporarily by a runin with noriko minami hamabe a survivor of the air raids who swore to take care of a mothers child when evacuating koichi now finds himself sharing his home with noriko and the two form a bond out of their shared loneliness to make ends meet koichi joins a small group of exmilitary personnel who are now acting as minesweepers going through the ocean and removing submerged mines now that the war is over however the peace that allows for japan to heal and rebuild is interrupted by the return of godzilla who is now massive and angry thanks to the nuclear tests done by the united states at bikini atoll  right from the outset it is clear that yamazakis screenplay has a lot to say about japans government and the way soldiers are convinced that the best way to help their country is through sacrifice koichis fateful introduction to godzilla is one where he shouldnt have even been there he should have been dead throughout the opening scene hes given multiple moments to throw his life on the line and he freezes each and every time its perceived as a failure to his country to his familys honor and to himself flashes of the attack now haunt him throughout the film and he struggles to separate his life from godzillas had he acted on odo island could he have stopped godzilla emotionally stirring as it is with an arc that tugs on heartstrings far more effectively than most would expect from a kaiju film godzilla minus one is also an outright spectacle the scale is tremendous to behold and combined with naoki satôs updating of the iconic godzilla theme music becomes this monolithic force of nature as godzillas havoc threatens japans infrastructure its met with a surprising lack of retaliation hes unstoppable and the japanese government does not want to burden the rest of the world with its problems so it seems to do almost nothing that the major conflict in godzilla minus one ends up being between the intimidating scale and force of godzilla and private citizens forced to act when their government refuses shows a complete disregard for human life and a countrys own citizens during wartime its not the people that theyre worried about losing its the infrastructure or the alliances this also explains why a lot of godzilla minus ones action takes place at sea with that comes incredibly detailed setpieces designed to highlight the scale of its monster and the tense inevitability that nothing can stop godzilla from coming ashore it also emphasizes lives lost a little more clearly than letting godzilla create wanton destruction throughout the city streets when he takes down a building the loss is only felt if humans are shown in danger  too often we see buildings destroyed during evacuations and its now commonplace that they have to show us someone being crushed by its debris if it takes out a small fishing boat in a vast empty sea the loss is more clearly indicated that boat isnt just infrastructure its someones livelihood and didnt just drift out to sea it results in something far more harrowing but also surrounds koichi with a constant reminder of his guilt about odo island godzilla isnt just an enemy force at this point and takes on the physical embodiment of koichis guilt  a guilt spurred on by a government that assigned him to die a pilot and the countrys citizens that turned their back on him when he failed to do so again yamazakis screenplay packs so many ideas into it that its easy to see godzilla representing one thing versus another depending on the context and the person youre talking to about it at first the film seems to be about selfpreservation and then it spirals into a ptsdridden reminder of the horrors of war until its a powerful statement on the will to live  something that can have potency from both koichi and godzillas perspective if kaiju destruction is what you crave out of your godzilla films godzilla minus one delivers a disaster epic worthy of the characters legacy that alone would be enough to make godzilla minus one a stellar addition to the prolific franchise however yamazaki goes further to cement godzilla minus one as the best godzilla film since 2016s shin godzilla and stands tall alongside hondas monumental classic 
Dec 15 2023,positive, godzilla minus one the highestgrossing liveaction japanese film of all time in america understands one very key fact about godzilla that so many godzilla movies forget godzilla is terrifying while the various urges of commercial filmmaking command time and again that godzilla becomes a hero fighting off even nastier monsters and defending mankind from destruction while generating respectful awe rather than overt terror the simple fact of the matter is that godzilla is a pure nightmare blown up to gigantic proportions just think of the beast in your minds eye hes a skyscrapersized lizard who shoots atomic blue fire from his throat that results in catastrophic atomicstyle detonations having him show up in your neighborhood would ruin your whole week maybe even your month even if he wasnt trying to hurt people the simple mechanics of his body movements would lay waste to whole city blocks a twitch of the tail would obliterate a tenement every step would crush a school bus full of nuns andor cheerleaders all of which is to say that godzilla minus ones opening moments feature some of the most impressively visceral godzilla action in recent years following the return to odo island of koichi ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot whose cowardice prevented him from carrying out his suicide mission godzilla leaps from the ocean and annihilates the small crew of airmen and mechanics stationed on the island given a second opportunity to prove his braveryby leaping into the airplane and turning its machine guns on the monsterkoichi again quails running for cover instead good thing godzilla isnt messing around hes here to kill the intruders in his territory and bullets arent likely to have much of an effect fastforward a couple of yearsfollowing reconstruction efforts in japan as koichi builds a life with the homeless noriko minami hamabe and the young orphan girl akiko sae nagatani and godzilla soaks up some radiation courtesy of the americans at bikini atolland the monster is back bigger and meaner than ever laying claim to much of the japanese sea and demolishing gargantuan battleships with little more than a swipe of his claws the godzilla seen in later sequences is a little slower but much larger and even more indestructible at one point the titanic lizard is swimming through the water after koichi and his minesweeper crews boat halfsubmerged halfvisible entirely terrifying neither machine guns nor mines can stop the brute and death seems certain though their tiny wood boat is saved at the last minute the nearencounter drives home the sheer scale of godzilla when he sets foot in ginza viewers and residents alike cant help but gawp at the size of the beast we see most of the action from ground level his tail speeding through streets and buildings like a blunted scythe slashing through wheat the dull blade harvesting ragged chunks of city street unlike the boy and the heron the other japanese film sharing space on american box office charts and discussed on this weeks across the movie aisle the symbolism in godzilla minus one is relatively straightforward rather than being a symbol of americas nuclear might godzilla himself antedates the war and represents the japanese governments inability to be honest with its citizens about their place in the world a monstrous iteration of the governmentsand the citizenrysbelief that the japanese should fight to the last man regardless of the untenability of their situation the government is not just useless to stop the giant lizard it actively misinforms the people leaving them vulnerable to godzillas wrath men like koichi are made to feel as though they are cowards for failing to die in the doomed effort to stop the onslaught but the people are stronger than their feckless leaders pulling together in their time of darkness to win the day stop the beast save their cities and yadda yadda yadda godzilla minus one is a big terrifying piece of melodrama the blockbuster flourishes spaced out enough to give the heartfelt some might sneer overly wrought emotion at the pictures core space to breathe one thing i wasnt entirely expecting how much godzilla minus ones final act owes to recent christopher nolan pictures yes yes the whole thing about the irradiated monster wreaking havoc is a secret sequel to oppenheimer har har but there are indisputable flashes of dunkirk and the dark knight rises in the climactic sequence and the whole thing is done with a similar combination of heartfelt and heartpounding crosscutting weaving points of view and action spectaculars and stirring parental emotional beats together with aplomb
Dec 15 2023,positive,if monarch legacy of monsters left you wanting more godzilla godzilla minus one scratches that itch and then some 
Dec 13 2023,positive, a lot of people have said this but i agree the new godzilla movie has a much better grasp of both storytelling and action filmmaking than probably 95 percent of what hollywood has been churning out lately it has clear stakes it knows how to set up and pay off emotional beats and for the majority of the action sequences you can see whats going on revolutionary i know its the last of several movies this year to come out of nowhere and truly engage with audiences  when it comes to actionadventure it was the longinthetooth franchises that came through all doing very innovative things the three best action movies i saw in 2023 were the fourth john wick the seventh mission impossible and the 37th godzilla  film critic vince mancini whose podcast the filmdrunk frotcast has been one of my favorites for many years is now writing a substack called the content report and i encourage you all to subscribe hes got reviews but also some firstrate analysis of where content and the internet are today  once i was forced out of the media brand i helped to build it was clearer than ever that i essentially had zero control over what happened to virtually my entire portfolio and the evidence of my working life for more than 15 years i created it but i dont own it and i dont get any say on what happens to it which was mostly true even when i still worked there ive come to rely on google and my past work as much as my own brain when it comes to trying to remember what movies i saw in 2012 or my interests in 2017 conde nast did a bunch of layoffs earlier this month and ensnared among them was humorist andy borowitz author of the new yorkers the borowitz report humor column  your conservative uncles might go on facebook every day and share conspiracy theories and racist memes but its your liberal uncles who share something arguably even more horrifying andy borowitz columns borowitz for the last several years has been posting the most witless obvious bitefree political satire the new yorker purchased his website the borowitz report in 2012 for this for years he was rewarded with a nearly permanent spot at the top of the magazines mostread stories list often overtaking some of the best reporting from some of the best journalists in the world also most of the great journalists who you think of as new yorker writers are not employees of the magazine borowitz it appears was  among borowitzs final pieces for the new yorker are george santos to spend more time with imaginary family ivanka unable to remember name of her father and clarence thomas collapses from exhaustion after first full day of regulating himself forget trump abortion and israel americas greatest divide may be between those who think andy borowitz is funny and those who dont if youre left of center and your parents are still alive chances are they love him i think he makes mark russell look like bill hicks  borowitz despite the layoff should be okay for money and thats because in case you didnt realize he is also the cocreator of the fresh prince of bel air sure the show wasnt his idea he and his thenwife were essentially assigned to executive produce it and he only worked on it for the first season but i imagine hes collected a massive amount of royalties from that over the years  lear who died this week at the age of 101 had the longest and most prolific career of any tv producer writer and creator in history making such shows as all in the family good times maude sanford and son the jeffersons and many more several of which were spinoffs of others  throughout lears work was stridently political and progressive and probably the best possible version of that particular style everyone remembers how different audiences got different things out of the character of archie bunker but lear was never afraid to make a political statement  often a controversial one  with his work  lears career as a tv writer began in the 1940s when he was in his 20s and he continued to have credits well into his 90s executive producing the great one day at a time reimagining that started in 2017  pluto tv this week is running marathons of several of the lear shows and the great 2016 documentary norman lear just another version of you can be rented from amazon and apple hopefully pbs which ran it a while back will air it again soon  last week after george santos was expelled from congress political writer josh barro wrote a brilliant political obituary fitting santos into a republican party that he sees as dominated by high camp miscreants like donald trump kari lake and marjorie taylor greene who stand on the shoulders of the homosexuals who created the trashy reality tv aesthetic they are living out it seems you can be a gay republican or you can be a messybitchwholivesfordrama republican but being both at the same time remains a bridge too far for many conservatives or maybe the way to put it is that republican voters growing tolerance for crime by politicians does not extend to extremely gay crimes like stealing campaign funds to pay for botox we have made much progress toward equality but this shows that there is always more work to be done santos of course has been compared to a bravo villain but andy cohen has gone on record that he doesnt want santos on his network though were his crimes any worse than those of teresa giudice however the excongressman may be headed to another cable network yes hbo  could this result in a good movie who knows theres certainly plenty of material there but santos story is one of those so overthetop that its hard to imagine a fictional story topping the real thing this is one of those projects where theyll probably have to cut out some of his crimes for time this week here at the substack i reviewed poor things and crowned it the best movie of the year reviewed matt singers book about siskel and ebert looked back on the 10th anniversary of inside llewyn davis and reviewed the documentary we live here the midwest  for the jewish telegraphic agency i went through the most jewish moments in barbra streisands new memoir my name is barbra the story also got picked up by the forward and the jerusalem post  for appleinsider its the latest crime blotter i appear to have beaten most of the world to that story about a thief refusing to take his victims

Dec 13 2023,positive, theres a certain formula to most genre films especially monster movies like those belonging to the godzilla franchise where the kaiju is the real star of the film human characters are essentially along for the ride able to soak up large chunks of the runtime while serving as useful cannon fodder for the carnage the audience is there to witness few filmmakers working in the space dare to treat their human characters as people cutting corners toward an inevitable destination amongst an ocean of forgettable watchable bmovies godzilla minus one the 37th liveaction release in the franchise and 33rd produced by toho studios in japan a company that owes practically its entire success to the titular sea monster understands its place as the titan of the kaiju genre the original 1954 godzilla still holds tremendous power for its social commentary on a country still reeling from the fallout of nuclear war there will always be a certain novelty in watching a stunt double in a rubber suit kicking down prop buildings but the underpinning of this franchises success is how bleakly raw its messaging can be when the series takes itself seriously minus one takes the series back to its world war ii roots centering its narrative on kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot who abandoned his duties instead faking plane difficulties to land on odo island in the pacific toward the end of the war shikishima bears witness to godzilla ravaging the island horrors only matched by the carnage left on the mainland after the atomic bomb was dropped returning home bearing the mark of a coward shikishima starts to rebuild his life by taking in a woman noriko minami hamabe into his home along with a small baby she found abandoned in a landscape with few survivors shikishima finds work as a minesweeper bonding with his crewmates while learning to live with his guilt a few years later the military starts to prepare for godzillas inevitable return keeping the broader public in the dark even under the bleak outlook director takashi yamazaki peppers the narrative with vital social commentary about the failures of the japanese government to adequately relay information in the tumultuous 1940s largely leaving citizens on their own to survive in an environment still reeling from some of the worst cruelties mankind has ever wrought upon itself minus one succeeds through its courage to earnestly invest in exploring the rich complexities of humanity a gamble few blockbusters dare to make if that wasnt enough yamazaki also delivers elite practical effects this is a film that deeply respects the people who came to spend time in its playground it seems almost foolish to sing such high praises for attributes such as a good script superb acting and toptier visuals but such elements are often missing from cinema in the year 2023 beyond just the sheer caliber of the bread and butter filmmaking minus one is a richly optimistic narrative too many modern blockbusters rest their laurels on largerthanlife heroes with no grounding in human struggles yamazaki puts his films entire stock in people everyday humans with flaws who ultimately stare unimaginable odds dead in the face and fight on anyway 2023 has been a bleak year amidst a broader sea of hopelessness across our modern landscape it really does often feel like it sucks to be alive in this modern era cinema isnt just supposed to provide mindless escapism the beauty of the big screen lies in its power to transform the mindsets of the people who paid a bit of money to take a seat for a journey to a world with fresh perspectives and new ideas the beauty of art is to remind us that even if the shining city on a hill is going to be an uphill climb it is our narrative arc as humanity to break our baser instincts and fight on for a world worth living in though its 125minute runtime could have used a scene or two shaved off its somewhat bloated third act yamazaki has produced one of the best films of the year were living in a precarious time for the industry as so many other mediums vie for consumers attention godzilla minus one is a breathtaking tourdeforce for the power of cinema itself a muchneeded reminder of how good it feels to sit in a movie theater when studios actually invest in work that respects the humanity of its audience five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up 
Dec 13 2023,positive, anyone who has the temerity to write off godzilla fucking godzilla as a spent force of franchise filmmaking will need to backtrack right now on the evidence of takashi yamazakis ripsnorting historical action epic godzilla minus one theres still some nuclearpowered juice in the lumbering metaphorical lizard yet the industrious director who also wrote the screenplay and collaborated on the very slick special effects work strips the story back to basics keeping context and exposition to a minimum and leaning on robust timeworn plot mechanics that focus on delivering chunky thrills the filmmaker has been open in interviews about his love of steven spielberg and christopher nolan and the evidence is up there on screen but he has not pilfered their stylistic tics but more their supreme storytelling tactics and the slow intense buildup to a big finale its a back to basics film which replays the story with a very straight bat and it seems that the weird variations on the godzilla mythos see 2016s shin godzilla have been swept aside from something more purely entertaining its 1945 in japan and things are not going well on the world war two front to put it mildly even the kamikaze pilots are finding excuses to not sacrifice their lives for what they now see as a lost cause  such is the case with pilot kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki who lands his plane on an island service base complaining of machine faults as a way to shirk his nationalistic responsibility unlucky for him and the gang of engineers who take him in godzilla decides to roll up from the sea and pay them a smashysmashy visit which results in widespread murder shikishima scared out of his wits doesnt have the nerve to fire upon the beast from the cockpit of his downed plane and is thus blamed for the wipeout back in tokyo and racked with guilt he takes in a woman and her orphan child and decides to join a crew of seabound mine sweepers in order to pay his  and their  way its not long before hes got some more facetime with his scaly heat rayblasting pal who it transpires can selfheal from all the heavy ordinance fire it takes its after this second big action set piece that the touchpaper is lit for a grand climax which plays out in classic heist movie style we hear the details and justifications for the madcap plan to destroy godzilla in immaculate detail and then must palmsweat intensely as it all precariously plays out the film and its subtexts all say one thing dont prod the monster godzilla in its defence only reacts violently when humans start to shoot at it and the same lesson can be taken when it comes to nuclear diplomacy in the postwar period although one may question the notion suggested here that japan entirely brought on their problems when it came to the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki yet yamazakis film works as a perfect entry point to the franchise and doesnt require any prior knowledge of godzilla or his citylevelling pals its precisiontooled in terms of structure almost to the point of airlessness but youd be hardpressed to knock back the final 45minute showdown as anything less than an impressive feat by a filmmaker orchestrating and charting the fine processes of an epic battle little white lies was established in 2005 as a bimonthly print magazine committed to championing great movies and the talented people who make them combining cuttingedge design illustration and journalism weve been described as being at the vanguard of the independent publishing movement our reviews feature a unique tripartite ranking system that captures the different aspects of the moviegoing experience we believe in truth  movies  little white lies was established in 2005 as a bimonthly print magazine committed to championing great movies and the talented people who make them combining cuttingedge design illustration and journalism weve been described as being at the vanguard of the independent publishing movement our reviews feature a unique tripartite ranking system that captures the different aspects of the moviegoing experience we believe in truth  movies
Dec 13 2023,positive, there are bazillions of godzilla films out there both from japan and the us and this latest contribution to the franchise is one of the very best its up there with the original 1954 film the clever reboot from a few years ago shin godzilla and my personal favourite godzilla vs the smog monster aka godzilla vs hedorah 1972 which rocks because it has extras in white gogo boots headtrip sequences and in the english dubbed version a kicker of a theme song called save the earth however like the other two aforementioned great godzilla films this one works because it puts the trauma of history at the very centre of the story ultimately crafting a story about human beings pulling together to heal and defeat an inexplicable force of destruction minus one starts in the very last days of the second world war a uniquely bleak moment in japanese history protagonist shikishima ryunosuke kamiki is supposed to fly a kamikaze mission but overcome by fear and an understandable desire to live he lands on odo island a deep cut from godzilla lore to fix a madeup engine failure godzilla a monster familiar to the locals attacks and kills nearly everyone on the island and once again fear stops shikishima from fighting back shikishima returns to a tokyo burned and smashed to smithereens by the allied firebombing to find his parents dead his home a pile of matchsticks nevertheless he builds a makeshift family of sorts with a young woman called noriko minami hamabe who also lost everything and a baby akiko adorably played by sae nagatani later as a threeyearold whom noriko was charged with looking after when she saw akikos mother die in a bomb shelter years pass and this little nuclear family looks poised to benefit from the postwar phoenixlike recovery of the nation but there are other kinds of nuclear force at play here especially in the bikini atoll where the hbomb is tested in the original godzilla movie the big bad horror was the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki by oppenheimer and cos abomb along with anxieties about the nuclear testing in the pacific cited in the film as a contributing factor to godzillas genetic mutation in the contemporaryset shin godzilla the fault lies with institutions and international relations but an efficient marshalling of those same apparatuses is instrumental along with a knowledge of origami to defeat godzilla either way in all three the saviour is most certainly not some deus ex monstera like king kong or similar  a move particularly favoured by the american godzilla films instead in godzilla minus one the most effective means to counteract godzilla involves private citizens tellingly not the government pulling together voluntarily to pool knowledge and form an effective chain of command to science the crap out of stopping him for long stretches shikishima and noriko practically disappear into the background apart from one especially wrenching moment when theyre caught up in the bigfooted lizards destruction of ginza director takashi yamazaki masterfully tightens and loosens the emotional screws throughout abetted by a stunning throbbing minimalist score by naoki satô yamazaki also knows how to play with scale moving between the intimacy of the little family and their fragile lives and the almost incomprehensible scale of the monster capable of swishing away whole city blocks with a flick of his tail this is not a cuddly version of godzilla he is rageful and entirely incomprehensible seemingly not even motivated by hunger desire or revenge like a god he just is an entity that has become death the destroyer of worlds as ineluctable as history itself
Dec 12 2023,positive, godzilla minus one is the first modern godzilla film to come along that feels spiritually connected to the original movie from 1954 it could pass as a reboot with moments like the train sequence feeling like both a throwback and a contemporary update but its so much more in 1945 during the last days of world war ii a kamikaze pilot named koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki suzume landed on odo island claiming his aircraft malfunctioned that night a dinosaurlike beast locals call godzilla attacks and kills everyone except for koichi and tachibana munetaka aoki the roundup no way out the lead mechanic a year later koichi returns home only to find out that his parents have died in the bombing of tokyo he gets a job as a minesweeper to support a woman named noriko minami hamabe shin kamen rider and an orphaned little girl named akiko sae nagatani still haunted by fleeing from his duty as a kamikaze pilot during the war and the men who died on odo island koichis guilt hits rock bottom when godzilla returns mutated and much bigger than before as godzilla begins carving a wave of destruction towards tokyo and military weapons do not stop him its up to the civilians with war experience to formulate a plan that will hopefully keep the unstoppable monster from destroying the rest of japan while the original film capitalized on the war godzilla minus one picks up as the war ends and japan is at its lowest as godzilla strikes japanese defenses are at their weakest or practically nonexistent with nothing at their disposal they have to rely on outside forces to attempt to stand toetotoe with godzilla it is their job to stall for time and all they can do is sit watch and die once the monster steps ashore its mesmerizing but its also absolutely terrifying godzilla goes through changes again to reach colossal proportions but he has a minor evolution compared to shin godzilla with only two different forms in minus one as a youngling godzilla is smaller and faster and moreover the atomic bomb is seemingly still the cause of its birth  perhaps in both instances the sequences of it stomping and trashing things are as devastating as they are sorrowfully impressive  the camp associated with the rubber suit days is a distant memory and likewise the godzilla here seems like a far skreeonnkk away from the monsterverse counterpart humans are these annoying obstacles to monstrous destruction in those films while most of the kaiju know how to smash yet dont have as much cause or anger behind the devastation there are some aweinspiring godzilla sequences in minus one beginning with its atomic breath wiping out cities instantly leaving godzilla smoldering seeing that blue wave slowly migrate up the fins of its tail to the back of its head is executed in a refreshing and harrowing way the boat chase is a thing of beauty as well godzilla swallowing explosive mines that are then shot at by the mineexterminating boat crew results in one of the most exhilarating sequences ever realized in the franchise the cast doesnt phone in either seeing minus one you are witness to a onceinalifetime instance of a unique big monster movie where humans are as intriguing as the creature you feel invested in koichis inability to escape the war and godzillas indestructibility on the home front koichi and noriko arent romantically involved and akiko isnt related to either but the bold writing choice pays off the human characters can each live their own lives rather than always make joint decisions or always be in the same place together at once the fact that godzilla shows up and the fight against him brings the surrogate family back together makes the film all the more fascinating the cinematography by kozo shibasaki helps give the impression that godzilla is this inevitable force of nature  the rampages feel intimate and make the audience feel like theyre part of a terrifying hysteria perspectivewise you often look up at godzilla as he stomps on unsuspecting people or bites down on them and hurls them into the sky godzilla minus one is not only one of the best films out of the 30plus in the series but also one of the best films of the year the acting is superb the destruction is immense and incredible and the gnarly godzilla design is fantastic its ridiculous if true that this film only has a budget of 15 million because it looks better than most hollywood blockbusters
Dec 12 2023,positive, everythings a performance in cowriterdirectorstar bradley coopers decadesspanning leonard bernstein biopic maestro from coopers muchdebated prosthetic schnoz to the screwball pace of the clipped dialogue to the way the film jumps between gorgeous blackandwhite and rich colour bernsteins life is presented almost as if its one big show its exuberant protagonist feeding hungrily off the energy of anyone in his orbit its an appropriate way to approach such a towering figure best remembered these days for composing west side story but in his day a cultural colossus who helped make classical music accessible to the masses the film presents him as a musical polymath a restless spirit whose enormous success as a conductor teacher and television personality risked undermining his development as a composer  the addictive pull of his public persona in constant battle with the introspection required to create great work his personal life was no less schizophrenic he was a man of omnivorous sexual appetites unapologetically drawn to men and women never personally tortured by his sexuality but leaving a trail of emotional devastation in his wake not least his wife and muse the costa ricaborn stage actress felicia montealegre played with brittle austerity by carey mulligan shes introduced to lenny everyone calls him lenny at a cocktail party but in a portent of the marriage to come cooper has them fall in love on a literal stage  performative heterosexuality destined to be enacted many times over with less and less conviction as the years go by the early parts of the film are awash with dazzling flights of fancy that merge this nascent marital arrangement with lennys fizzing creativity yet it soon becomes apparent cooper is less interested in bernsteins art than he is in tracking lennys growing disinterest in containing the chaos caused by his creative and sexual duality mostly this plays out in relation to felicia at one crucial performance for instance we see her edged into the wings a shadowy figure no longer basking in the spotlight of his attention when the films second half jumps ahead in time and to colour discretion goes out the window with cooper framing one terrible domestic argument against the backdrop of a thanksgiving day parade replete with a giant snoopy inflatable drifting by their lavish apartment even marital discord is conducted with flair the basic point cooper seems to be circling is that their relationship was complex whatever deal felicia made with herself to overlook her husbands bisexuality she also understood that he needed her more than he realised we dont learn much more about her than this nothing certainly about her politics or the activism so mercilessly mocked for posterity by tom wolfe in his infamous essay radical chic nevertheless cooper builds the films musical climax around bernsteins implicit realisation that the virtuosic performance of mahlers symphony no 2 that he conducted at ely cathedral in 1973 was only possible because of what felicia gave him even if its never clear what exactly that was shot in a single sixminute take the scene itself is a tour de force and had cooper ended the film there maestro would have brought the house down but in deference to mulligan what should have been a line or two of epigraphical text detailing felicias fate is instead transformed into an extended coda of oscarbating awfulness underscoring her martyrdom to her marriage we get scene after scene of her decline from cancer all of it beatifically rendered with wan smiles and decorous headscarves these are swiftly followed by more scenes of cooper in crinkly oldage makeup still joyful yet haunted now by all that hes lost rems bernsteinreferencing its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine needledropped inevitably onto the soundtrack its a bit much a performance too far basking in the false glory of a selfgenerated ovation unlike hollywoods recent desecration of godzilla with those marvelinspired monsterverse movies franchise originator toho studios latest domestic take godzilla minus one serves up a more tactile monster one whose wanton destruction has more impact as a result a lovingly conceived throwback to the original its set in the immediate aftermath of world war ii with much of japan decimated by war and godzilla supersized by nuclear testing wreaking havoc on the country at the lowest point in its history mercifully the film takes a lighttouch approach to using its star as an offthepeg allegory for processing historical trauma delivering instead blockbuster thrills with the visual panache of a modern effects extravaganza and some of the pastiching charm of the beastie boys intergalactic video given her characters titular billing its disappointing that the three musketeers milady isnt a full blown showcase for eva greens take on alexander dumas treacherous femme fatale instead of moving front and centre in this concluding instalment of martin bourboulons twopart revamp of dumass tale of swashbuckling derring do shes still playing second fiddle to françois civils dartagnan if youve not seen that first part released earlier this year its probably best to acquaint yourself with it though the tale is familiar enough to get the gist either way the allstar supporting cast among them vincent cassel romain duris and vicky krieps makes this even easier on the eye but when greens on screen it really comes alive her vampish villainy giving this resolutely oldfashioned film a glamorous dangerous edge
Dec 12 2023,positive, for a film series that has severed into various franchise strands over the past seventy years its fantastic that godzilla has finally been reborn into a form thats both refreshing for viewers and comparable to beloved past embodiments despite the surface central conceptdraw of big monster smashes city godzilla has famously teemed with metaphors and allegories relating to japans posthiroshima and nagasaki fear of nuclear weapons and atomic devastation so with this latest instalment being set in mid postwar tokyo mid 1945 makes godzillas origins more pertinent to the plot and characters than most of its recent predecessors the story follows koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot who lands on the armyoccupied odo island to get his plane repaired but when no mechanical faults are found our hero is brandished a coward koichi then returns to tokyo to discover most of his hometown obliterated by godzilla and his parents have been killed wracked with guilt and ostracised by a community made aware of his gutlessness koichi befriends and provides shelter for a homeless woman noriko oishi minami hamabe and the orphaned baby she cares for time passes and koichi lands a job tracking and deactivating american mines from the sea of japan partly to atone for his past cowardice but noriko doesnt want him to go because of the risk unbeknownst to both that a greater danger awaits theres enough going on in the first thirty minutes of godzilla minus one to fill a featurelength drama the protagonists clashing inner conflicts and personal conundrums are such a powerful driving force the fact that a massive prehistoric reptile is also terrorising the city seems often secondary to the engrossing human drama koichis arc glides alongside godzillas path of wanton destruction until strands collide when plans to thwart the beast are unveiled godzilla wreaks havoc in spectacular fashion and in intricately rendered splendour during jawdropping action sequences roaring rampant and gargantuan with an estimated 15 million budget writerdirector and vfx supervisor takashi yamazaki has lovingly crafted a film which celebrates godzillas origins while transcending and subverting its bmovie trappings and trampling those banal us remakes it looks better on the big screen than most modern blockbusters due to skilful melding of cgi miniatures and classic creature sound design with cues from naoki satos score recalling what we love about ishiro hondas 1954 original some of the action feels inelegantly woven with the slow burning drama and can seem a tad jarring while the acting teeters on histrionic but this is hairsplitting when compared to the multitude of pros which make godzilla minus one the best fantasy action film of the year the 1940s setting also feels surprisingly fresh and iconic partly due to the creatures classic design evoking the suitmationmaninsuit technique but its heart complex drama and characters complement the outstanding effects and action yamazakis film an artful barsetting barriershattering near masterpiece in the guise of a behemoth blockbuster that may even move you to tears
Dec 11 2023,positive, im a godzilla casual an awful lot of movies take up mental real estate in my head and it must be said movies featuring japans large reptilian son arent really among them nothing against the big g the first appearance of the iconic kaiju in 1954 is absolutely a classic 2016s shin godzilla is beloved by me since it merges giant monster action with a clever satire of inefficient bureaucracies as for the rest for the most part my belief was that godzilla movies were disposable fluff in the old days youd stick people in uncomfortable rubber suits have them stumble through a cardboard mockup of tokyo then call it a day later cgi wizards took the place of the suits but the song remained the same big monster unsuspecting urban area cardboard characters and cityscape wash rinse repeat theres more to it than that and theres a reason godzilla has been rampaging through movie screens for nearly seventy years a wide variety of stories can be told featuring him some of which can have an emotional impact that hits with the force of atomic breath dont believe me i direct your attention to godzilla minus one a kaiju movie with equal amounts of heart and spectacle in the closing days of world war ii koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki has decided not to die hes a fighter pilot a skilled one yet hes been assigned kamikaze duty so he lands his plane at an airbase on the remote odo island and tells the men there of mechanical issues they cant find anything wrong with the plane and they suspect koichi is a liar and a coward they have bigger problems overnight it comes ashore the locals speak of it in whispered tones a creature the size of a dinosaur they call it godzilla and when it attacks the men koichi has a chance to kill it he freezes up fails when koichi awakens the next morning he learns that godzilla has disappeared into the sea after slaughtering most of the men the only other survivor is tachibana munetaka aoki who burns with hatred toward koichi two years pass and koichi returns to the ruins of tokyo he learns his parents were killed in a firebombing he has nothing like so many others and shame follows him like a shadow life moves on and so does koichi when he meets noriko oishi minami hamabe a young woman who has vowed to care for a young child sae nagatani the two of them join koichi and over time they build something that looks like a family then america tests an atomic bomb at bikini atoll the bomb works so does the radiation which mutates the formerly dinosaursized godzilla to skyscraper heights the creature destroys a number of battleships as it makes its way to japan its an unstoppable force that must be stopped and it may be the means for koichi to achieve redemption i try to admit when im dumb and try to learn and grow beyond my buffoonery one way ive been dumb is the assumption that a godzilla movie is a showcase for stuff getting wrecked and nothing more its true that godzilla minus one does have some jawdropping moments of mass destruction director takashi yamazaki had a budget of around 14 million to make this film and the end result looks as if it cost ten times that he was quoted as saying the staff and i have worked together to create a setting where godzilla looks as if fear itself is walking toward us and where despair is piled on top of despair thats accurate since this is the first time i can recall godzilla being scary instead of us seeing a giant monster wrestle another giant monster yamazaki shows us a force of nature an earthbound god that exists beyond human concerns  but where my assumptions are elegantly proven wrong is in yamazakis script he does the impossible by writing a godzilla story in which we deeply care about the human characters weve got an effective drama about people rebuilding their lives in postwar japan about the effects of ptsd and survivors guilt on soldiers and civilians wisely time is spent getting to know these people and their lives that means when godzilla stomps ashore it matters what happens to these characters it was so effective that when a major kaiju attack took place i was genuinely worried that koichi and norikos little handmade house would be destroyed consider that if you removed the godzilla parts youd still have a damn fine movie i wouldnt want to be an actor on a project like this it feels tricky since youd need to balance the usuals staring into the sky awestruck running screaming with the creation of a livedin character to be sure there are some stereotypes here the tormented veteran the supportive pseudospouse the scientist with theories nobody believes yet the cast pulls it off with aplomb i liked ryunosuke kamiki very much as the damaged koishi he does a cool thing with his performance where were initially meant to think hell die heroically to make up for his actions on the island then he shows a change in koishi we see him discovering that he has things to live for people to fight for instead of a fiery death in the name of honor its a performance thats both smart and subtle godzilla minus one is one of the strongest blockbusters of 2023 a movie i could see easily smashing its way onto my best of the year list are there other godzilla movies out there as skillful as this one i have no idea but im pleased and kind of stunned that we have this one do yourself a favor and see this on the biggest screen possible
Dec 10 2023,positive, toward the end of world war ii kamikaze pilot kiochi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki lands on odo island for a mechanical problem but only he and mechanic sosoku tachibana munetaka aoki survive an encounter from an ocean god the locals named godzilla a gargantuan lizard bigger than a tyrannosaurus rex that really dislikes being shot at kiochi returns to his devastated home town following the war reminded of his cowardice daily by neighbor sumiko sakura ando with so few people remaining he permits a young woman noriko minami hamabe and an infant to stay with him in whats left of his parents home finding dangerous but lucrative work removing sea mines with other displaced locals kiochi discovers the sea god of odo island has been affected by the atomic testing on bikini atoll appearing larger and more powerful than before occupied wartorn and disarmed japan is already hanging on by a thread but a living disaster is about to strike a nation with no means to defend itself and no one is coming to save it following his japanese introduction in 1954 as the first of over 30 toho films there isnt a film fan alive who doesnt know the name godzilla following a low point in 1998 sorry matthew broderick it wasnt until 2014 that godzilla appeared in the monarch storyline films for legendary that an american production won over fans with their herozilla to commemorate the big guys 70th anniversary toho announced minus one  written and directed by sfx supervisor takeshi yamazaki  recasting godzilla as a force of nature exacerbated by human arrogance the new film not only hammers home that actions have consequences but tells a human story of existence in a wartorn land with an impossible apocalypse marching toward them its a tall order even for the undisputed king of the monsters to unleash something new but with modern moviemaking effects and seven decades of stories in the history books where will minus one rank among all the godzilla movies to date the trailer paints a disturbing and dangerous picture of godzilla but kiochis story is the lens through which viewers experience the rise of the monster questioning duty blind obedience to government politics and what it means to be a patriot the alltoo human arc from reluctant suicide pilot ordered to die into a determined fighter by choice is organic heartbreaking and cheerworthy his fear is as visceral as his regret unable to fight when he was told to but also unable to let it go of his guilt as a survivor while the ladies sadly take a back seat to much of this story in a time and place where men are front and center the actions theyre able to take are salient nonetheless everything else is an unholy marriage between dunkirk and jaws served up with a side of raw courage making for an incredible film in addition to being a great godzilla movie on land this godzilla appears like something from jurassic park by way of cloverfield through a series of upclose pov shots his movement only appears smooth as his temper flairs especially in his irradiated larger form since the water is his natural environment the only chance one has to avoid his piercing gaze is something else unfortunately gaining his attention his atomic breath retains the popular blue energy glow working its way up from tail to mouth adding an extruded dorsal fin plate like chevrons on a stargate as it powers up retracting all at once when unleashed whats different is the effect upon whatever that weapon touches remember the blast from the iron giant when it targeted a ship off the coast and thankfully missed even more incredible is the reported budget for delivering this blockbuster 15 million a tenth of what legendary spent making godzilla vs king kong its long been a discussion among fans  no matter how cheesy the maninsuit effects actually were stomping through model cities in slow motion  what it would be like if toho employed stateoftheart vfx in a new godzilla film that has now been decidedly answered and its everything one could hope for in addition to an apple tv monarch legacy of monsters series legendary has also released a trailer for its next film  godzilla x kong the new empire  but after minus one its far more interesting to wonder what toho will do next with their current success
Dec 9 2023,positive, for nearly 70 years dozens of godzilla movies  the first appeared in 1954  have been audience favorites the world over this one isnt really a monster movie per se its about a group of people and a nation and how they react to this gargantuan presence its no exaggeration to say this is a masterpiece by writerdirector takashi yamazaki the focal character is a kamikaze pilot in the last days of world war ii koichi ryunokuke kamiki who makes a decision not to complete his suicide mission but to pretend his plane is having engine problems he lands on an island in the meantime godzilla returns after the u s military completes a nuclear test on bikini atoll the creature bigger and more dangerous than ever slogs his way to tokyo smashing buildings vehicles and people on his rampage and to tell you more wouldnt be fair the realistic look of the movie  battle scenes godzilla pursuing a boat people fleeing the monster  are riveting to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Dec 8 2023,positive,the first godzilla movie that made me cry but also the first one that made me feel afraid
Dec 8 2023,positive, one of the most infamous creatures in movie history is back in godzilla minus one the 37th film in the franchise that dates back to the 1950s the latest entry may be one of the best yet combining a fantastic mix of chaos and mayhem with some stirring human elements that give it unexpected depth and heart its the film that hollywood has been trying to capture for years and have mostly failed godzilla takes place near the end of world war ii with kamikaze pilot kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki landing on odo island with mechanical issues when the island is attacked by godzilla shikishima freezes up in a critical moment unable to save nearly everyone else on the island from the creatures wrath the guilt from the incident weighs heavily on the pilot who returns to tokyo working as a minesweeper shikishima takes in a young woman named noriko ōishi minami hamabe and an orphaned infant named akiko who ōishi rescued the three form a makeshift family trying to start a new life after the devastation of the war but just as things start to return to normal godzilla returns  a more dangerous version of the creature encountered on odo island with nuclear tests conducted by the united states causing godzilla to mutate into a seemingly indestructible force one of the problems with godzilla films particularly american versions has been the decision to go story heavy with only flashes of the monster sometimes keeping the monster hidden for almost the entire film writerdirector takashi yamazaki never falls for that trap in minus one with the creature as much a part of the story as the human element there are some wonderful scenes of destruction and godzilla doing what fans expect wrecking havoc the sequences are spectacular with wellcrafted special effects that really bring the creature to life just watching godzilla be godzilla is enough to make the film work but what takes this film to another level is the way the audience really feels the aftermath of the devastation  the toll it takes on the human characters especially the two leads its that unexpected human element with some fun welldeveloped supporting characters thrown in that takes this godzilla to another level sure you have seen the monster before but this is godzilla at his very best  a fun action film that also has a compelling story to be more than just chaos 
Dec 8 2023,positive,most impressive is the writing and the emotional depth of the story being told this is one of the great genre movies in recent memory and i hope this team goes on to make more godzilla movies moving forward
Dec 8 2023,positive, if you have any interest at all in giant creatures see this movie on the biggest screen possible if you have any interest at all in the future of humanity see this movie on the biggest screen possible  originally scheduled for just a oneweek engagement in theaters the run has been extended by distributor toho international which gave me an opportunity to sneak out from work and see it although the film is not true imax  see this detailed polygon explainer  i went to cinemark 17 imax which has the biggest screen in dallas and a tremendous sound system especially from my seat in the middle near the top  the experience was toplevel both visually and sonically early reports suggested that it was an emotional experience as well which i scoffed at  until the movie began and displayed the toho label i started crying  as a young boy in the 1960s i often watched our 10 blackandwhite television by myself especially creature features that often popped up on saturday afternoons inevitably that include the likes of king kong 1933 and of course multiple godzilla and other giant monster movies something about the monsters attracted rather than repelled me and i always found myself rooting for their survival was it because we had a family dog who was bigger than me was it because my father and older brother were bigger than me beats me whatever the source of my identification with these unsung heroes i could never imagine seeing any of those movies on a big screen in a proper movie theater seeing the toho opening credit instantly sparked a cascade of memories from watching dozens of toho monster movies  godzilla minus one begins on an island during the dying days of world war ii claiming that his engine is in need of repair kamikaze pilot shikishima ryunosuke kamiki has sought refuge at the military airplane facility located on the island head mechanic tachibana munetaka ando reports that the engine is not in fact in need of repair but acknowledges that the war is indeed lost and that further suicidal actions would be pointless  then the island is attacked by a giant lizard that bites soldiers in half and tosses their bodies hither and thither stomping on more as it comes ashore impervious to the weapons wielded by the soldiers in a panic tachibana urges shikishima to his plane so that he can fire his weapons including bombs at the creature and kill it  shikishima is unable to fire his weapons nearly all the soldiers all die only he and tachibana survive he is haunted and wracked by guilt  written and directed by takashi yamazaki who made his initial mark in the us with returner 2002 the film develops the guiltwracked theme throughout the drama that develops as shikishima ends up caring for noriko minami hamabe and an infant girl who she found orphaned in the wreckage of japan they form a makeshift family struggling to survive another family unit is created when shikishima finds a job which leads him to the sea and an eventual reunion with godzilla  the monster attacks are terrifying in their intensity and brutal in their effect upon society whereas shin godzilla 2016 for example was all about government  bureaucrats and how their endless squabbling impacted the citizens godzilla minus one is all about the citizens and how they are affected by governmental inactions in that sense its an answer film to both shin godzilla and oppenheimer 2023 which both focused on the decisionmakers rather than the victims of those decisions  you may have to be a longtime kaiju follower and fan to appreciate all the creative cinematic choices that are made in godzilla minus one yet you need only be a fan of cinema and a human being to appreciate a movie that values life this film has no internal logic and intentionally avoids the subject it is supposedly addressing it is technically proficient visually but poorly written and edited and unlike the original godzilla substitutes the reality of the horrors of nuclear war with westernstyle blockbuster romance and lastminute rescues copyright 20102024 peter a martin all rights reserved no portions of this material may be used without the express written permission of the copyright holder
Dec 8 2023,positive, who could have predicted that the biggest sleeper surprise in movie theaters in 2023 would be a japanese monster movie godzilla minus one is the creature feature we didnt know we needed this films retro mix of 1950sera storytelling and classic special effects is an exciting throwback with tons of heart heres one that will cause even the most steelyeyed of viewers to wipe away tears as this moving antiwar portrait draws to an emotional close opening at the end of wwii kamikaze pilot kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki fails to carry out his suicide mission feeling disgraced he lands his plane on an island once there the airmen are attacked by a strange dinosaurlike beast and kōichi does nothing to fight back returning to his homeland kōichi discovers that his parents have been killed in bombings his home is a damaged mess and the villagers are scattered and broken he provides shelter for a young woman named noriko minami hamabe who has taken custody of an orphan baby together they care for the infant and begin to rebuild but while kōichi is out collecting exploding and safeguarding mines at sea with a crew the dinosaur returns to attack them but this time the monster godzilla has grown and its thirst for destruction expanded as well by banning together the townspeople hope to prevent godzilla from wreaking havoc on their community and tokyo they will need all the talents squandered and exploited during the war to confront this threat its a just fight that offers kōichi a second chance to regain his honor and save his people its hard to describe the studied effectiveness of this japanese transplant to us theaters its a monster movie at its core but the drama is remarkably wellconceived and executed with the recent release of the latest trailer for 2024s godzilla x kong the new empire and this years apple tv series monarch one hopes that a little of the minus one pathos finds its way to its english language counterparts when dull unknown college professor paul matthews nicolas cage starts popping up in the dreams of random people he becomes an overnight sensation and as his star rises he and his wife janet julianne nicholson grapple with how to deal with such sudden and bizarre fame little do they know that their familys nightmare is about to begin dream scenario starts with a fantastic premise and this i had a dream about you concept is infused with a healthy dose of social media and a pinch of the macabre when paul goes viral his expansion into everyones dreams has a hint of credibility beyond the fantastical the power of suggestion is on full display with his directorial debut writerdirector kristoffer borgli could have embraced the horror of pauls predicament and dove into familiar genre conceits instead he smartly focuses on pauls family struggles turning the film into a bitter domestic satire along the way we get selfaware comedic references such as a sequence where paul does a photo shoot while wearing a bladed freddy kreuger glove concentrating on the more concrete consequences to paul janet and their children helps to ground this otherwise madcap film while giving cage a role to sink his teeth into the always entertaining cage is primarily restrained approaching something like his roles in 2002s adaptation he plays paul as insecure clueless and ultimately very sad and this makes the movies dour resolution a bit of a downer still the challenging journey offers biting delights like a supporting turn by michael cera playing the head of a public relations firm seeking to monetize pauls moment john chau was a young man on a mission with an adventurous spirit and a mighty religious zeal leading him on an expedition in 2018 he left the relative safety of the united states to travel to north sentinel island in india he hoped to share the word of his god with the sentinelese the mission is a finely made documentary about johns life and tragic death we learn about his unique upbringing and his love of the outdoors but we also discover that the intelligent cum laude graduate of oral roberts university was inspired by deepseated evangelical beliefs to take extraordinary risks that ultimately helped to sign his death warrant while johns story should act as an intense cautionary tale about the dangers of evangelical extremism filmmakers amanda mcbaine and jesse moss see the excellent boys state carefully respect his passion interviews with experts examine johns religion without demonizing his faith the film also tells the history of the sentinelese viewers might not know that the government of india protects this tiny tribe that has no contact to speak of with the outside world when people do attempt communication the sentinelese react violently the idea of an isolated community in this day and age is surprising and provocative the mission combines animation interviews archived footage and the rich historical record to introduce the sentinelese from afar and john chau in a sad intimate manner this documentary is one of the years very best nonfiction motion pictures almost 14 years have passed since the last episode of the longrunning monk series in this movie tony shalhoub steps back into the obsessivecompulsive detective role of adrian monk for one last personal case involving monks beloved stepdaughter molly caitlin mcgee as she prepares for her wedding solving the case isnt the reason to watch this one seeing shalhoub and the returning cast members regroup proves to be the films secret sauce and the story has fun with the covid19 pandemic in that monks peculiar obsessiveness comes in handy in the wake of the viral outbreak everyone has a little monk in them the standout here is hector elizondo as monks psychiatrist dr neven bell i suspect that their scenes will soften the hardened hearts of some viewers

Dec 7 2023,positive, culture representation taking place from 1945 to 1947 the scifiaction film godzilla minus one features an allasian cast of characters representing the workingclass and middleclass godzilla minus one is a welcome return to retro godzilla filmmaking that puts more emphasis on character development instead of the overblown visual effects and annoying characters than can be found in hollywood versions of godzilla movies and the movie achieved this excellence with only a reported 15 million production budget which is a small fraction of the budget of a typical hollywood godzilla movie  written and directed by takashi yamazaki godzilla minus one takes place in japan from 1945 to 1947 the movie has subtle and nottosubtle symbolism of the effects that the atomic bomb had on japan the monster godzilla in its original iteration was meant to be a symbol of fear of the type of massive destruction that can come from an atomic bomb or other type of nuclear bomb godzilla minus one doesnt tease viewers or play coy in showing the monster since godzilla appears and kills people in the very first scene of the movie within five minutes of the movie starting godzilla minus one begins in 1945 toward the end of world war ii at the odo island airfield before godzilla appears a young fighter pilot named kōichi shikishima played by ryunosuke kamiki first notices that something is very wrong because theres a lot of dead fish in the ocean everyone at the airfield dies because of godzillas attack except kōichi and a navy air service technician named sōsaku tachibana played by munetaka aoki who blames kōichi  for the massacre because kōichi froze and didnt shoot at godzilla from his plane when he had the chance sōsaku thinks that kōichi could have used his pilot skills to fight godzilla but its somewhat unfair blame because kōichi had been knocked unconscious during the attack still kōichi feel guilty for all of the deaths and has posttraumatic stress disorder after returning home to tokyo kōichi who has no siblings finds out that his parents died in an air raid bombing that killed thousands of people a neighbor named sumiko ōta played by sakura ando tells him the tragic news in her grief sumiko verbally lashes out at kōichi who was a kamikaze pilot by scolding him for being a disgrace to japan sumiko says that if he had done his kamikaze pilot job properly he would have died for his country kōichi has a secret that he tells to only a few people when he was a kamikaze fighter pilot and he knew that japan was coming close to being defeated in world war ii he pretended that there was a malfunction in his plane in order to temporarily get out of fighting in the war he was at odo island airfield to get his malfunctioning plane fixed when godzilla attacked the war ended shortly after this attack there is chaos in the streets of tokyo where one day kōichi sees a woman whos about the same age as he is midtolate 20s frantically running away from some men who are calling her a thief shes carrying a baby whom she quickly hands to kōichi before running away a shocked kōichi spends quite some time looking for the woman who comes out of hiding in a nearby alley when she sees that he is alone  the woman says her name is noriko ōishi played by minami hamabe and the baby is a girl named akiko noriko explains that akiko is not her biological child the baby was given to akiko during an air raid attack by a dying female stranger whom noriko assumes is akikos mother  noriko doesnt know the womans name and has decided to take care of akiko noriko also says that her own parents were killed in the air raid bombings and she has nowhere to live kōichi is a kind person and invites noriko and akiko to live with him noriko has an outspoken and independent streak by march 1946 the relationship between kōichi and noriko has blossomed into romantic love but they are reluctant to express their true feelings to each other they have settled into a happy domestic life as an unmarried platonic couple and are raising akiko played by sae nagatani together their living arrangement is unusual but not unexpected in an area devastated by war and where many people have formed familial bonds with people who arent biologically related to them after their own biological family members died in the war kōichi works as a minesweeper while noriko has an office job noriko is worried about the dangerous nature of kōichis job but he assures her that he probably wont get killed from being a minesweeper their neighbor sumiko who is no longer angry at kōichi sometimes helps take care of akiko kōichi is kind to akiko but when she becomes old enough to speak he doesnt want her to call him daddy or father he repeatedly tells akiko that hes not her father and she looks sad every time he says that because kōichi is the only father she has ever known in his minesweeper job kōichi works with three other men on a ramshackle wooden boat called shinsei maru the three other men are a former navy engineer named kenji noda played by hidetaka yoshioka who is logical and eventempered boat captain yōji akitsu played by kuranosuke sasaki who is commanding and has a somewhat stubborn personality and junior crew member shirō mizushima played by yuki yamada who has an eagertolearn personality and wants the respect of his more experienced colleagues  since this is a godzilla movie its only a matter of time before godzilla makes another appearance to attack without going into too many details its enough to say that by 1947 kōichi finds himself in the pacific ocean fighting godzilla with his colleagues as already shown in the movies trailer kenji has come up with a plan to destroy godzilla  but will this plan work a former navy air service technician named sōsaku tachibana played by munetaka aoki has a pivotal role in the fighter planes that are used in the intense battles against godzilla it should come as no surprise that kōichi would eventually use his fighter pilot skills instead of being stuck on a boat firing cannons the action in the movie is easy to predict but still thrilling to watch godzilla minus one also makes the most of its relatively small budget with convincing visual effects and sound design in addition to writing and directing godzilla minus one yamazaki coled the movies visual effects department with kiyoko shibuya this is a godzilla movie where viewers can feel as terrified as the characters in the movie the pacing and editing of the movie in the battle scenes also add to the suspense visual effects and action scenes are empty without engaging characters no one is going to win any major awards for acting in godzilla minus one but the movie does a very good job at showing the emotional stakes that the principal characters have in the story like many of the characters in the movie kōichi and noriko lost their families to a massacre kōichi and noriko have created a unique family of their own that viewers will be rooting for to survive and stay together godzilla is the namesake and star attraction for this franchise but the best godzilla movies are the one that have human characters whom viewers care about the most godzilla minus one minus color is the same movie as godzilla minus one but in black and white instead of color on the plus side the blackandwhite imagery makes the movie look more like the 1940s time period in which the story takes place however iconic hue images such as godzillas glowing blue spine arent there the heart of the story remains which is why its still an impressive monster movie but the color version is a more immersive experience that makes godzilla slightly more terrifying seeing the movie in black and white makes it look like a time capsule almost like a documentary the psychological effect on viewers is that godzilla looks like a monster stuck in a past century seeing the movie in color makes it look more convincing that godzilla is a monster that could live for centuries and could be part of the present day and thats why the ending is more effective when seeing the movie is color toho international released godzilla minus one in us cinemas on december 1 2023 with a sneak preview on november 29 2023 the movie was released in japan on october 18 2023 a blackandwhite version of godzilla minus one titled godzilla minus one minus color will be released in japan on january 12 2024 and in the us on january 26 2024
Dec 7 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies of the year  hands down without a doubt
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a celebration of godzillas legacy and shows audiences why this monster has endured for 70 years
Dec 7 2023,positive,i had my doubts about this movie being anything more than the usual godzilla remake despite the glowing reviews but this really is a fine movie in its own right thanks to a solid script good special effects and most of all fine acting performances
Dec 7 2023,positive, who else this new kaiju flick from godzillas home studio toho celebrates the title characters 70th anniversary released in the us with minimal fanfare no screening for critics in my area this entry tells a standalone story unrelated to the earlier japanese or american films and it feels very different from either series for one thing its a period piece it begins in 1945 with shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a young kamikaze first shirking his suicide mission then freezing up when hes confronted with the supposedly legendary sea monster at a small airbase in the odo islands this lapse results in horrifying losses then when shikishima gets back to the ruins of postwar tokyo hes a pariah in his neighborhood over the next couple of years the guilthaunted shikishima becomes the reluctant head of an improvised family after noriko minami hamake a young homeless woman takes shelter in his house with an orphaned baby shes picked up to support them he takes a job with an oddball minesweeping crew on a small boat clearing the leftover mines surrounding japan then one day the big g surfaces made gargantuan after being irradiated during the bikini nuclear tests and heads for tokyo the monster scenes here are spectacular staged by writerdirector takashi yamazaki with panache and a feel for dizzying ponderousness there are some genuine jolts too notably godzillas first appearance best of all the behemoths big scenes employ akira ifukubes masterly score from the original 1954 film but at some level godzilla minus one feels less about monster action and more about japanese society struggling to come to terms with an almost unimaginable defeat the big scaly guy seems more like a symbol of the magnitude of despondency that had to be overcome for the country to survive and rebuild this along with heartfelt acting from an appealing cast and an effective sense of period detail makes the film unexpectedly moving having a failed kamikaze as the hero set the story up for an obvious payoff that i found troubling from the first scenes of the film the perceived need for redemption from the eminently sensible decision not to carry out the lunacy of a futile suicide mission here i thought is the sort of intractable nationalism that makes for good melodrama but in real life leads countries into war and horror and misery im happy to say that g1 is having none of it while giving full credit to worthwhile selfsacrifice the film is resolutely life affirming this country never changes one of the characters mutters about some governmental folly maybe it cant but that country did change albeit at a godzillasized price and this movie gets at the pained yet exhilarating spirit of that change my kid accompanied me to this film and after checking out the trailer on the way to the theater she disapprovingly said i think theyre going to hurt him him being godzilla she was right the monster is not here a longsuffering defender of humankind against some bizarre alien or primal abomination but a rampaging destructive force who must be stopped even his roar sounds scarier its not the usual nasal irritable honk but even so i too felt sympathy for him during the efforts to destroy him something about that big lizard is lovable even when hes being a bad boy
Dec 7 2023,positive, post war japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb far more than just a simple monster movie takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one is a moving examination of a nation dealing with societal trauma the japanese populace attempting to recover from massive damage inflicted on their land as well as their national psyche taking place just after world war ii and before ishiro hondas 1954 original the story is a bracing examination of japan during the postwar era a once proud country reduced to rubble its citizens devastated body and soul forced to come to terms with their tattered heritage and uncertain future kochi ryunosuke kamiki is just one of millions uncertain about what each day may bring that he carries an inescapable stigma only makes matters worse a kamikaze who refused to make the ultimate sacrifice he returns home in shame only to find his house destroyed his family gone despondent and uncertain his path crosses that of noriko minami hamabe a young woman who has also lost everything yet has taken in an orphaned child to care for these three form a makeshift family struggling to cobble together some sort of daytoday existence fate shines on kochi when he gets a highpaying government job gathering and disabling the thousands of ocean mines left behind by allied forces its dangerous work but the salary comes in handy while his coworkers akitsu kuranosuke saski noda hidetaka yoshioka become trusted friends the crew settle into a routine but its violently disrupted by the united states nuclear bomb tests being conducted on nearby bikini atoll they have not only awakened a dinosaurlike animal the natives refer to as godzilla but have transformed it into an unstoppable atomicfueled creature that is the personification of the nations fear while the seminal creature is the selling point the focus of the film is the impact ww ii had on the japanese culture godzilla is a metaphor for the trauma japan has faced a shambling firebreathing sixstory symbol of the ptsd each of the survivors must contend with not only does he represent the past but the future as well the monster a threat that must be faced and contained if this society is to survive his attacks in ginza and tokyo are tests the suffering of the country made real denial regarding their place in the world their responsibility for their plight and the uncertainty of tomorrow are all addressed when the populace  with no help from the government  make their final stand yamazaki focuses on the human drama more than the kaiju shenanigans  its a risky approach thats gone wrong in less talented hands yet his script is grounded by characters we come to care for made sympathetic by the fine work of the cast their efforts provide an emotional foundation for the film that not only elicits our sympathy but gives weight to the scenes of destruction and those moments are not only spectacular but terrifying yamazaki effectively combines practical and digital effects to create one nightmare scenario after another the creature effortlessly cutting a swath through the cities mass destruction and misery in his wake theres a fluidity to godzillas movements that lend him credibility while the directors camera placement  often from ground level effectively drives home how terrifying being in the presence of a creature would be theres an urgency to these scenes thats absent in the other godzilla films the filmmaker putting the viewer in the monsters path within his zone of destruction again and again whereas most of the franchise entries focus on the massive property damage done zero underscores the nuclear threat the monster represents when using his atomic breath the damage caused is reminiscent of the pictures taken of the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki a shot of a mushroom cloud rising in the distance as the monster witnesses his handiwork is genuinely chilling this genre entry driving home the dire nature of the nuclear threat far more effectively than oppenheimer in the end this is a tale of redemption and as such the improbable ending is in keeping with kochi and his brethrens journey timely exciting and cathartic godzilla minus zero proves to be one of the biggest cinematic surprises of 2023 a movie that not only revitalizes the japanese franchise but also serves as yet another bracing reminder of mans atomic folly and the inescapable threat it continues to pose
Dec 6 2023,positive, i only heard about the movie a few days ago and i cover movies and tv shows for a living i was confused at first usually theres a big marketing push for the next starstudded ultimately mediocre monster movie but this one was boasting a 97 fresh on rotten tomatoes and id never even seen a trailer or movie poster this is primarily because this is not a monsterverse movie its a shockingly lowbudget japanese film thats easily the best godzilla movie ive ever seen whether its the best godzilla movie ever made is a bit more subjective but as far as im concerned it blows everything else out of the watersomething our heroes have a very hard time doing to the titular monster 2021s godzilla vs kong cost somewhere between 155 and 200 million to make the upcoming godzilla vs kong the new empire will cost over 200 million godzilla minus one had a budget of 15 million usd and im still not sure how they pulled it off the cgi is terrific and the titular monster is terrifying and monstrous nothing about this film feels lowbudget that goes especially for the script which adds a badly needed human element to the story this is in many respects a wwii character drama it takes place in the final days of the war in the pacific and in the following years as japan rebuilds from the atomic bombs as i sat in the theater i thought about how godzilla is a symbol of japanese national trauma over the atomic bomb since 1954 godzilla has represented the horror and destruction that the japanese people suffered during and in the wake of the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki the film as a period piece delved into the horrors of war the hope that reconstruction kindled the frustration the japanese people felt with their government and new american allies and gave us a glimpse into the postwar days and the ways fear and anxiety fill in every crack the main character koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki was a pilotturnedkamikaze pilot who abandoned his duty at the end of the war and then soon after encountered godzilla on a japanese outpost island his guilt and ptsd drag him into a cycle of misery and selfishness after the war preventing him from connecting to his new family comprised of noriko oishi minami hamabe a young woman he meets in the rubble and little akiko sae nagatani an infant noriko is raising when he takes a job as a minehunter scouring the sea for japanese and american mines he makes shikishima makes new friends but keeps everyone around him at arms length for our young hero the war never ended he lives with his shame but its no kind of life these relationships are what drives godzilla minus one and while the godzilla stuff is exciting and terrifyingand our heroes plan to defeat the monster rather scrappy and creativeits the script that elevates this film above all the recent attempts to bring godzilla to the big screen it turns out that a wellwritten script with complex characters you actually care about and a 15 million budget is a whole lot more effective than a 200 million movie with bad writing and generic onedimensional characters you forget about the moment you leave the theater another lesson you dont need bigname movie stars who cost tens of millions if you have a compelling story there are lots of great actors out there maybe its time to end our obsession with big stars and overcooked cgi hey it worked with star wars us studios should pay close attention in an era of everexpanding budgets and constant failures at the box office punctuated by constant losses in the streaming market it never hurts to save 185 million from time to time
Dec 6 2023,positive,will godzilla ever go out of style if his appearance in the stunning blockbuster level godzilla minus one is any indication i sure hope not 
Dec 6 2023,positive, godzilla minus one is the series first period piece set in the days just after the end of wwii the film centers around kōichi ryunosuke kamiki a failed kamikaze pilot whose brief encounter with a dinosaurlike monster on a remote island in the pacific in the waning days of the war saddles him with a lifetime of guilt as he attempts to rebuild his life in the ashes of tokyo after the war he finds himself the guardian of an unusual family  a woman named noriko minami hamabe and baby akiko sae nagatani an orphan she rescued from the streets when godzilla returns to japan newly irradiated and more dangerous than ever before kōichi sees it as a chance to redeem himself and ensure a better future for his newfound family this time around the kaiju action takes a back seat to the family drama at the films center kōichis survivors guilt makes for potent drama and its his relationship with his family and his determination to right the wrongs of the past that make the film so compelling godzilla is essentially simply the catalyst for kōichis redemption story its also about a nation trying and often failing to rebuild in the face of unprecedented destruction left to its own devices by a united states preoccupied with its conflict with the soviet union japan is struggling to piece itself back together and the new threat posed by godzilla is left to citizens to solve where their government and the world superpowers have failed to act its a surprisingly moving story a tale of a war survivor struggling to overcome his deepseated guilt and embrace the newfound love that has found him seemingly out of nowhere in that regard godzilla represents kōichis personal demons as much as he does the terror of nuclear destruction  giving the protagonist a deeply intimate challenge to overcome in order to feel truly whole again its not about saving japan as much as it is saving his family and wrestling with the ghosts of his past in order to be the person they need him to be that personal aspect makes godzilla minus one a disarmingly heart wrenching epic a grand scale adventure with an unexpected heart that puts its american counterparts to shame this is blockbuster filmmaking at its best  a visually striking and thrilling spectacle that never loses sight of the human story that makes its conflict so compelling its a film with real stakes earned emotional beats and a true sense of the gravity of godzillas destructive powers not only is it arguably the best godzilla film since the 1954 original its one of the great blockbusters of the modern era
Dec 6 2023,positive, godzilla turns 70 next year and to celebrate his parent company toho studios waited until the end of this year to release the most conventional godzilla movie in recent memory godzilla minus one may also be the most sobering and least flamboyant japaneseproduced godzilla movie since the original 1954 nuclear lizard disaster pic though godzilla 1985 fans might disagree some reviews of godzilla minus one have already praised the movie as an escapist crowdpleaser its easy to see why given the bleak but wellcalibrated tone of its humancentric scenes yamazaki gives gfans plenty of reasons to see godzilla minus one in theaters hes got a clear eye for action and a firm grasp on feelgood saberrattling melodrama yamazakis style like his movies politics only looks conservative compared to his predecessors he made a good godzilla movie if not a great one  simon abrams is a native new yorker and freelance film critic whose work has been featured in the new york times vanity fair the village voice and elsewhere
Dec 6 2023,positive, there are a lot of movies out right now in the ether that you can choose from but sometimes its just so hard to pick which ones are worth your time luckily weve watched a lot of movies lately and have picked out five films that you can check out right now that are absolutely worth spending time with as temperatures get colder and being indoors to watch a movie sounds more and more appealing for a night out or in this one is a breathtaking blockbuster filmmaking chocked full of tragedy terror and awe the godzilla movie has kind of become a campy brouhaha veering away of the majesty of gareth edwards film and the sociopolitical ramifications of the 1950s original this one combines those two films with the most compelling human story weve gotten in a monster movie in some time and takashi yamazaki pulls from hayao miyazaki steven spielberg george lucas and christopher nolan to craft a gutpunch spectacle that tears at your heart and blows your mind its the best companion to oppenheimer well get anytime soon as godzilla returns to his metaphorical horror as an allegory for the bomb its hard in this day and age to really wow with blockbuster entertainment these days given how metafocused corporate and passionless our tentpole films have become this is a jolt in the spine the kind of cerebral crowdpleaser with real stakes and some big action sequences that bring in the goosebumps i dont say this lightly this is the best monster movie since cloverfield and one of the best blockbusters of the century just blown away by what is accomplished here this is probably the closest david fincher will ever get to making one of those fabelmanesque autobiographies as he picks at the brilliant procedure thats marked his filmography is the filmmaker in his bag here hammering out baseballs during a home run derby sure although thats kind of why its so intriguing as fincher studies why people like him are so mercilessly dedicated to their own craft this is about the lunacy of compulsion and the crushing expectation of perfection in filmmaking as much as it zaps the rigor out of the killers mythos michael fassbender is so perfectly attuned with what fincher wants to do here down to the droll confidence of the selfserious narration to the robotic mechanisms of his work theres a deep desire here to splash a cold bucket of water on creative arrogance the brash instinct we all have that we hung the moon and stars and could never ever fudge up something so routine well fincher seems to be telling on himself a bit humbling himself to the process and the inescapable margin for error that plagues the species however hes also having much more fun with that notion than he ever has in his career as hes embracing the weirdo side that eats just the insides the mcdonalds breakfast sandwich listens to the same band over and over again to get into the rhythm and well does 70plus versions of the same take because its got to be a perfect shot even if you know youre going to miss every now and again no matter how hard you try the sheer thrill of seeing both the chicken run chickens and kenan  kel back in action after all these years  aw hell im an easy mark really though aardman just knocked this one out of the henhouse sure it moves a little fast but its the perfect sequel to a movie that really didnt need a sequel if that makes sense it expands on the ideas and emotional developments of the first film while throwing in some fun wrinkles and ratcheting up the dark underbelly of mrs tweedys plots the action just stuns like it did in the first film as aardman remains one of the few collectives who can stage this kind of moving sequence packed with so many clever jokes and such ingenious ways of getting from a to b no wonder steven spielberg wanted them at dreamworks way back when i was around seven when the first movie came out and it really did a number on me im 31 with this one and im very pleased at how this one really did just throw me right back into it all this is the toy story 2 to chicken runs toy story down to the very clear delightful homages to toy story 2 that make that parallel for you i loved this one babs forever on one hand the toy story of stopmotion animation its an absolute masterpiece on the other hand how did the tweedys not notice the chickens were wearing clothes and jewelry im not sure this style of documentary would work for everyone but it sure as heck works for albert brooks i couldve watched this for 5 hours john kramer antihero is so so much more interesting than anything this franchise has done in eons tobin bell is spectacular here and there are genuine stakes in the saw world where billy the puppet is far far less intimidating than the dastardly corporate swindlers who prey on the weak this is the kind of reset the saw films needed as watching people get stuck in a jigsaw trap becomes much easier to stomach if you could argue that theyre the ones who put themselves there in the first place this is easily the best saw film since the original i got a little emotional there at the end during a fiercely unexpected moment where kramer is squarely a moral center and thats not something i had on my cinematic bingo card this year
Dec 5 2023,positive, as a devoted godzilla fan and an avid enthusiast of monster flicks my anticipation for godzilla minus one was already skyhigh the overwhelmingly positive reactions only added to my expectations setting the stage for what i hoped would be a potential contender for my top 10 of the year legendarys monsterverse has been a mixed bag with some entries earning praise while others left fans yearning for more but so far not a single installment has been able to blow me away trusting the creative vision of writerdirector takashi yamazaki the eternal zero i entered the theater with optimism ready to be enthralled by a narrative that went beyond epic monster battles at its core godzilla minus one isnt merely a monster movie its a postwar tale of one mans quest for forgiveness purpose and inner peace kōichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki is a complex protagonist haunted by the traumatic events of the first godzilla attack who grapples not only with the burden of guilt from abandoning his duty as a kamikaze pilot but also with his inability to save others during the godzilla onslaught yamazaki crafts an intimate narrative that delves into the protagonists internal struggles revealing a man driven not by cowardice as everyone around him believes but by a profound desire to preserve life and prevent further bloodshed this theme adds a layer of complexity to a film that transcends the typical monster movie narrative and explores the psychological aftermath of war godzilla minus one also tackles broader topics of humanity illustrating how people unite in the face of dire situations unlike hollywood norms which often force romantic relationships through quick montages yamazaki takes a less romanticized approach the filmmaker focuses on advancing the plot and character relationships organically using time jumps only to signify progression without compromising authenticity this departure from formulaic storytelling is a testament to the films commitment to its narrative integrity one of the movies standout technical elements is its score naoki satō a truly epic cathartic composition that elevates every action set piece but also the more personal familyfocused moments the powerful godzilla theme resonates through the theater keeping audiences on the edge of their seats yet the music also exhibits subtlety with piano notes carrying the emotional weight of poignant scenes its a delicate balance that enriches the overall experience emphasizing the visceral impact of the often dark story the sound design particularly in the atomic breath scenes is nothing short of powerful the painstakingly crafted audio enhances godzillas destructive power by encompassing the mayhem of the monsters unleashed might in pure silence before a brutal explosion literally blows everyone away godzilla minus one holds one of the most impressive atomic breath sequences ive ever seen from both an audiovisual standpoint and a character perspective for the viewers who think of godzilla 2014 as a film that toned down the presence of the actual monster too much yamazaki hits that perfect balance between story characters and monster entertainment a real sensory feast visually godzilla minus one is a triumph kōzō shibasakis cinematography is stunning and just like the rest of the movies attributes terrifically wellbalanced not only does it capture the gargantuan scale of the monster and the devastation it leaves in its wake but the dedication and care put into these massive sequences equally reach every frame revolving around the more personal character side which occupies most of the runtime the attention to detail extends to godzillas design which is totally badass its skin regeneration scenes as well as how its body reacts to sudden water pressure changes are surprising elements that lead to a banger of a third act  pacing is beautifully handled throughout the entire runtime one minor critique lies in the brief closeups of its face where weirdly it appears to be smiling like a human being while this doesnt significantly impact any set piece it serves as a minor distraction in otherwise gorgeous vfx work in addition to this while the writing is sharp and engaging the lead acting occasionally veers into melodramatic territory the emotions are present but the overthetop delivery at times detracts from the authenticity of the characters experiences this becomes particularly noticeable in scenes addressing ptsd where the performances sometimes become overwhelming affecting the seriousness of the subject matter godzilla minus one strikes an outstanding balance between compelling character building a thematically rich narrative and two hours of gargantuan entertainment ultimately becoming a noteworthy addition to the monster film subgenre it breaks the formulaic barriers of generic creature flicks by delivering a layered story that explores themes of redemption forgiveness and the aftermath of war the memorable score powerful sound design and exquisite visuals contribute to a cinematic experience that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant while the lead acting occasionally falters into melodrama it does little to diminish the overall impact of a movie that has undoubtedly earned its place among the toptier entries in the godzilla franchise portuguese critic with a tremendous passion for cinema television and the art of filmmaking an unbiased perspective from someone who has stopped watching trailers since 2017 
Dec 5 2023,positive,this thunderous film works on both massive and small scales packing the screen with action mass destruction heroics sudsy melodrama and terrific effects 
Dec 5 2023,positive,director takashi yamazaki has crafted a perfect combination of pathos and excitement paying homage to the original 1954 film while bringing it into the modern age
Dec 5 2023,positive, the 37th film in the japanese blockbuster franchise and the 33rd produced by toho studios godzilla minus one turns the clock back to the late 1940s as it dramatises a destructive attack from the king of the monsters on a country still reeling in the aftermath of world war ii written and directed by takashi yamazaki who also oversees the films copious visual effects godzilla minus one is as much a lavish period drama about a country rediscovering a sense of national worth as it is an epic kaiju monster spectacle disgraced kamikaze pilot koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki has been living in shame ever since he refused to sacrifice himself and die the honourable death that his military rank dictated he shares his modest home with noriko minami hamabe a young woman he saves from the authorities together with a newborn baby she pulled from the debris of their bombedout neighbourhood but koichis selfloathing prevents him from marrying her he is granted an opportunity to redeem himself however after landing a job on a minesweeper shortly after the end of the war it is dangerous work but pays well and soon leads him into direct contact with the marauding sea monster in a sequence that owes a sizeable debt to steven spielbergs jaws koichi and the rest of the motley crew attempt to see off the beast using mines recovered from the ocean but their efforts do little more than anger godzilla who heads for shore and the streets of tokyo as with many recent entries in this recordbreaking franchise godzilla minus one is not a sequel nor as its title might suggest a prequel but the latest chapter in a series that thrives on continuous reinvention the towering lizard treads an uncannily familiar path of destruction through the bustling shopping district and across busy train lines as composer naoki sato reintroduces akira ifukubes iconic score to winning effect also significant is 2001s godzilla mothra and king ghidorah giant monsters allout attack in which godzilla is propelled by the ghosts of japans war dead searching for revenge the film has received criticism in some quarters for pushing a promilitary agenda but the protagonists of godzilla minus one are united in vehement criticism of their government which pressured so many ordinary citizens into wasting their lives for a questionable cause in their stand against godzilla conversely they mobilise voluntarily against a single recognisable threat and in doing so deliver some of the most spectacular showdowns in the franchises 70year history
Dec 4 2023,positive, godzilla will not die bullets plink off of it like raindrops plant a mine in its mouth detonate it with a machine gun and sure youll blow half of its face off but it will simply regenerate a new one a few moments later our desire to destroy it only seems to make it stronger godzilla minus one 12 354 stars directed by takashi yamazaki written by takashi yamazaki starring ryunosuke kamiki minami hamabe yuki yamada munetaka aoki hidetaka yoshioka sakura ando running time 125 mins so too godzilla the series of films featuring the scaly mountainsized monster born from the atomic devastation of world war ii has reached its 70th anniversary it has survived technological advances that have gone well beyond a guy in a giant lizard suit ironyarmed jokesters who have spent decades lobbing cracks at godzilla and its kaiju cousins and even the cgilarded american iterations that have all but drained the joy out of the concept with blunt unnuanced spectacle  hell during its opening weekend the latest and most buzzedabout iteration of the franchise in a generation godzilla minus one went toe to toe with the queen bey herself coming in an impressive third in the box office behind beyoncés renaissance and the latest hunger games movie godzilla minus ones threeday gross of 11 million even set a us record for a foreign language film one of the simplest ways to explain its unbreakable resilience over the decade is that the creature has maintained its status as cinemas largest and greatest metaphorrivaled only by the great and powerful oz and pay no attention to the man behind the curtain that is certainly the case in the monsters latest iteration written and directed by takashi yamazaki a seasoned special effects supervisor helming his 20th feature film the movie also serves as a powerful fable about the nature of regret and the manner in which survivors guilt metastasizes over time shikishima who lost his parents in the bombing of tokyo and carries the family photos of the men killed at odo like a crown of thorns doesnt marry and start a family in the manner of his postwar compatriots instead he runs into noriko japanese superstar minami hamabe while she is caring for a baby she herself found abandoned like the clothes they wear and the ramshackle leanto in which they initially live in a decimated city their lives are patched together with shards and detritus of loss  yamazakis approach to bringing the giant to lifewhile done with cgi like the other godzilla movies of the current generationfeels similarly piecemeal and handmade it may not be a guy in a suit but this lumpy godzilla looks pleasingly terrestrial like a toy played with too hard and left out in the rain even the strange spikes that protrude from its back it must use these to navigate as they seem useless as a weapon have an organic quality resembling the ice jutting out from an old freezer in need of a defrost  as a result of the quaintness of godzillas old wrestlers gait and the fingersmudged quality of his presentation when yamazaki unleashes his monsters heatray breath on the newly rebuilt tokyo the impact feels all that much more impactfulits like a van halen guitar solo in the middle of a recorder recital  coming some five months after this summers doublebarreled glee of barbie and oppenheimer godzilla minus one also serves as another postpandemic reminder of not just how much fun it can be to see big movies in big theaters but how essential these experiences can be in helping us making sense of our own world itself constantly in the churn of unimaginable destruction the film provides an all too necessary escape from for example the horrors of the ongoing tragedy in gaza but as you ruminate on it later it provides another way to consider why we feel the overwhelming need to inflict so much misery on one another movies and the moviegoing experience are like shikishima who over the course of time has come to see noriko not as a charity case but the central love and focus of his life when he meets her randomly on a tokyo thoroughfare that is about to meet the full force of godzillas wrath he pulls her aside we get it you like to have control of your own internet experience but advertising revenue helps support our journalism to read our full stories please turn off your ad blockerwed really appreciate it
Dec 4 2023,positive, i theres a golden age of godzilla its hard to argue that were not in it right now lets face the king of all kaiju is hotter than atomic breath right now and on all fronts usually the toho oftrebooted franchise is clicking while here in america were getting crappy occasionallyembarrassing versions that do godzilla no justice but right now with legendarys monsterverse running wild toho has gone back to its roots and achieved the true pinnacle of godzilla glory with godzilla minus one a stunning achievement that manages to surpass even 2016s revitalizing shin godzilla in a way godzilla minus one springboards from what gareth edwards attempted with his 2014 movie which i found to be pretty dull but he attempted to do something by making the humans more than just puny insects waiting to get stomped he tried to give us real stakes so we could invest in the human cost of battling the kaiju but with godzilla minus one the formula is just right calculating postwwii trauma and atomic age anxiety along with a healthy dose of survivors guilt godzilla isnt the central character by any means he is a force of nature an unstoppable irresistible presence wearing down a nation that has just lost a war one in which its government literally told its soldiers to sacrifice their lives to a hopeless cause with heavy restrictions placed on japan after the fighting any attempt at rebuilding would take multiple generations to complete those who would start it would never reap the fruits of their labor certainly nobody had the will to fight another war and that goes double for kamikaze pilot koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki in short koichi is a coward he definitely sees himself as one but so too the people forced to endure the humiliation of defeat in war we meet koichi as hes faking a malfunction in his plane so as not to fulfil his kamikaze duties he lands on odo island where godzilla emerges and attacks the military mechanics koichi as the only gunner has a chance to take out godzilla but is too scared to shoot as a result the other men all die and koichi is left to carry the burden of his cowardice selfsacrifice is a big theme in godzilla minus one a dismissive government casts a noble spin on selfsacrifice as its soldiers hurl themselves into certain doom but real sacrifice comes from the living who give of themselves to help others live to rebuild to love to find new purpose koichi cant get over the sins of his past but nevertheless takes in a wandering stranger noriko oishi minami hamabe and the orphaned daughter akiko sae nagatani that she cares for along with exmilitary men kenji noda hidetaka yoshioka and sosaku tachibana munetaka aoki koichi finds renewed reasons to live and a use for his gunnery skills as a destroyer of leftover mines its risky work but one hes willing to do in order to care for noriko and akiko but also possibly because he hopes one day itll go wrong and his suffering will be ended in an unexpected explosion koichi is constantly being pulled in different directions with one foot in the living and one in the dead when godzilla threatens to destroy all of ginza putting the people hes unexpectedly grown to love at risk koichi begins to muster up the courage to fight for them no matter the cost so yeah godzilla minus one is basically a postwar melodrama with a dash of godzilla usually the mix is the other way around godzilla dominates the screen and we endure the puny little humans scattering around at his feet but here godzilla is truly terrifying theres no attempt to humanize the creature when he arrives people die and towns are destroyed godzilla could be any force of mother nature a monsoon a hurricane a tornado an earthquake a meteor making landfall he is something to be survived and the power at godzillas disposal is beyond human measure because the scaly beast seems so indestructible it makes the efforts of koichi and his colleagues all exsoldiers with backgrounds in tragedy or citizens worn down by war even more engaging as koichi tries to learn to live again its like hes pulling japan out of its collective despair into a future where they can find reason to hope director takashi yamazaki treats godzilla with all of the reverence he deserves after 70 years weve grown accustomed to its roar to the glowing buildup to his unstoppable atomic breath weve seen it all before tweaked in a thousand different ways to try to add something cool these aspects are truly crowd pleasers and yamakazi uses them sparingly for maximum effect the first time godzilla unleashes his atomic blast you might catch yourself holding your own breath as i did anticipating its destructive impact i dont consider myself a godzilla aficionado ive seen my share of the classic movies and all of the most recent ones both from japanese and american studios none of them have ever had the emotional impact on me that godzilla minus one had there were tears shed in the theater i was at as people connected with koichis story and his seemingly impossible showdown with godzilla as we all know nothing can ever truly keep this kaiju down but godzilla minus one has set a towering bar to surpass its not just a great godzilla movie it might just be the best one yet
Dec 4 2023,negative, despite the decimal of godzilla minus ones japenese title written as 01 echoing hideaki annos rebuild of evangelion series tōhōs iconic series has taken a firm step away from the auteur focus that anno himself brought to 2016s shin godzilla and returned to the journeymen who made the series what it is to call director takashi yamazaki as much a special effects guy as a director would undersell the success hes had helming 3d hit animated movies in the dragon quest lupin iii and doraemon series and he directed a godzilla theme park ride film but minus one set immediately after world war ii lacks the junky fun of jun fukuda or later ishiro honda films and in fact it bears the stink of seriousness its the most white elephant film in the series  the white zilla if you want a pithy pull quote godzilla himheritself looks as epic and masculine and boring as they ever have this writer for one misses the cat eyes but of course you have to take the film on its own terms and the visual effects look undeniably incredible with more direct interaction between the groundlevel human characters and the creature itself than weve ever seen before many have wondered how this was achieved on a slim 15 million budget which is something theres no clear answer to if japans 2d animation industry is anything to go by its tough to imagine wonderful labor practices had much to do with it though thats mere speculation it also helps that godzilla doesnt actually appear all that much more here than they do in one of the cheapo movies but the balance feels more natural because the human narrative is engaging and wellpaced  at least insofar as it never slows down enough to get boring which was always one of the virtues of the spacious and silly journeymen classics the script darts from one halfcontained section to the next theres a whole jaws riff set on a rickety old boat where abandoned mines instead of barrels help to locate the underwater beast and its a strong enough stretch to sustain a whole movie it only lasts about 20 minutes in another section koichi ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot who faked his planes malfunction to go on living and noriko minami hamabe a woman who scorns that very survival end up raising a child whose parents were lost in one of the allied forces countless civilian bombing campaigns and like in ozus record of a tenement gentleman the bitter pain and resentment of immediate postwar living slowly builds into love and the reconstruction of the traditional family this is the emotional center that connects these oftenthrilling tangents and even then this only lasts 30 minutes before a montage ties it up in a bow the oncefiery noriko is quickly softened pacified and sidelined by motherhood becoming almost angelic when she all but returns from the dead for a perfect rockwellian ending but even at this speed some things manage to slip through the cracks of the films slick and overly curated surfaces moments of unwieldy beauty like the bluegreen of the ocean or the films genuine complex emotional spectrum koichis survivors guilt seems to bleed through his dreams and become godzilla itself as if the creature is the manifestation of his personal and japans collective death drive and when he sees what that really means when he witnesses the massive destruction of ginza and the temporary death of a loved one his scream seems to carry the pain of an entire nation this personal approach certainly gives the damage on screen weight if not quite breadth but it starts to become problematic by the third act because godzilla is such an impossibly large threat its hard to make its defeat feel intimate all things considered then a citizens army is probably the next best thing for reasons completely not worth going into pure contrivance neither the occupying american or japanese governments are willing to fight godzilla so the people must come together and the politics of the film really start to show theres a certain illusory criticism of imperial japan in one of this new armys rousing and sappy speeches  which is smothered in the goopy and helplessly selfserious music much of the film is burdened with  this country has treated life far too cheaply a scientist with an absurd plan to kill godzilla reflects and while its easy to agree that sending soldiers like koichi to kill themselves for a doomed war effort is objectively bad the film goes no further than that conclusion when they say life they mean japanese life and japanese life alone and its not the method itself thats the problem since koichi will send himself to almostcertain death before the kaiju is bested anything beyond this mildly stated criticism of the governments disregard for its own people goes unmentioned and theres certainly no hint toward the massive war crimes they just committed were left only to conclude that the real problem is that the empire wasnt effective enough that it lost godzilla becomes the perfect excuse for remilitarization  a talking point of the japanese right since american occupation  and less an outlet for a rambolike revenge against a reimagined occupier or a dirge for a prebomb world than a way for the japanese people to rise above the shame of defeat thereby mostly ignoring horrors of the occupation and sidestep an empire that failed to live up to their nobility and strength continuing its project mostly uninterrupted its no more jingoistic than the average american military movie sure but those deserve all the criticism leveled against them too on paper the handsomely mounted and emotionally charged minus one might be the best godzilla movie in nearly 70 years but in practice its something much less thats not to overstate the revolutionary potential of the rest of the series nor locate their virtues only within politics but if koichi and the citizensoldier had built the oxygen destroyer  which in the 1954 original had to be destroyed once godzilla was defeated because no man could be trusted with such power  its hard to imagine the film would have trouble letting them keep it for another day for the next mission in all monsters attack the escapism of godzilla helped a lonely young boy see something beyond the sad state that surrounded him but in godzilla minus one the escapism becomes a militaristic wet dream of power and destruction a fantasy world where japan can reassert their might with perfect justification
Dec 4 2023,positive, godzilla minus one with ryunosuke kamiki minami hamabe sakura ando hidetaka yoshioka munetaka aoki written and directed by takashi yamazaki rated pg13 for creature violence and action 125 minutes in theaters the first thing we see is a bomb because thats where it all began isnt it the smashing new creature feature godzilla minus one was made as part of toho studios 70th anniversary celebration of their signature monster and is by my count the 33d gojira film produced by the japanese studio and the 37th godzilla movie in total if you want to include those embarrassing american attempts but the skyscrapersized radioactive lizard never belonged over here anyway he originally came to life as a cultures subconscious reckoning with postwwii atomic anxieties about mass destruction and environmental ruin its the same psychological reason american audiences became so stupidly obsessed with superhero movies after 911 people tend to process things through shared fantasies and pulp im told theres currently an apple tv streaming series continuing that dreadful godzilla vs kong picture from a couple years back but in theaters you can see the king of the monsters heading home to trash tokyo in writerdirector takashi yamazakis rousingly assured crowdpleaser this movie rules the aforementioned explosive is strapped to the bottom of a plane flown by shikishima ryunosuke kamiki a kamikaze pilot who feigns engine trouble to get out of meeting his greater glory the wars almost over anyway our young coward gets a second chance to prove his mettle when the island where he put in for repairs is ravaged by a more svelte and smallerthanusual dinosaurtype sea creature a prenuclear upgrade gojira who shikishima has a chance to shoot but chickens out again then we skip ahead a couple of years to 1946 when a firebombed tokyo is trying to rebuild itself out of the ruins shikishima is squatting in what remains of his family home with a fetching street urchin named noriko minami hamabe and an abandoned baby theyve come to call their own sakura ando  so memorable as the mom in hirokazu koreedas shoplifters  plays a nosy neighbor who knows these kids better than they know themselves its a lot of adorable domesticity until a familiar big guy shows up off the coast all grown up radioactive and ready to rumble what makes godzilla minus one such an enthralling experience is yamazakis embrace of straightfaced traditional melodrama combined with cutting edge blockbuster thrills the human story is oldfashioned and unabashedly corny smartly resisting any urge to modernize the period dialogue for contemporary audiences and allowing the characters to fret sincerely about matters of honor and redemption the movie takes place in 1946 and could have been made then as well were it not for the astounding special effects that somehow manage to render the most detailed photorealisticlooking godzilla ive ever seen in a movie but he still kind of lumbers around like a man in a suit with a load in his pants the creature has a great deadeyed stare that is a miracle of cgi yet also ever so slightly resembles a rubber mask this is a tricky needle to thread and yamazaki  who is also credited as effects supervisor  does so brilliantly he gives us all the iconic shots weve come to expect from a godzilla movie  familiar sights like screaming pedestrians being crushed underfoot or the big guys bright blue atomic halitosis  rendered with current technology but a classical sensibility accompanied by a  riproaring reorchestration of akira ifukubes original score the seafaring action sequences crib smartly from jaws and dunkirk while an oldschool stomping of giza blows the doors off most american blockbusters the reported budget for this picture is 15 million and i understand that there are matters of exchange rates and differing national production models to be taken into consideration but still the fact that something this spectacular cost a tiny fraction of any crummylooking marvel movie should have hollywood executives hanging their heads in shame over the past two decades sean burns reviews interviews and essays have appeared in wburs the artery philadelphia weekly the improper bostonian metro the village voice nashville scene and rogerebertcom he stashes them all at spliced personality
Dec 4 2023,positive, not to be confused with the recent american line of godzilla movies from production company legendary pictures godzilla minus one comes from japans celebrated toho studios its tohos first godzilla movie since 2016s shin godzilla and its their 33rd godzilla film since first creating the iconic king of the monsters in 1954 and what better way to celebrate the franchises upcoming 70th anniversary than with a new toho production written and directed by takashi yamazaki who also served as visual effects supervisor godzilla minus one has the feel of some the earliest toho classics both in setting and style of storytelling but dont worry todays stateoftheart visual effects and production design are on prominent display as expected we get some jawdropping widescale destruction and the encounters with the eponymous kaiju are exhilarating yet its the undercurrent of humanity that may catch audiences by surprise takashis story unfolds in the years immediately following world war ii japans infrastructure economy and morale has been decimated its people struggle to put their lives back together living in makeshift homes and barely able to provide food for their families the government offers little help leading to an unstable and vulnerable country its a setting that fans of tohos earliest films will immediately recognize  one thats still rich with political and cultural undertones disgraced kamikaze pilot koichi shikishima ryunosuke kamiki returns home to tokyo only to find his parents were killed and his neighborhood decimated from air raids in the waning days of the war not only is koichi overwhelmed with grief but he also struggles with ptsd and survivors guilt we learn that two years prior he feigned a mechanical issue with his plane landing on odo island rather than carrying out his mission while there the small outpost of mechanics is attacked by a massive prehistoric creature dubbed godzilla by the locals koichi is one of only two survivors in tokyo koichi reluctantly takes in a young woman named noriko minami hamabe and helps her care for an orphaned baby girl whose parents were also killed in the bombing this  family of sorts have a difficult time getting by leading a desperate koichi to take a dangerous government sanctioned job detonating sea mines left over from the war but he and his eclectic boat crew come facetoface with a danger far greater than mines yep godzilla returns and has the japanese mainland in its sights the government tries to keep the discovery from going public but you can only keep a giant lizard the size of a skyscraper a secret for so long inevitably godzilla reaches land allowing yamazaki to let loose with some stunning effectsdrive set pieces brought to life through an array of visual wizardry we witness devastation and destruction on a visually epic scale and then there is godzilla whos presented as a terrifying force of nature yet remains a powerful metaphor for nuclear weapons while the kaiju action he delivers is immensely satisfying yamazaki never loses sight of the humanityrich stories being told at the same time these two facets remain inseparable throughout this surprisingly heartfelt and artful throwback godzilla minus one offers a crash course on how to make a great blockbuster it has the signature thrills and big screen spectacle but its the deeply ingrained human element that make it stand out it certainly left me wanting more godzilla minus one is in select theaters now our friend godzilla seems to be turning up everywhere these days i have heard many good things about this one especially when it comes to the humanity aspect far from being just another monster movie looking forward to it my wife and i went to see the minus color cut today and we were just blown away by how fantastic the film was i really loved seeing the black  white version first as i grew up on those oldtime godzilla films it has become my favorite godzilla movie ever great film i saw this over the weekend  its by far the best godzilla movie since the original 1954 movie  yeah its got great monster action but the story the characters and the writing are all toptier  this is easily my third favorite movie of the year beat only by barbie and oppenheimer  this was also made for 15 million dollars but looks like a 100 million dollar movie  hollywood are you paying attention now this feels like a godzilla film although the trailer for godzilla x kong looks really cool and that last shot of the trailer   i wanna see that  kong and godzilla together kicking ass  yet i do think there should be a new stipulation for all godzilla movies to be made that should feature the song by blue oyster cult  i fucking love the boc it is official as determine by an independent godzilla movie rating agency me that this not one of the best godzilla movies it is the best  period no more discussion needed
Dec 4 2023,positive, in 1954 japanese entertainment company toho changed the monster movie genre forever with godzilla the first film in the studios decadeslong franchise that has spanned four different eras now japanese director akashi yamazaki has helmed the latest instalment that marks tohos 33rd godzilla film godzilla minus one follows kamikaze pilot koichi ryunosuke kamiki who fled from his duty towards the end of world war ii and crashlanded on an island where he first encounters godzilla a dinosaurlike creature upon returning home to tokyo he tries to resume a normal life until godzilla resurfaces threatening the city although godzilla has been a longstanding cinematic icon tohos instalments are not as widely watched as hollywoods recent efforts although the 1998 version starring matthew broderick was a box office bomb legendary pictures rebooted hollywoods take on the kaiju in 2014 while establishing the western version of the monsterverse  with mixed results the latest instalment godzilla vs kong was a covid casualty resulting in a delayed release but it didnt stop audiences from making it a box office hit and was the most successful launch item in hbo maxs history until it was overtaken by the mortal kombat reboot so even after 70 years can tohos godzilla storm western cinemas although godzilla minus one presents itself as a disaster film the narrative has a significant human aspect to it this is mostly driven by koichi who is wrestling with survivor guilt after abandoning his duty and unable to fight godzilla when he sees it for the first time driven by ryunosukes emotive performance and yamazakis screenplay koichis struggles with ptsd allow human psychology and the theme of survival to take centre stage while highlighting the mental toil of exsoldiers and postwar japan this characterdriven plot enables an increased focus on godzilla being an antagonist rather than having supporting characters unsuccessfully understand an alien species which forms a straightforward yet more cohesive narrative  notably man good monster bad as for the kaiju he is a formidable onscreen presence he stalks his prey in the water like the great white shark in jaws his eyes show no fear and his atomic breath effortlessly obliterates everything in its path with naoki satos score booming in the background it is no wonder he strikes fear upon first glance and this resultant terror feeds the films predictable third act that sees a band of civilian and exnaval soldiers including a determined koichi group together to kill godzilla however the simplicity of the story means that most of the characters have little to do throughout the majority of the film koichi his workmates his livein partner noriko minami hamabe and their neighbour sumiko sakura ando adjust to 1940s postwar japan which sees them struggle for food money and work while satisfying certain character tropes the hero seeking redemption the cranky neighbour the unreciprocated love interest the characters continued efforts to resume any kind of normalcy feel increasingly monotonous to the point godzilla needs to return to revive the feature needless to say the action scenes involving the eponymous kaiju  most of which involve some epic seabased combat scenes  lift the film allowing yamazaki and cinematographer kozo shibasaki to deliver exciting and crowdpleasing battle sequences full of eyepopping special effects while godzilla is 70 years old godzilla minus one shows that this kaiju isnt retiring any time soon yamazakis thrilling and occasionally poignant instalment not only reminds us why godzilla is a cinematic icon but also brings back the classic monster movie to the big screen

Dec 4 2023,positive, the way godzilla minus one opens is why storytelling is so important theres not just terror lurking around the corner of a giant kaiju beast with bad breath but a mystery revolving around the central character that is engaging one that sets the tone for the monster picture that grounds the story ever so slightly allowing an outofthisworld action adventure to feel more humanrelatable than ever before the story follows a kamikaze pilot kōichi shikishima a terrific ryunosuke kamiki who lands his ship at a small mechanics outpost under mysterious circumstances finding no empathy from the units lead mechanic sōsaku tachibana munetaka aoki kōichi finds no solace in living another day thats all about to change when godzilla shows up our pilot freezes when ordered to shoot the monster in the head the result is that the entire group dies except for kōichi and tachibana kōichi returns home to find his family has been killed he has nothing left except haunting memories and survivors guilt then by fate he meets a beautiful young woman noriko minami hamabe who has quite literally picked up an infant girl with no parents off the streets they both move into his home without asking and form a partnership as the story progresses and as the child grows shikishima now has a family but refuses to allow himself the joy of it or acknowledge he may deserve it shikishima takes on a job locating and detonating deep ocean water mines its a blatant attempt not just for money but to regain some pride and earn his courage however thats when they learn of an american general named macarthur its archival footage and not bruce willis despite the military leader looking just like john mcclane setting off a nuclear test godzilla is now meaner badder and more indestructible than ever before now kōichi and his friends begin a plan to save their country and the world from total annihilation godzilla minus one is written and directed by takashi yamazaki destiny the tale of kamakura who has a real knack for building tension and knowing how to frame a monstrous disaster picture that being said the dialogueat least the english translationis almost overtly melodramatic even though we can recognize this as a style and even homage to the culture the genre has created almost every syllable particularly between kamikis koichiu and hamabes noriko is overwrought to the point of exhaustion however this does create enough of an emotional resonance and a character story arc for kōichimainly because of the end of a second act tropethat has an emotional heft that carries the audience throughout the picture this storyline leads to a finale with valuable themes and solid messages ones like sacrifice teamwork courage cultural pride and how precious life is some uncommon in previous entries what you are watching is a modernized version of godzilla because we now live in a time where mental health is not about enduring the dark clouds in our lives and living there it is about breaking through and leaving our monsters behind that metaphor comes to a full realization with a deeply felt turn by kamiki hes japans version of tom cruise starring in seven of the ten highestgrossing films in that countrys history this is kamikis moment in fullstar mode and the best performance of the young actors career yet we know you did not come to watch koichiu carry the burden of his fallen comrades no you are here for the giant lizard that will not die for the films wellknown limited budget which was reportedly around 15 to 17 million dollars there are some spectacular action sequences to ooh and aww over in the theater while you butter your fingers with some popcorn yamazaki also was in charge of special effects and deserves praise for his work here while the slower but still empowering scenes of godzilla walking through city streets give the feeling of the old style of suitmation you have the king of monsters riotous runamok through tokyos ginza district and ocean waters are aweinspiring feats of cinematic bliss there is no debate godzilla minus one is not just the best modern kaiju film of all time but the best godzilla film ever made there is no debate godzilla minus one is not just the best modern kaiju film of all time but the best godzilla film ever made i am a film and television critic and a proud member of the las vegas film critic society critics choice association and a  rotten tomatoestomato meter approved however i still put on my pants one leg at a time and thats when i often stumble over when im not writing about movies i patiently wait for the next pearl jam album and pass the time by scratching my wifes back on sunday afternoons while she watches endless reruns of california dreams i was proclaimed the smartest reviewer alive by actor jason isaacs but i chose to ignore his obvious sarcasm you can also find my work on insession film ready steady cut hidden remote music city drivein nerd alert and film focus online
