Mar 24 2024,positive, dune or dune part one 2021 is the second film adaptation of frank herberts 1965 novel series in the future year of 10191 an emperor governs the universe and this universes most valuable resource is spice which aids in interstellar travel but it is only found on arrakis a desert planet the emperor determines which house thank you game of thrones for making these concepts more comprehensible will occupy arrakis and insure that spice can be harvested without interference from the indigenous people the fremen who never consented to the emperors rule the brutal house of harkonnen have occupied the land and grown wealthy as a result of their position but the emperor orders them to withdraw and gives the job to the house of atreides whose head is duke leto atreides oscar isaac and whose home planet is caladan his consort lady jessica rebecca ferguson is training their young inexperienced son paul timothee chamalet in the ways of the bene gesserit a group of women who possess physical and mental abilities even though men do not exhibit these traits however paul is different he dreams of fragments of the future is learning how to control minds and shows physical prowess that other men do not exhibit moving to arrakis challenges the house of atreides to the point of possible extinction but also makes pauls dreams come true why would i a person who had zero interest in herberts novels and did not enjoy david lynchs version through no fault of kyle maclachlan commit to watching not one but two or more dune movies denis villeneuve i found most of his films prior to blade runner 2049 2017 which is gorgeous to be riveting and arresting visuals accompany surprising stories apparently villeneuves lifelong dream was to adapt herberts universe for the big screen so while i am happy that he like paul is finally able to bring his fantasies to life it is not always a good thing for him or everyone else no slander on villeneuves adaptation which i prefer over lynchs take but dune is broad in its characters and narrative it feels predictable and there is zero investment or tension over wellknown characters development villeneuves dune is the cinematic equivalent of a meditation garden gorgeous to watch with its characters polished skin smooth stonelike spaceships sand enveloped landscapes sunlight and shadows playing portentously on golden bronzed metallic surfaces or verdant landscapes contrasting its arid sister planet it is important for visuals to tell the story but the people feel like the supporting actors not the driving force as they float elegantly with their gravity defying suits or trembling shields the more that a persons face is covered the less than the audience can relate to them or should be suspicious of them it is like a tasteful star wars with superb production values but lacking in the raw untidy energy of lucas epic while timothee chalamet may be the headliner dune is an ensemble affair however chalamet sets the dour tone as a brooding wan paul at least cowriters villeneuve jon spaihts who penned prometheus doctor strange and the mummy and eric roth wolfen forrest gump the insider the insider ali munich a star is born killers of the flower moon acknowledge that the man boy does not look like he can hold his own in a stiff wind forget a physical confrontation in one scene paul dodges and catches a minute assassination drone a hunterseeker at the time it seems plausible and deft but as the film unfolds and more impressive warriors cannot withstand such an attack it becomes retroactively impressive pauls slight frame makes sense because if he displays feminine mental abilities he should also possess feminine physical attributes pauls sullen countenance is not chronic and breaks when he spends time with his weapons teachers and fathers faithful aides duncan idaho jason momoa who is still gorgeous but mostly cleanshaven an adventurous cheerful bro type and gurney halleck josh brolin a man determined to teach paul how to fight because the memory of war haunts him paul reverts to his original settings countenance when he is with his parents the weight of his parents expectations his predicament and his visions suppress his youthful buoyancy in retrospect duke leto atreides the scrumptious oscar issac sporting a lush perfectly trimmed beard feels like an inspiration for ned stark and the only person on the chessboard who wakes up too late to the stakes of the pageantfilled game that he is playing and begins panicking long after it is too late to turn things around the duke is the kind of guy that others may not need to go to the trouble of assassinating since he engages in enough activities that could get him killed he fancies himself above the harkonnen because he is respectful of the fremen and treats them like people but he still wants to harvest the spice and make the emperor proud so the only difference is a lack of selfpreservation gene and good manners his disembodied hand on jessicas neck a gesture of love gets framed as a feeble attempt at possession and control his identity is irrelevant in the sequence and he almost does not exist long before he arrives at arrakis the real star of dune feels like jessica ferguson is born to play supernaturally dubious women and jessica in part one may edge out her performance as rose the hat in doctor sleep 2019 because of the range of her characters journey through the course of the film jessica appears to be a privileged mother and significant other but she gets the best lines during the reverend mother and imperial truthsayer gaius helen mohiam charlotte rampling who is incapable of delivering a less than excellent performance despite the heavy veil implementation of a test fear is the mind killer it is like someone else delivering hamlets to be or not to be speech the creative choice suggests that she is being tested as much as paul by refusing to save him there is an interesting power struggle between jessica and the rest of the bene gesserit regarding how to produce the kwisatz haderach through a breeding program if any part of dune feels reminiscent of villeneuves previous films it is the breeding program it reprises themes from enemy 2013 and blade runner 2049 all women in this universe except for fremen women are double agents with their own agenda by belonging to this breeding cult which entwined itself into the framework of this problematic structure while pauls existence and survival would be impossible without them especially his mother at some point everyone views the women with more suspicious than declared enemies by the end of part one jessica bears no resemblance to the woman having breakfast with her son in the opening she is a fierce driven and focused person intent on her mission and survival even though the plot points may be intentional sardonic takes on such tropes as the noble savage and the white savior they simultaneously validate such tropes in the overt storyline it is kind of like the think pieces on saturday night live where a problematic political figure goes on the show and makes fun of themselves showing that you know something is problematic is not the same as not being a problem dune is not doing the same work as bong joonhos snowpiercer 2013 or parasite 2019 where he takes a storyline where the audience expects one welltrod turn of events then subverts it by obliterating all expectations because the narrative is inherently flawed and needs to be flipped narratives like dune understand what is wrong but cannot imagine how to obliterate it or what being right would look like the storys structure is kind of like paul he is aggrieved that his mom and her fellowship are treating him and others like puppets but he rather likes being center stage whether as a dukes son or the fremens champion it is hard to give up benefits of something that works for you it also unironically purveys in tropes like the evil albino evil albino in chief is baron vladimir harkonnen whom stellan skarsgard plays and proves why he thrives in lars von trier films he relishes being unrecognizable under mounds of practical effects and makeup in gender bending casting sharon duncanbrewster plays dr liet kynes a character with ambiguous allegiances who gets an eleventhhour trite backstory but on the way to that moment is mysterious and intriguing as arrakis guardian javier bardem plays stilgar a fremen and largely provides comedic relief dune is a stunning realization of a beloved scifi series but i felt nothing jargon heavy and remote villeneuves proudest achievement feels like a step back in terms of being more than the equivalent of a purveyor of beautiful gowns once the occasion is over it can be forgotten without any sense of lessons that can be extracted to preserve the heart and soul on harsh realistic days of drudgery side note loved villeneuves allusion to famous paintings such as casper david friedrichs wanderer above the sea of fog or jacqueslouis davids the death of marat
Mar 1 2024,positive, synopsis the feature adaptation of frank herberts science fiction novel about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy when it comes to blockbuster spectacles this past year has been filled with them due to several lockdowns worldwide preventing them from releasing in 2020 it seems like many companies from disney to universal are trying to make their voices the loudest in this competition and yet it has been warner bros who have created the most buzz throughout this past year whether their strategy to trying to be the first with tenet or having a dayanddate release plan with hbo max worked or not their blockbusters become staples for the film community denis villeneuves dune is certainly no exception to that rule it may be intimidating thinking of entering the fictional world of arrakis in the form of a featurelength film but villeneuve takes steps to make sure that the film is accessible to any film fan it does not matter whether you have read the source material or not the information given in this adaptation is easy to process and engaging to follow along with part of that comes to the choice of splitting the book up with this film being part one of what will hopefully be a series to come this choice gives the film plenty of time to breathe and digest the world around us villeneuve is known for his incredible sense of worldbuilding and dune is no exception not only are the visuals stunning but the set of characters all help establish the landscape and political state of this time following paul atreides played by timothée chalamet the son of a duke and someone who at a young age is coming to terms with the power his family holds and the religious and political stance his mother follows the audience is eased into the exposition alongside paul as we see him go on an epic journey the visions that paul has throughout seeing his meeting with chani played by zendaya and a ritual duel he must face the audience is immersed into this world and the stakes that are at play throughout even though this is available to watch on hbo max in the us there is no better way to see this film than on the biggest screen you can when the camera pans over the mass amount of desert the vibrant colors light up the screen as the scope of the landscape becomes clear it is not just the huge showcase scenes that are impressive though as cinematographer greig fraser is able to capture the more intimate moments particularly with paul and his mother lady jessica played by rebecca ferguson beautifully and showcase the more vulnerable moments on screen it would be enough of a cinematic experience with just the visuals but the technical elements within the sound are awardworthy the sound design is balanced incredibly well something that most major blockbusters struggle to do the dialogue is clear and easy to understand and yet it does not take away from the roaring of the aircrafts and the action that takes place not only that but this film is accompanied by the best score of the year of course done by the one and only hans zimmer the blend of orchestral music and the vocal choir creates a range of tones that helps accentuate any moment on the screen leaving shocks going through your body in particular the track ripples in the sand used as one of the leading songs in the promotional material for the film highlights just how good this score really is for some people this film may feel anticlimactic and unfulfilling as of this moment due to it being the first part there is no clear resolution as the journey has only just begun but the structure of the film does help answer a lot of questions and the choice of where to cut the film does feel perfect in its own way villeneuve has managed to create a cinematic masterpiece that makes 155 minutes fly right by whilst also begging for another three hours to complete the rest of the story it has been a long time since i have been this excited about a cinematic experience and i hope everyone else goes out to support it as well
Mar 1 2024,positive, approaching a monumental project like dune has destroyed many great filmmakers while david lynchs 1984 adaptation continues to grow a cult following its far from wellregarded alejandro jodorowsky never saw his depiction come to life despite some wild and ambitious plans yet the choice to serialize and break the story into two parts helps denis villeneuves dune shine as a science fiction epic few movies showcase this scale and once again villeneuve proves himself one of the best filmmakers alive however some early pacing issues and the twopart nature make dune feel somewhat incomplete past the year 10000 two rival families come to blows the harkonnens ruled arrakis with an iron fist the planet home to the indigenous freman possesses large reserves of spice however the emperor of the known universe strips the harkonnens of their rights to the planet worse the stewardship of the planet passes to house atreides  fierce rivals of house harkonnen the battle for control of arrakis begins a deadly game one that leaves paul atreides timothée chalamet and lady jessica rebecca ferguson on a collision course with destiny  herberts dune often received criticism for its depiction of colonialism and white savoir tropes unfortunately these issues cannot be wholly corrected with the castings but villeneuve adds more nuance than most directors would his version does not mix words and lays the track for the idea of propaganda working its way into religious sects  villeneuves depiction of the bene gesserit  a group of mystical women who serve as concubines and partners to the heads of houses  is perhaps the most alluring aspect of dune fergusons performance as a woman with incredible power yet few resources makes for an impeccable performance i personally pushed for ferguson in the awards race primarily based on her ability to craft an emotionally affecting performance while still assisting the worldbuilding while there are other performances that stand out ferguson remains the films mvp  the largest issue facing dune part one undeniably revolves around the table setting it must perform by splitting the story into two halves villeneuve sets up an epic second half of the story however it also means that long sequences serve merely as exposition and world building this is not always exciting cinematically and simply repeating desert power does not further explain why the fremon would be so valuable as allies  one sequence when stilgar javier bardem meets leto  works wonderfully other moments become too repetitive such as seeing fremon near paul refer to him as their mesiah across several scenes surprisingly this becomes an issue of tell instead of show a rare moment for villeneuve to overembrace dialogue while dune part one mostly avoids the pitfall the scenes where it does not stick out like a sore thumb  as dune part two  gets ready for release its worth revisiting our introduction to arrakis while the first part feels like table setting it succeeds because of its brilliant visuals villeneuve continues to build an impressive blockbuster resume and has become a master of scifi in the last decade while dune part one may only be the beginning its a culmination of villeneuves journay as a filmmaker and visionary 
Feb 26 2024,positive, ive always been interested in dune but attempts to get into the beefy novel in the past have failed and while i enjoyed the 80s cheesefest adaptation it didnt really feel like id experienced the alltime classic so when this film came along and was said to be only half the book due to how accurate they aimed it to be i was excited but also weary of potentially the second film not being made so put it in the back of my mind until part two was official then i sort of forgot about it until now so with part two about to hit cinemas lets take a look at the first half of the original dune story shall we in the far flung future the planet arrakis is among the most valuable as its the only planet in the known galaxy that produces a substance called spice that allows interstellar travel for many years the rich and now superwealthy due to owning the spice trade house harkonnen have ruled over the planet but suddenly a call comes from the emperor that theyre to leave as their rival house house atreides are the new owners of the fiefdom this is the general set up that and on arrakis there are native people known as the fremen who have fought against the harkonnen for decades the focus soon narrows on our lead protagonist paul atreides timothée chalamet who is not only the son of atreides leader duke leto atriedes oscar isaac but also the son of lady jessica rebecca freguson a member of the bene gesserit a cult of sorts that have the ability to influence and even command people by the use of their voice and despite the gesserit being exclusively female jessica has been teaching paul in their ways paul has been having visions recently about arrakis more specifically a girl played by zendaya and due to this is increasingly invested in his dads plan of siding with the fremen to create a large army to fight off the inevitable attack by the harkonnen as the atreides get settled on arrakis we find out that the harkonnen leader baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgard has made a deal with the emperor to wipe out house atreides and thanks to this not only does he have his own army led by his nephew glossu rabban dave bautista but also a couple of regiments of the emperors guard to do the deed after a scene where leto and his son explore the local climate which includes large spice mining craft that has to deal with a colossal sand worm that sees paul nearly killed when he accidentally inhales some spice in the air and has another vision it becomes night and the attack begins while leto falls though he does nearly kill vladimir in his final moments paul and jessica manage to escape thanks to the efforts of atreides swordmaster duncan idaho jason momoa and the local ecologist and judge of the change liet kynes sharon duncanbrewster but end up having to travel the dangerous sands of arrakis when they use their commanding voice to down the harkonnen ship they were on it goes without saying given the cast but the acting is top notch and thankfully the visuals match it especially the deserty world of arrakis itself which is handy given the majority of the film takes place there plus the soundtrack is mesmerising and played just right you could argue a slow pace across its two and a half hours though to me that was perfect as it really did need everything to be set up and for you to care about these people before it comes crumbling down and id understand annoyance if you went into the film not knowing this was a part one of two but i can only say that i really enjoyed my night in with the film and im frankly glad i waited this long because having to wait years for part two wouldve been a killer dunes first half lived up to the hype as a mix of political intrigue scifi storytelling and a large selection of really interesting characters all with great visuals and sound design to match the two and a half hours flew by and left me really looking forward to more which is something very few films that length can claim roll on part two as paul and his mother survive a night on the sands the new duke of atreides has another spiceinduced vision this time of himself and the mysterious girl starting something of a war across the known galaxy and deposing the emperor as they watch the bodies pile up in their name a vision that scares the boy and has him lash out at his mother for giving him these gifts the two decide to cross the desert to find the fremen for assistance to get offworld in jessicas mind but for paul its all about fulfilling his fathers dream of uniting them so he can get revenge on the harkonnen and reclaim arrakis on the way they narrowly avoid being devoured by a massive sand worm in a great scene you saw in all the trailers
Feb 24 2024,positive, 2021 is a year unlike any other but also a year like every other year  yes theaters reopened kind of yes cinema was saved by three young men in spider suits kind of and yet living in an area not catered to by independent film many of my best films of the year happened right at the end which always makes context difficult on top of that there are films that as of this posting are not available to be seen im looking at you the tragedy of macbeth and the worst person in the world  but i digress as there were still great films to be seen in 2021  here are my top 10 this year minus some movies that i wish made my list i solemnly swear that films like copshop no time to die in the heights and tick tickboom were on my top 10 for most of the year  alas ridley scott provided maybe the biggest surprise of the year not sure that there was a movie with worse press leading up to its release a rashomonlike story about a sexual assault directed by a man yikes  and yet it all works ben affleck gave us one of my favorite characters of the year and jodie comer is a top 5 female performance for sure her subtle and unsubtle acting choices differentiating the three versions of the story take us on a serious journey not only into the events but her characters psyche throughout plus the titular duel absolutely lives up to the hype  the brutality of the time is encapsulated perfectly in ridleys vision this is one of the many late comers to my list but mass was worth the wait yes it is stagey it is basically in one location  but the screenplay and simple camerawork draw you in and brings you into horrific pain looking away never feels like an option and that is due to four near pitchperfect performances picking a favorite seems trite as they all build on each other but it was wonderful to see jason isaacs being given a chance to bite into a serious role again he along with all three leads deserves both serious awards consideration and a chance to play these types of characters again welcome to the year of the musical as a fan i am here for it i actually have three musicals in my top 20 but this is the best of them yes there is one gaping hole of charisma in a lead but the other lead and supports make up for it ariana debose lives up to rita moreno rachel zegler passed sondheims test and mike faist absolutely owns riff but still the most important pieces are behind the camera from the audacious opening shot to the decision to stage america off of a rooftop spielberg cinematographer janusz kaminski and a fabulous adaptation from tony kushner enable west side story to make all the right choices for a 2021 update the first of three foreign language films may be the most difficult film on my list not too expected given that it is adapted from a short story from haruki murukami short story the film dares to truly take its time not every journey is worth three hours but the performances of hidetoshi nishijima and tôko miura carry the film even in moments of silence drive my car will not be for everyone but for those willing your patience will be rewarded in the purest form of empathy available for cinephiles this year possibly the most beautiful and near inscrutable film this year is david lowerys epic arthurian tale in a film world full of obvious explanations the green knight provides precious few dev patel proves once again that you can use a diverse cast of phenomenal actors and it doesnt make one bit of difference he defies your sense of supposed believability and completely inhabits the character of gawain patel exhibits sensuality insecurity and honor all in one beautiful two hour stretch lowery proves once again that he is a do everything filmmaker that love him or hate him has a singular vision worth watching look let me get this out of the way  im a fan of the book and i was completely sure that no one could do this but by god mr villenueve found a way part art film part big budget science fiction dune really hit all the marks there are even moments that surpass the novel especially the relationship between leto and paul mainly due to a heartfelt speech from oscar isaac stunning cinematography paired with a perfectly cast film especially jason momoa of all people ends up with a truly rewarding big screen saga for the ages just give me part 2 already this was definitely the movie i looked forward to most this year i mean its paul thomas anderson the man hasnt made a bad movie yet its weird to find a movie underwhelming at number four but i firmly expected this to be my favorite of the year but it is still obviously fantastic most of the complaints about the film are wildly overblown but it is a challenge alana haim and cooper hoffman shine and it is especially lovely to see normal looking people in major film roles licorice pizza also provides maybe the most fun low speed vehicle chase in film history it is a grand fun romantic ride that i guess will provide even more greatness on rewatch much has already been said about jane campions western masterpiece and for good reason it is indeed truly great benedict cumberbatch gives a career best performance american accent and all his switch from terrifying monster to tough love mentor and back again is truly one for the ages campion in a change from previous work zeroes in on toxic masculinity with a laser focus that is wildly uncomfortable to watch the power of the dog proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that you do not need pure good character to root for to make your movie not just watchable but engrossing  yes yes the movie where she has sex with a car  its real and it is phenomenal i did not think that i could be more impressed with julia ducournau after raw but this is somehow even better her lack of concern with being accepted or understood by mainstream audiences is infectious titane plays with gender parental relationships and sexuality in equal measure it is a near impossible film to describe or recommend but here i am doing both if you actually want to be pushed as a film viewer ducournau is the director you should be watching she managed to make a movie weirder after making a film about cannibalism some of the most stunning imagery of the year wrapped in a film that sticks with you for months ugly and beautiful pedro almodóvar and penélope cruz are obviously a match made in cinephile heaven it seems like no one gets her skill set quite like pedro parallel mothers is a rare movie one that completely subverts expectations just with the final scene it feels like melodrama surrounded by political moments that will be forgotten but have faith it all comes together with a perfection that is unnerving the final shot colors the journey we have been on in a way that will haunt you as long as you are paying attention not only am i sure that it will become even better on rewatch but it has actually gained in my esteem the more i think about it this is almodóvar at his most political and romantic an absolute treat for all of the senses

Aug 10 2023,positive, bakersfield calif kget  one new version of an old story that works while another one that fails are among this weeks new entertainment options dune 3 ½ stars director denis villeneuve faced a major challenge in creating dune an epic science fiction production based on the classic 1965 frank herbert novel of the same name herberts writing is so rich and complicated that past efforts to adapt the book have either failed to happen or in the case of the 1984 film from director david lynch could not live up to the power and grandeur of the original writing villeneuve blade runner 2049 has succeeded where others have failed by showing a deep respect for the novel but also being equally aware that the very essence of the production is that it must be entertaining his dune is a visually stunning tale of greed power hope and love that finds sharp contrasts in a monochromatic environment telling the tale in a proper way is complicated by the futuristic world that herbert created as the setting for his story unlike the picturesque beauty of the lord of the rings setting or the intergalactic backdrop of the star wars franchise dune unfolds in a world almost void of color despite the harshness of the location villeneuve has created a film that embraces what should be dismissed as visually bland and shows how beauty can be found in even the most subtle of differences he got great help from twotime oscarnominated production designer patrice vermette twotime oscarnominated editor joe walker twotime oscarwinning visual effects supervisor paul lambert and oscarwinning special effects supervisor gerd nefzer in creating the stunning visuals in the film halloween kills grade ½ star the film picks up moments after babysitterturnedvigilant laurie strode jamie lee curtis her daughter karen judy greer and granddaughter allyson andi matichak have killed myers in the 2018 film halloween they have left him caged in lauries basement that has been set on fire of course myers doesnt die and sets off on a killing spree where the deaths range from grossly bloody to super silly no one should ever have to die by having a car door hit the gun they are firing and accidentally shooting themselves david gordon green danny mcbride scott teems  writers of halloween kills  try to pass off what is shorter than a fortune cookie message as a full movie script the entire story is michael myers kills stupid people who chase him the trio has taken the pathetic horror film trope of having the victims of the killer hopelessly running away until they can be slaughtered and turned it into everyone running toward the killer until they can be slaughtered they were going to get killed anyway but the stupidity level of this movie will make your head hurt cobra kai iii series takes place more than 30 years after the events of the 1984 all valley karate tournament with the conflict between daniel larusso ralph macchio and johnny lawrence william zabka mass two sets of parents reed birney and ann dowd jason isaacs and martha plimpton agree to talk privately in an attempt to move forward years after an unspeakable tragedy tore their lives apart to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Aug 8 2023,positive, initially scheduled to be released in 2020 and postponed many times due to the pandemic dune 2021 has been on everyones radar for over a year and with good reason ever since the release of david lynchs 1984 misfire and an ambitious but flawed 2000 television miniseries as well as the failed release of jodorowskys promising adaptation fans of frank herberts acclaimed novels have been waiting a long time for someone to bring dune to the big screen while preserving the scale and scope of what continues to be one of the most beloved and influential sagas in scifi history  and with master storyteller denis villeneuve arrival blade runner 2049 at the helm a stellar cast and a team of creatives of the likes of composer hans zimmer inception director of photography greig fraser zero dark thirty production designer patrice vermette arrival sicario editor joe walker blade runner 2049 and oscarwinning visual effects supervisors paul lambert first man and gerd nefzer blade runner 2049 it wont come as a surprise that dune is just as enthralling epic and stunning as we hoped it would be though villeneuves latest film isnt at times entirely satisfying narratively speaking its certainly the best adaptation of the novel to date as well as a technically flawless incredibly immersive experience whose impressive worldbuilding requires you to watch it on the biggest screen possible set thousands of years in the future dune is a story that touches upon many themes and takes place in an interstellar society where different civilizations are fighting to gain control of the most valuable substance in the universe   a rare and highly valued natural resource they call the spice which can influence anything from space travel to commerce knowledge and even human existence itself but dunes universe is as complex as it is full of planets whose inhabitants come with different sets of motives and purposes theres the desert planet of arrakis where the spice can be harvested but that is made inhospitable by elements that vary from unbearable heat and frequent sandstorms to terrifying deadly sandworms that tend to show up at the worst possible time living on arrakis are an indigenous spiritual human civilization called the fremen as well as many wealthy oppressors that take turns colonising it sent by the emperor to harvest the spice  when dune begins an imperial decree has just made duke leto of the house of atreides oscar isaac of the star wars franchise and the card counter from planet caladan the new governor of arrakis and that causes friction with the previous residents of the planet the harkonnens rivals of the atreides led by baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård of chernobyl and mamma mia and eager to regain control of the planet the former colonisers start plotting to defeat duke leto and his family  the dukes concubine lady jessica rebecca ferguson of mission impossible  fallout whos part of the bene gesserit an ancient religious order of women with superhuman mental and physical abilities and their son paul atreides timothée chalamet of call me by your name and little women who shares her mothers powers and who also happens to be destined to save the universe and ensure the future of humanity  just like the book the film begins with duke leto jessica and paul embarking on a trip to arrakis with swordmaster duncan idaho jason momoa of aquaman and game of thrones and follows them on a journey where nothing and no one are quite what they seem as the atreides attempt to forge alliances and fight for their own survival paul tries to decode a series of visions that mainly involve a mysterious fremen girl whom well later come to know as chani zendaya of malcolm  marie and hbos euphoria and to master the voice the power of the bene gesserit in the attempt to become the mind powerful enough to breach space and time past and future that many believe to be coming to save the world this brief introduction doesnt even begin to describe the complexities of dunes universe a world made of a myriad of characters and exploring many themes from religion and politics to environmental change all while following a young mans journey of discovery of his own identity and a quest to fulfill his destiny that sees him battling against powerful unknown forces in fact dunes world is so intricate and full of characters locations and unknown terminology that one of the issues with past adaptations of the novels was that the uninitiated struggled to understand the universes dynamics and rules that was the case with david lynchs film where the initial lack of explanations on the nature of the sand and the characters role within the narrative made it hard for people who hadnt read the novel to follow our heros quest  but whats really impressive about dune 2021 is that its surprisingly easy to follow cowriters denis villeneuve jon spaihts prometheus and eric roth forrest gump cleverly weave information into the narrative in a way that ensures were immediately able to grasp the essential facts we need to know about a world that never fails to be absorbing and intriguing as theres just as much mystery and action to keep us entertained throughout in fact its easy not to notice that dune is nearly three hours long as its so effortless to get drawn into an utterly fascinating world we cant wait to explore made all the more compelling by the films sound design and cinematography as well as a series of memorable performances that will have your eyes glued to the screen as a fan of the novels it has been a lifelong dream of composer hans zimmer inception to score a dune adaptation and when the opportunity came along he rose to the occasion by crafting an unforgettable instantly iconic score that highly contributes to giving the film a more defined identity as well as making it more immersive and affecting on an emotional level dark ominous cues make the tension rise and the action become more urgent while percussions draw us into the films mysteries the use of certain notes often gives the film an otherworldly quality and a feeling of suspension of time while a chorus of female voices makes everything more solemn and mystical reflecting the power of the films female characters  and if dunes score and sound design give the movie more depth and meaning its the films stunning worldbuilding that gives us a world that youll instantly recognise if youve read the book and that youll be immediately drawn to even if you havent while the scifi components of the film such as the suits worn by the fremen the sandstorm and a series of buildings ships and props are somewhat reminiscent of arrival the gorgeous desaturated palette that defines arrakis gives us plenty of meditative quiet moments while the mystical quality of pauls visions reflect his mental state as well as the journey thats ahead of him needless to say paul couldnt have been played by anyone else but timothée chalamet who inhabits the role with incredible confidence showing us a character in constant evolution who does what he can to control the forces and voices inside him without losing his own self all while having to unexpectedly take on a new role thats bigger than himself if the films screenplay gives paul plenty of epic memorable lines its chalamet who brings his character to life by letting raw emotion through at exactly the right times showing us a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground who inevitably becomes the leader he was meant to be  which makes for highly rewarding meaningful storytelling sharing many scenes together chalamet and rebecca ferguson complement each other perfectly and the chemistry between them is undeniable  ferguson excels at playing one of the most complex characters in the film showing us a woman whos constantly conflicted between her duties as a sorceress and as a mother and giving us more than one goosebumpworthy scene while also conveying the wisdom of someone whos seen and experienced a great deal during her lifetime chalamet and ferguson are the films standouts but every single cast member gives us incredibly committed performances that help give depth to their characters oscar isaac moves us more than once as duke leto one of the films most likeable characters while javier bardem no country for old men imbues enigmatic fremen leader stilgar with passion gravity and raw power with facial expressions alone  zendayas body acting draws us to her character even if she hardly ever speaks stellan skarsgård never fails to terrify us as baron harkonnen and dave bautista the guardians of the galaxy films and avengers endgame and josh brolin milk and avengers infinity war are just as fearsome as harkonnens nephew and war master among the supporting characters the standout is sharon duncanbrewster sex education who plays ecologist lietkynes who has been genderswapped from the novels one of dunes most fascinating and intriguing characters made unforgettable by the intensity with which duncanbrewster delivers her lines when i left todays screening of dune at the venice film festival i was mesmerised by the craft on display from the films achievements on a technical level to a series of highly believable committed performances that alone make the film so very compelling and absorbing yet i found that something was missing and that something has to do with the films narrative while its no secret that the director would like there to be a part 2 to the film its also hard not to notice that dune would feel absolutely incomplete if it were to stand on its own as not only does the entire film revolve around a conflict that isnt resolved by the time it ends but the ending itself feels like it should be a beginning and it can be very frustrating to get invested in a story that ultimately leaves you with no answers and no real resolution only time will tell what dune will turn out to be as a final product and whether or not it will be developed into something more than a standalone film for now we can enjoy watching an incredibly wellcrafted adaptation thats faithful to the source material while also breathing new life into it and an immersive epic cinematic journey that will absolutely leave you aching for more
Jul 28 2023,positive, the many media attempts at adapting frank herberts epic space fantasy dune speak to its lasting appeal and its potent impact david lynchs 1984 movie defended by the filmmakers most ardent supporters but excoriated by a larger chorus disappointed in the heavy hand applied by house de laurentiis marked the end of a lengthy journey to the screen that defeated the likes of alejandro jodorowsky and ridley scott along the way dreams of what might have been  orson welles as baron harkonnen moebius and h r giger design  gave way to the realities of any faithful adaptation at its best herberts book presents a stunning vision of political power ecologicalenvironmental awareness rulingclass genealogy military conflict thrilling mysticism and religious mythmaking filtered through a messianic heros journey at its weakest dune has too many scenes of people standing around and talking denis villeneuves dune part one is a worthy addition to the collection besting the lynch film in certain ways but still flummoxed and frustrated by the source materials conversationheavy downside villeneuve is clearly a fan a bene gesseritlevel adherent to the weirding way and a desert mouse who respects the shaihulud the directors impressive track record with dazzling ideas andor imagery in settings both smaller prisoners enemy and grander arrival blade runner 2049 raised expectations higher than a guild navigator on uncut spice in dune the filmmaker delivers at least 450 meters of worldbuilding eye candy to remind everyone of herberts farreaching influence villeneuve juggles a huge cast filled with famous and shouldbe famous performers wellsuited to flesh out their occasionally flat literary antecedents some great faces made up lynchs roster including many favorites in the filmmakers stock company and villeneuve could not ask for more capable portrayers in nearly all the principal and supporting roles rebecca ferguson as jessica and oscar isaac as duke leto atreides despite sharing few oneonone scenes walk off with the movie while lynchs screenplay diminished and truncated jurgen prochnows leto villeneuve concentrates the time and attention required to both express the shakespearean tragedy of the red duke and articulate the emotional connection between leto and his son perhaps jodorowsky was on to something when he argued for a 10 to 14hour running time if all goes according to plan dune part two will remedy the insufficient almost fleeting presence of zendayas chani javier bardems stilgar and even dave bautistas beast rabban theres no question that villeneuves decision to divide the book leaves both newcomers and the dune faithful with lots of questions and the empty feelings that go along with unfinished business as many viewers have already noted the second section should have been filmed at the same time and prepared for a 2022 release villeneuves  dune  takes itself so seriously that plenty of observers have dipped their gom jabbar needles into poisoned inkwells david ehrlichs vicious takedown at indiewire is entertainingly arch slightly cruel and not entirely fair peter opaskars wild tongueincheek defense of lynchs version as the greatest film ever made  one of several recent reassessments of the 1984 movie  was posted at arts technica before the critic watched the new one i am glad to live in a world where we already have two big screen interpretations and frank pavitchs fantastic documentary if we dont destroy ourselves there will surely be enough dune by the year 10191 to please everybody greg carlson gcarlson1972 is an associate professor of communication studies and the director of the interdisciplinary film studies minor program at concordia college in moorhead minnesota he is also the film editor of the high plains reader where his writing has appeared since 1997
Jul 27 2023,positive, directed by denis villeneuve arrival and featuring a killer cast including timothee chalamet call me by your name rebecca ferguson the greatest showman and oscar isaac star wars the force awakens the scifi blockbuster of the year is finally here dune tells the story of paul atreides a young man born into a great destiny who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his people as the planet falls into huge conflict over the spice the most precious resource in existence paul and his family must conquer their fear to survive having a cast this starstudded definitely paid off every performance managing to deliver rebecca ferguson was a standout as lady jessica the mother of paul atreides who is competent in using the voice a skill enabling her to manipulate speech to take complete control over others jason momoa aquaman also impressed as duncan idaho a great fighter and commander who does his best to protect his people josh brolin avengers endgame brings humour and heart to the movie with his character gurney halleck timothee chalamets performance as paul atreides was fantastic proving he can lead a movie with ease paul is a very troubled character who battles with who he wants to be and who he is expected to be chalamet managing to perfectly capture every emotion with a cast this big and a story this dense many actors unfortunately did not receive enough screentime for us to root for their character and learn enough about them oscar isaac was underutilised even though he was in a leading role and gave a great performance stellan skarsgard couldve been a much more menacing villain if given more time to shine and fan favourite zendaya euphoria mostly only appears in dream sequences with few lines delivered already proving himself in the scifi department with previous accolades arrival 2016 and blade runner 2049 2017 denis villeneuve was clearly the man for the job his direction is phenomenal which is apparent in every element from the acting performances to the visuals dune is a sight to behold featuring some of the most gorgeous cinematography of the year as we venture to the planet arrakis every shot appears to be meticulously crafted focusing in on the characters as the vast landscapes fill the background  hans zimmer impresses yet again with a heartpounding original score pairing well with the cinematography to create an immersive experience as epic as the score was it unfortunately took precedence over the dialogue at times especially during act 2 when a lot of whispering is used it can sometimes feel difficult to hear line delivery from the likes of oscar isaac and rebecca ferguson which hinders enjoyment as its a huge world being crafted with lots of exposition it definitely demands a rewatch in that respect its important to remember before heading in to see dune that this is only half a story those familiar with frank herberts novels will already be aware of the scope of the source material and the title claims its only part 1 when the play button is pushed on one hand the story feels slightly incomplete as the movie features a lot of exposition and world building feeling more like setup than a complete story on the other hand this is hopefully only the beginning of what dune could be with a lot coming up to look forward to villeneuve does well to include a healthy amount of both character development and world building with actionpacked scenes aplenty to balance out the heavy exposition thankfully dune shows rather than tells allowing the audience to think for themselves and piece it all together it does its best to avoid confusion and if part 2 hopefully comes to fruition it could be even bigger and better dune is a masterful scifi blockbuster that is going to please the majority of its audience the visuals are crying out to be seen on the biggest screen possible easily becoming the movies standout every performance delivers zimmers score is impeccable the characters are likeable and the action scenes are well choreographed and entertaining unfortunately its difficult to give dune full marks as at times it felt like it didnt truly get going and we needed much more development as certain talents were underutilised that being said villeneuve did his best to include vital information to ensure the audience understood the complex story and has set up a delectable world that can only get more exciting from here it is a movie that is likely preferred after a couple of rewatches an activity that fans and critics alike have not found a chore to undertake
Jul 26 2023,positive, a true cinematic treasure that will be cherished for decades to come  gave me the same feeling that i got watching a new hope for the first time this is epic to the highest of standards  i need more right now
Jul 26 2023,negative, the 2022 science fiction epic dune was a passion project embarked on by frenchcanadian filmmaker denis villeneuve villeneuve foreshadowed his ability to deliver breathtaking images as far back as 2013 with his excellent yet underseen thriller enemy which features a gargantuan spider towering above the skyscrapers of toronto dune takes place over eight thousand years from now when humanity under the auspices of a feudalistic empire has colonized various planets in a veiled reference to colonialism and middle eastern oil the most important planet politically and economically is the inhospitable desert world of arrakis informally referred to as dune and the only place in the cosmos where spice a substance necessary for interstellar travel can be found timothée chalamet stars as paul atreides son of the duke of house atreides played by oscar isaac and lady jessica atreides portrayed by rebecca ferguson paul accompanies his parents to arrakis after his father accepts the emperors request to restore stable spice production even though house harkonnen the former stewards of arrakis and sworn enemies of the atreides have other plans apropos of joseph campbells mythology of the chosen one paul might be the messiah prophesized by the desert dwellers who have lived on arrakis for thousands of years villeneuve has taken frank herberts classic novel and crafted a film that strains under the weight of his obvious reverence for the material there is a shakespearean gravitas to herberts writing but the ponderous sense of selfimportance that permeates dune is reminiscent of george lucass star wars prequels the only attempts at anything resembling lightheartedness are two lame jokes that land with a thud near the very start of the film both of which are shown in the trailer visually dune is unquestionably aweinspiring as evidenced by its sweep of technical awards at last years oscars but the special effects dwarf human interactions as evidenced by dunes total shutout from every acting category as with superhero movies the talented cast is in service of spectacle doing little more than providing the expositional sutures that connect one elaborate set piece to the next when the virtual camera does pull away from massive cgi spacecraft sandworms and desert battles villeneuves direction struggles to create memorable performances timothée chalemet delivers most of his lines as if hes battling lockjaw macho warriors played by josh brolin and jason momoa are stereotypical characters that could have just as easily been inhabited by vin diesel and dwayne johnson and oscar isaac is uncharacteristically onenote as pauls father wearing his stoicism like the shroud of turin the rare exceptions include rebecca ferguson as pauls fiercely protective mother  she gets to flex her thespian muscles the most  and charlotte rampling who dominates the screen as the venomous reverend mother of the bene gesserit a sisterhood of witches however if youre a fan of impressive world building and special effects done on a spectacular scale dune definitely delivers the goods to paraphrase roger eberts advice following the home video release of an earlier desertbased epic lawrence of arabia you could watch dune on your tv and enjoy some of its majesty but to experience it properly it needs to be seen on the largest screen possible dune part two is scheduled to premiere in november so those regretting having missed out on the first chapters original theatrical release will be able to catch up with it on its inevitable rerelease ever since he was a teen paul has been involved in some form of film criticism exhibition or production for the better part of two decades he moderated the film discussion group lets talk about the movies which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic del mar theater in downtown santa cruz in 2023 pauls insightful ksqd movie reviews earned him tomatometerapproved critic status on rotten tomatoes 
Jul 25 2023,positive, synopsis paul atreides timothée chalamet a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people as malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence only those who can conquer their own fear will survive its no secret that denis villeneuve is one of my favorite filmmakers ever since incendies all of his films received my highest rating except enemy which i still love tremendously therefore it was impossible to set low expectations for an adaptation of frank herberts dune one of the most prominent scifi novels of alltime the first and only translation to the big screen was in charge of david lynch back in 1984 becoming one of the most impactful movies of the respective decade to receive a cult following despite the wellknown production problems that resulted in a divisive flick i intended to rewatch lynchs version a few days before villeneuves take but due to recommendations from fellow colleagues i stepped back in order to try and feel the immense scale of dune  both technically and narratively  as if it was my very first visit to this vast universe with a screenplay written by jon spaihts passengers villeneuve himself and eric roth a star is born plus the ensemble cast stacked with stars who could lead any blockbuster i entered the glorious imax theater and i left completely and utterly stunned fortunately for good reasons despite the overwhelming hype from overthetop early reactions  journalists craved for that pullquote harder than with any other film this year  i tried my best to not let the global positive feedback impact my expectations too much after all this is only the beginning at the time of this review the second and supposedly last part isnt yet officially confirmed but its a matter of time for it to be certain but let me focus on this first chapter because it has a lot to explore and discuss and i mean a lot the lengthy runtime and deliberately slow pacing dont come as a surprise to anyone familiar with villeneuves filmography with dune his filmmaking traits fit like a glove the lingering camera helps the viewers feel every story beat almost as if the audience is watching a documentary and following the events in realtime ill get to each cast member later but obviously its tough not to feel engaged in almost every scene when so many talented actors are around one of the most challenging tasks about adapting dune is its worldbuilding heavy exposition is somewhat inevitable but villeneuve is able to balance the different voiceovers  spoken in different distinct languages  in seamless fashion the riveting opening sequence with zendayas malcolm  marie narration quickly establishes an intriguing premise to an extremely complex layered story that tackles numerous topics spread across houses atreides and harkonnen as well as the imperial house and the fremen  guardians of the arrakis deserts  thematically dune is one of the richest scififantasy narratives ever probably the most political saga of the genre the constant backstabbing between the distinct houses  atreides has loyalty and mercy as their banners while harkonnen is based on power and brutality  gives rise to discussions about economic growth limited resources climate issues war wealth space travel and so much more villeneuve succeeds in taking a brutally intricate story and making the long runtime worth the viewers investment practically every scene with or without dialogue gets its respective payoff throughout the movie nothing is shown on screen without a purpose even the several shots highlighting the spaceships taking off or landing add to the tension of those moments aided by hans zimmers powerful score and theo greens impressive sound design ill take this last sentence as a transition to write about the awardworthy technical aspects because if theres something certain about this years oscars and similar shows is that this film will receive dozens of nominations technically dune should be the new definition of epic in the dictionary nowadays blockbusters look great regularly but this new adaptation of the famous novel is simply a completely different beast altogether just like blade runner 2049 was in 2017 from the eyegasmic visuals to the heartpounding score every single audiovisual element is meant to be witnessed in the biggest theater on the planet an exceptionally immersive cinematic experience that will please the eyes and ears of every moviegoer  the sound and production design surround dune within a massive scope a truly colossal outrageously big film of all the hyperboles that people have been overusing to describe it i accept with all my heart the ones related to the gargantuan scale of this beautiful piece of cinema the shot selection is onpoint throughout the entire movie dp greig fraser rogue one delivers wide shots worthy of belonging in a museum every frame is dripping with visual quality but the lack of a broader color palette is definitely a personal nitpick in an otherwise technically perfect flick the character work is remarkable to say the least with such a jammed cast the writers develop each character through interesting dialogues and gripping actionwar sequences the viewers will have no issues differentiating each character and associating them with their respective house and role there honestly to be able to balance and encompass so many people and storylines successfully is a monumental task even with the extended runtime the acting is phenomenal across the board timothée chalamet little women proves his haters wrong by compellingly leading a huge blockbuster filled with renowned stars as paul atreides chalamet shows a much more serious side of him and villeneuves style allows the actors expressions to remain on screen enough time to show the viewers what his character is genuinely feeling and thinking however my personal standout has to be rebecca ferguson doctor sleep as lady jessica  the actress offers the best performance of the entire cast demonstrating her outstanding emotional range an incredibly passionate interpretation of the second most important character of the film who adds a mysterious layer to the already tense atmosphere i wont go through the whole cast but i still have to mention stellan skarsgård chernobyl as baron vladimir harkonnen  steals every scene hes in with a fiercely menacing display jason momoa aquaman josh brolin avengers endgame oscar isaac star wars the rise of skywalker and sharon duncanbrewster sex education also deserve much praise zendaya and javier bardem mother are barely in the movie which could disappoint a few audience members if the viewers arent familiarized with the original novel or the 1984s film zendayas continuous presence in the press tour and marketing campaign will feel like false advertising for this movie even though her character undoubtedly possesses a significant role in the sequel the actors are great as expected but their short appearances  mainly the actress  are connected to my major issue with the film dreams are messages from the deep thats the first piece of voiceover heard in dune paul has countless dream sequences vital to better understand his arc as well as the overall plot however both the moments where these are inserted and their quantity hurt the already steady pacing dune is indeed a slowburn but despite knowing its only half of a gigantic movie i still believe this part could have gone even further id gladly watch thirty extra minutes to get a bit more of the fremens arc but the unnecessarily repetitive dreams drag the narrative too much for my taste the more i think about dune the more i love it in fact there are many more memorable scenes than i ever anticipated i vividly remember dozens of sequences whether these are the energetic explosive actionwar scenes  impossible to imagine dune out of the best vfx category  or the highly engaging dialogues such as one with paul and a bene gesserit reverend mother game of thrones fans will find some political similarities that might help them enjoy this saga even more in fact comparisons with two other popular franchises have to be made from a filmmaking perspective some shots resemble the lord of the rings depiction of its famous kingdoms the first time arrakis is seen by the audience is quite similar to when gandalf visits gondor in addition to this villeneuve truly cuts this first part in half in the sense that it feels like this film doesnt have a proper third act in the fellowship of the ring theres still a conventional climax and some sort of final buildup to let the audience know the movie is about to end on the other hand dune ends somewhat abruptly as if someone came in and stopped the projector midway through the film nevertheless from an audiovisual standpoint dune has much more in common with star wars from the enormous spaceships to the actual space travel and various planets its challenging not to find several resemblances bear in mind that sharing common elements doesnt mean a particular franchise is as good or better than the other far from that  in that regard dont forget dune was around way before sw dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals powerful sound design and score and a compelling story surrounded by an absolutely massive scale denis villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography despite some narrativepacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson stand out in a stellar cast where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive from the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting actionwar scenes the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie finally dont forget that epic scififantasy films are quite rare so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas theres enough space to love them all
Jul 24 2023,negative,dune is so engaged in getting the plot right and building an appropriate world that it doesnt have time to let its characters bond or develop a real connection
Jul 21 2023,neutral, synopsys feature adaptation of frank herberts science fiction novel about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy denis villeneuve is a visionary director unlike any other working today whether it is a tale about questioning your life after a traumatic abortion like in maelström 2000 or the pulsing chainofevents caused by a government task force to stop a mexican drug cartel in sicario 2015 although most recent works dwell in the scifi genre all his pieces deal with the search for identity and center on a character who feels lost in his environment for his next project villeneuve wants to tackle dune the frank herbert odyssey that many describe as unfilmable paul atreides timothée chalamet is a gifted young man destined for many great things beyond his understanding he must travel to one of the most dangerous planets in the universe arrakis also known as dune to secure the future of the atreides heir lady jessica rebecca ferguson and duke leto atreides oscar isaac and his people however the atreides arent the only ones trying to conquer the planet the malicious baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård wants a war for the planets supply of one of the most valuable resources in existence melange better known as spice herberts novel has influenced many auteurs to create their visions or franchises notably george lucas with star wars a long time has passed since dune got published and there have been multiple stories like this a young hero is destined to save the world with his unique abilities that storyline of the chosen one or the messiah has been refurbished many times some films go in a more original route while others just stick to the regular formula and fail in this case you feel villeneuves passion for the source material nevertheless his vision arrives lifeless and lackluster his adaptation is divided into two separate parts and it is evident that this is indeed a segment of the narrative because it feels incomplete in structure its not the literature as a whole but the core of villeneuves vision it feels like an extended prologue before going over to part two if it even happens it is the opening crawl from star wars a prelude to what may be considered the good stuff one of the reasons alejandro jodorowsky never got to make his version and david lynchs ended up like that is because of the material it is too large in scope and oeuvre that it would take over three pictures with a 3hour runtime or a 9hour romp to cover it with fulfillment and for a person who hasnt read the book like me you wont understand much of whats going on its narrative is concocted by stonewall scripture that is impenetrable to get through if you arent familiar with it there is also an issue regarding the characters and their development in this grandiose tale since the writers skimmed over some of their arcs and went with a drier route you dont have any emotional devotion to them whatsoever you dont empathize with any nor get reasons to care for them if they get into sticky situations not even the resplendent allstar cast could elevate their galactic trooper personas some deliver a good performance most notably rebecca ferguson as the elegant lady jessica and jason momoa as the wild uncle duncan idaho i wish i had seen more from stellan skarsgård as baron vladimir harkonnen all cakedup in makeup with black oil covering his body playing his villain with a pantomime and egregious demeanor like ian mcdiarmid as palpatine on a more positive note there are some impressive technical aspects in this film that are amusing to the eye the tactility of the atmosphere is strong making you feel the sands of arrakis brushing through the cinema unlike other scifi displays you dont question the artificiality of this fantasy world the costumes and production design are lavish and the cinematography although it lacks a bit of color is nice to look at however when it comes to the visual effects i feel somewhat mixed about them not that it seems shoddy or creaky but at times you can sense the greenscreen mechanics in the background taking you out of the experience for a quick second as the clock ticks to the grand finale an unnecessary cascade of explosions and slaughter meshes into the story you just wish it would amount to something great in the end a piece of cinema that truly captures what the scifi and fantasy genres can bring to the table when executed astonishingly for example lord of the rings return of the king 2003 or star wars the last jedi 2017 villeneuve can build spectacle and innovative tales because we have seen him do it before but his rendition of dune isnt one of them finally the spice opera ends and the only question in your mind is if that was really it i guess well just have to wait to piece the puzzle together because these 155minutes served as a curtainraiser and remember this is only the beginning
Jul 19 2023,positive, ive watched more movies in 2021 than i have any other year and i couldnt be more excited to explore all the different varieties that i was able to discover because of the large amount that i saw relative to years previous i felt like this year i was really able to define my taste in what i enjoyed and why i liked certain pieces of media it became more clear to me what makes a movie objectively good and what makes it enjoyable for me to watch and im so excited that im able to share my list this year of my top 10 favorite movies from 2021 only making a small splash at the box office the eyes of tammy faye moved me incredibly because of jessica chastains transformative performance and the powerful commentary about religion capitalism and greed chastain as tammy faye portrays a morally grey character as someone filled with so much brightness and joy and genuinely believes what shes doing is good contrasted with what we the audience know are disgustingly selfish and offensive acts chastain delivers such a powerhouse performance thats grounded and emotional while staying campy and entertaining to watch in most senses i actually hate this movie watching danielle rachel sonnett interact with her family is almost unbearable to see they push her around literally pull her arms talk about her weight criticize her eating question her career choices and pressure her into a myriad of uncomfortable situations set at a shiva in a tiny house the amount of people surrounding her and desperate for any escape is suffocating it reminds me so much about how i often feel when i go to my own family functions and reminds me why i avoid my family which is why its so amazing its incredibly relatable and its comforting to see that maybe im not the only person who dreads going to family functions as a former theatre person this film hits all the right points exactly as it needs to i ended up quitting theatre ironically after i had already received my degree in it because of how difficult it was to sustain a real career in it andrew garfield is able to teeter the line of the struggles of being a creative without ever stepping into the cliche of the tortured artist as linmanuel mirandas directorial debut he wisely frames the story as semibiographical the framing device is able to enhance and benefit the story by putting songs side by side to the events theyre depicting in both comedic and dramatic senses and it centers on the heart of the musical jonathan larson im a huge fan of animation i often find it frustrating when the medium is only regulated to childrens content so its always refreshing when theres a piece that uses it in a creative and artistic sense to tell mature stories i couldnt be more excited when i heard about flee which combined the medium with the documentary genre making an incredibly rare and beautiful film i was drawn to the material of the documentary as well about a gay refugee recounting his experience fleeing his home country i have the privilege of living in a country where im not persecuted for my sexuality and i believe its important to learn more about those who do not and try to better understand their experience it was incredibly moving and heartbreaking and the animation made the documentary aspect of the film come to life compared to feeling as if it was merely an interview adam mckay is an incredibly divisive filmmaker but i usually fall on the side of loving his work i was a fan of the political commentary that vice was making and i thought the satire and comedy created an absurd and fun watch i was looking forward to dont look up because of the cast and the general vague plot description a lot of criticism has been thrown towards this film for being too obvious but i thought the point mckay was trying to make was incredibly effective and it was nice to see the craziness of the world were living in portrayed as how it actually feels to live in it often frustrating but usually ridiculous at how oblivious and indifferent most people are i could continue watching this film over and over again and i find it hilarious every single time the emotional premise combined with the incredibly poignant and relevant political commentary of the film is great enough but its the performances that really elevate this film originally written to be a one act play the film forces the characters into one room for a brutal conversation for its hour and a half runtime all four members of the ensemble cast are stellar in their roles and the performances they deliver with each one having at least one moment that will prove to you how incredible they all are ann dowd and martha plimpton are definitely the stars of this film and i cant remember the last time i cried so many times in such a short time span underrated and in my opinion an underseen movie nine days is a sort of philosophical scifi that asks the questions of what happens to us before we are born so many pieces of media speculate what happens to us after we die so it was unique to see something from the opposite perspective ironically without even showing any of the characters living their life it really shows us what the meaning of life is and how to find purpose and joy where there might not always be any the outlook on life from the different characters perspectives sets up great dynamics and conversations to sort through and try to find yourself in when youre agreeing or disagreeing its a moving piece that shows us how we can either live as if life is meaningless or we can find joy wherever it may be and i think thats incredibly powerful ill be honest this year was the first time i ever ventured into the marvel cinematic universe i have steered clear of the mcu mostly because i felt there wasnt much to them they were just big budget films made to appeal to the widest audience and make the most money without any sort of artistic purpose i watched wandavision when  it premiered this winter because of the great reception it was getting and i fell in love with both of the main characters but especially with the nuanced portrayal of wandas grief and ptsd by july i watched iron man for the first time and slowly made my way through the mcu trying to hit certain benchmarks before each film came out in some ways i still feel the same way i do about the mcu most of the films from the franchise are good enough but nothing amazing theyre all entertaining but i dont always feel like they have much depth to them spiderman no way home completely moved me by the amount of heart that was put into the final installment of the trilogy by its entire cast and the desire to please fans who cared not only about the mcu but the character spiderman in particular it also expands on the character and the universe its in without getting too complicated and sticking true to the formula that works best for these films was it anything amazing not by any means did it open my eyes as to why so many people love these movies in a sense it was my first huge marvel theatrical experience as shangchi didnt quite sell out and eternals was a critical flop what this movie did was remind me why i love movies even in their simplicity and i cant trade that experience for anything else is this the best thing pixar has ever made i dont think so not nearly by a long shot however this movie means more to me than many other animated pictures ever could while its not explicitly gay the narrative behind luca and its two main characters luca and alberto are incredibly gay coded disneypixar is still hesitant to label and create a gay story especially one with kids involved i want to say as a gay kid this would have been so important to me but honestly i never really knew i was gay until i was a teenager as kids were raised that straight is the norm until proven otherwise thats why as a gay adult this means so much more to me its beautiful seeing two kids just be authentically themselves and have fun with each other in the cute way that kids would have crushes on each other i can see all the criticisms that others might have with this film but to me it holds such a special place in my heart as my most anticipated film of 2021 dune would have had to be very bad to make me not like it i was much too young when the lord of the rings came out and this feels like the first large scale and giant spectacle work since then laced with complex politics interesting themes on religion gender imperialism and environmentalism this has just about everything a fantasyscifi fan could want its world building is so intricate and detailed between the plot and the action sequences its easy to stay entertained through its two and a half hour runtime while some criticized it because  it doesnt feel complete as it only covers half of the book i personally felt satisfied and the ending only made me more excited for the upcoming part two
Jul 19 2023,positive, groundbreaking oscarnominated director denis villeneuve has returned with dune the story of paul atreides played by timothée chalamet the son of duke leto who embarks on a harrowing journey to the most dangerous planet in the universe to preserve the legacy of his family and people at the core of this intergalactic power struggle is spice which has become the most important commodity in the universe based on frank herberts bestselling novel of the same name it is a coming of age story for the kinginwaiting who is forced to put his training in combat and his special gifts to the test on this death defying mission the film explores a variety of themes including facing and overcoming ones fears we also see different relationship dynamics play out on screen as paul learns who he can trust most importantly learning to trust himself chalamet shines in the lead role as he portrays the wise beyond his years duke while still revealing his youth zeal and inexperience rebecca ferguson stephen kings doctor sleep mission impossible  fallout delivers an equally believable performance as lady jessica his mother and concubine to the duke who not only gave him his unique powers but is forced to train him in how to use them think obi wan kenobi and a young luke skywalker as he learns to trust himself she in turn must learn to trust her son as he grows into the man and leader he was destined to be also appearing in the film is jason momoa aquaman hbos game of thrones who sometimes draws criticism for playing the same character in all of his roles while momoa plays the predictable role of the musclebound warrior and swordmaster duncan idaho in service of the house of atreides he breaks the mold slightly by revealing deep love affection and loyalty to paul meanwhile oscar isaac the star wars franchise is the wise and almost fearless duke leto atreides as one of the few characters in the film who isnt some sort of alien being or doesnt have a special power he not only provides a human touch to the film and a connection point for audiences but he impresses as he is able to rule and garner respect and loyalty simply off the strength of his character rounding out the cast are zendaya spiderman homecoming hbos euphoria who in limited screen time continues to show depth and maturity as she evolves from a child disney star as well as oscar nominee josh brolin milk avengers infinity war dave bautista the guardians of the galaxy films avengers endgame and stellan skarsgård hbos chernobyl avengers age of ultron denis villeneuves dune is simply epic in every sense of the word from the acting and action sequences to the score from oscarwinning composer hans zimmer the grandeur of the film is accentuated by captivating shots and landscapes including large and arid sand dunes that not only create a sense of desperation but leave you feeling amazed at the beauty and expansiveness of the world they live in between the shots action and visual effects viewers may have trouble deciding where to look on the screen while the film is said to be true to the original novel viewers will be able to enjoy it without having read the novel or watched the original 1984 adaptation of the film if you like the star wars franchise you will definitely enjoy warner bros and legendary pictures dune
Apr 5 2023,positive, when the theatrical and hbo max release of denis villeneuves new scifi epic dune were still three months away a handful of imax theaters across the us hosted a special twoday dune event the presentation revealed the first 10 minutes of the film as well as 15 minutes of related materials and the movies trailer  i attended the event heres what you need to know to prepare yourself for the film which arrives in theaters and on hbo max thursday oct 21  spoilers ahead from this point on it will be difficult to talk about the experience without spoiling the film so if you dont want any details ruined please stop now  the dune universe is a lot the scale of everything is ridiculous its rules more than a little weird and you could probably spend the time it would take to see this film in its entirety breaking down the galactic politics leading up to the opening scene but instead of holding your hand through all of author frank herberts backstory this film just drops you in the middle of everything you get a brief explanation from chani played by zendaya about why the planet arrakis is important how ruthless the harkonnen family are and that suddenly they left theres a question about who the new oppressors of arrakis natives the fremen will be then immediately youre taken to the bedroom of royal scion paul atreides played by timothée chalamet and his story starts  as a fan of the dune universe i loved this no handholding no background just 60 seconds of introduction and off we go i wouldnt go so far as to say it felt like the introduction you get in the book but the feeling of being dropped into something that feels impossibly big is familiar  im grouping all of the different special abilities you see in the dune universe as powers for the purpose of making this point across all the scenes included in this preview we get to see paul using his voice on his mother lady jessica and master of assassins thufir hawat wield his mentat ability and theres a oneonone fight with personal shields on spectacularly none of these things looked or felt the way id imagined they might in each case what i saw on screen was even more impressive  the unique audio choices that represent the voice the way thufirs eyes instantly go white as he processes information and the skinclose shimmer of a personal shield all made me so excited to see more of each  this was a fascinating detail from the conversation between villeneuve and hans zimmer the legendary composer said it was weird epic space films are always scored with music that sounds decidedly earthly so he sought to find new sounds to help demonstrate how alien these planets truly are he didnt specify just how he invented these new sounds but in the example scenes he certainly nails a strangeness in the score  zimmer also relies on singing especially when someone from the bene gesserit nuns is on screen the higherpitched chanting or softspoken women singing in the background immediately bring a feeling of power and terror to their scenes which is appropriate given everything theyre capable of  ive seen many iterations of the dune vehicles across tv film and video games and ive never felt like any of them fit the descriptions in the books im not sure the vehicles in this new dune movie match whats in my minds eye either but theyre undeniably the coolest versions ive seen so far  the ornithopters in villeneuves dune are more dragonfly than bird in design but they do a great job moving more like the animal than a ship which was the point in the books these small crew ships were always supposed to fly more naturally than mechanically  the carryalls are often described as like an ornithopter but bigger but that isnt what youll see in this film they dont look bad at all but they dont look like bigger versions of the main vehicle  spice harvesters feel truly massive in this film the sheer size of them even as one is fully consumed by a giant sandworm is incredible finally the spacing guild heighliner no longer looks like a space ship and thats great the scale of these vessels were often lost in previous films and shows but this version helps show how insanely big they are  theres been a lot of conversation about whether the fremen eyes were enough in the past their eyes have always been presented on screen as glowing piercing electric blue while that looks great i never felt like it did justice to the way the eyes are described in the books in fact the eyes of ibad are described as being blue within blue with no white at all i think this is more realistically presented in this film it feels more plausible that the blue would be intense but not unnatural 
Feb 10 2023,positive, welcome to the end of the beginning 2021 was a lot of things for a lot of people but a common trend i see is soulsucking it started with an insurrection and ended with another pandemic relapse and while there was a lot of good to come from the year it certainly didnt always feel like it so congratulations on making it to the end of a horrible year 2021 didnt have a lot of interesting marvel projects for me i liked a lot of wandavision loki was fun but the rest kinda just passed by for me my review of eternals is on the site here and i wasnt super hot on the film as a whole as for no way home well i didnt like it its got some soaring highs but most of the film falls flat on its face for me enter shangchi and the legend of the ten rings unlike other films on this list trying way too hard to be something they arent shangchi knows what it is and embraces it completely shangchi and the legend of the ten rings is about arrested development its about the weight of legacies the weight of living up to the greatness that has come before you on a metalevel its a marvel project about having to coexist with other marvel projects and through its vulnerable performances from tony leung and simu liu the film ascends beyond typical marvel fanfare that focus on running away from greatness really resonated with me in a year of creative burnout and while these themes are serious and heavy the film never becomes too dark and cynical its extremely funny with some of the best comedic editing in all of the mcu and with legendary cinematographer bill pope behind the lens its got the best action in the mcu all in all its one of the best marvel flicks of the past decade and easily one of the best films of the year its on disney plus and well worth a watch  malignant is easily the most fun i had at a movie theater this past year not the best movie i watched in a theater those are coming up but the most fun james wan made a horror classic with malignant a film that is best experienced blind if you havent watched this yet please do its campy its funny  its properly scary and most importantly its got some heart behind it like many entries on this list malignant feels like a passion project a love letter to monster flicks of the past and for that its one of my favorites of the year and oh yeah that chair throw is peak 2021 cinema  linmanuel miranda has had one hell of a year from the adaptation of his musical in the heights to his songwriting for disneys encanto there is no arguing that miranda has been at the top of his game and all this is a prelude for tick tick boom a musical created by john larson nearly 30 years ago and brought to life by a bombshell performance from andrew garfield for a film with boom in its title tick tick boom is defined by its smaller moments while other musicals from the year have been defined by the largerthanlife choreography manuels subdued direction is kept close and intimate some of the greatest songs are sung by a small ensemble on a stage but this tiny nature is the magic of tick tick boom its a film that puts you in larsons shoes his small apartment on the east side and lets you live with the anxiety and pressure that comes with being a writer its a film about pushing past your own seven levels of hell to create something great time and time again and thanks to garfields eccentric performance tick tick boom is a film worth remembering it may feel like doomsday but thats when you need to soldier on its on netflix and is worth a watch  this year i got to watch a lot of the blockbusters that came out and this swan song for daniel craigs bond was my favorite of the traditional bunch it does what no other bond film ever has or could it forces bond to grow up and mature ive loved each of the craig era films casino royale and skyfall especially but both films in retrospect leave bond with a lot of emotional baggage thats never been dealt with until now no time to die may have a near 3hour runtime but its paced expertly and lets the emotional stakes take charge so i didnt feel that runtime at all add in a stellar performance from daniel craig gorgeous cinematography from director of photography linus sandgren and great direction from cory joji fukunaga and its one of the years best and an alltime bond film i briefly mentioned linmanuel mirandas songwriting for encanto when discussing tick tick boom and for good reason it slaps from catchy tunes like we dont talk about bruno to the power ballad that is what else can i do mirandas songwriting is on fire with encanto this is further elevated by the flawless work of the animators each character is personified through wonderful design and great vocal performances to cap it all off the story by jared bush bryon howard and charise castro smith focuses on empathy perfectly its on disney and is a wonderful watch for the whole family since the white rabbit trailer dropped for the matrix resurrections i knew we were in for a treat lana wachowski made a film that grapples with loss abandonment artistic intent and more for a legacy sequel that never needed to exist the matrix had its trilogy its story was told and yet resurrections doesnt feel like a tackedon cash grab as i put in my letterboxd review its a legacyquel with something to say its impossible to separate resurrections from the world it is born into a world where the red pill has become synonymous with the altright where studios are willing to leave storytellers behind to build a franchise and where friends and family have been taken away in the most painful of ways the magic of resurrections is that it uses its place in franchise filmmaking to critique grapple and reestablish why stories matter its not primarily an action film its a love story about having your stories appropriated by others and it may be a bit expositionheavy but i love how much passion went into this film the return of keanu reeves and carrie ann moss is fantastic and the new additions to the cast are on fire i especially love the costuming in the film this isnt a standard legacyquel and its all the better because of that  yeah big shocker here the guy who loves space science fiction has dune in his top ten of the year but let me take a stab at this from another angle dune like every work on this list feels like a work of art born of love and passion listening to denis villeneuve talk about dune is mesmerizing and watching this threehour incomplete space movie about a bunch of different houses fighting over space drugs shouldnt work and yet its a world that i become entranced by maybe thats just the power of hans zimmer whose work here is a careerhigh or perhaps its the work of every cast member bringing house atreides to life but i believe it to be the work of a visionary director coordinating it all together to make this massive political space movie come to life the ships are more than huge the battles are explosive and quick and attempts of survival seem futile but its through those fighting efforts of paul timothee chalamet that we are brought into this conflict every piece of this film feels meticulously crafted for the theater experience from the booming score that bombards our hearing to the massive cinematography that fills our eyes dune is a true masterpiece i cant wait to see how this duology ends and if denis villeneuve sticks the landing this may be the best science fiction movie of all time  if dune is all about being huge then coda is the exact opposite small coda directed by sian heder tells the story of rubi rossi the only hearing member of her family a girl in her senior year of school torn between being with her family and following her dreams of becoming a singer much like greta gerwigs lady bird coda is a story that resonates with me as i find myself in a similar stage of life to rubi and christine but its not just the story that is really good in coda its got some of the best performances of the year with troy kotsurand emilia jones standing out its sound design and editing are superb creating empathy for the deaf community through simple and effective sound design with one of the most clever scripts of the year coda made me feel a lot of feelings so its my third favorite film of the year its exclusively on apple tv so catch it there  for the longest time this film held my number one spot for the year its got a nearlimitless depth with each viewing providing something new considering its an adaptation of a poem from the fourteenth century i think thats an impressive feat the film is a road movie split into chapters focusing on the adventure of sir gawain a knight only inname through his journey to the green chapel lowery grapples with ideas of honor purpose and achievement i made an entire post on why this film deserves all the oscars so check that out for an indepth look at this modern masterpiece from david lowery here if you havent watched the green knight go do it its got one of the best 4k releases of the year which enhances the gorgeous cinematography the rich sound design and the ethereal score that permeates the film  the michells vs the machines is the passion project from the artists at sony animation that stole the top spot from the green knight one week ago the mitchells vs the machines is an emotional rollercoaster for the whole family telling the story of katie mitchell an aspiring filmmaker whose relationship with her dad is stuck in production hell when the family road trip to drop katie off at film school is interrupted by the apocalypse the mitchells will have to come together to save the world there is a lot to love about this film thanks to the efforts of director michael rianda and producers phil lord and christopher miller every element of this film feels made to create emotion from the animation style to the hilarious fourthwallbreaking gags its a movie that feels made for me each character is relatable in their own ways and like lady bird and coda its another film focusing on parentchild relationships when the child grows up so yeah its my kryptonite its on netflix now and i heavily recommend this popartinfused adventure to everyone in the family
Nov 28 2022,negative, two of this years highprofile venice premieres dune and the card counter are auteurist works recognizable by multiple of their makers signatures both star oscar isaac and arrive as pandemicaffected productions that try to bear no trace of that circumstance dune finished principal photography before covid19s global spread while the card counter was 34 of the way through production when it hit isaac completed its rescheduled remainder before flying to hungary for dune reshoots optimistically subtitled part i this covers the first of the novels three volumes dune arrives with the unplanned burden of attempting to make the case for the big screen experiencedenis villeneuves been very publicly unhappy with the pandemic initiative of a simultaneous theatricalhbo release the films first act however is regrettably antipersuasive on the theatrical viewing front widescreen shallowfocus closeups of people talking through expository setup frank herberts source novel has infamously defeated previous adaptation attempts thanks to the challenges of compressing a mythology thats surprisingly complicated given how simple it is on a fundamental leveltwo families warring for control over the same territory whose indigenous inhabitants resist both the draw is spectacle yet it takes a long dull time to get there timothée chalamet is paul atraiades next in line to maintain his familys colonialist practices by harvesting spice from planet arrakis and reluctant to assume the enterprise chalamet occasionally shows off plausible swordfighting skills during the first 40 minutesprone to joyously seemingly unselfconsciously gamboling and weaving through most roles here the admirably physical actor channels all that energy into this one action movie direction otherwise hes as weighed down by humorlessly functional dialogue as the rest of the cast easier to identify by archetypal role than their sometimes complicated names mother jessica rebecca ferguson is loving but fearful for paul amidst palace intrigues father leto isaac similarly caring but politically reactionary weapons trainer gurney josh brolin is seemingly hostile but deeply loyal his counterpart duncan jason momoa a emotionalpuppydog alternative leading the bad guys are baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård trapped inside what appears to be a col kurtz latex fatsuit and bald cap and warrior globbu an uncharacteristically uncharismatic dave bautista whose performance tops out the growlsperminute ratio as part of his research its known that herbert read te lawrences the seven pillars of wisdom echoed in pauls journey from ambivalent wouldbe representative to fullon desert rat walking off with arrakiss resistance whether herbert saw lawrence of arabia isnt known but its impossible not to think of it since villeneuves dune unfolds against identicallooking landscapes also shot in jordan yet for all the sand and desert architecture dune underdelivers on both sheer scale and action momoa and bautista are both fine fighters who get relatively little chance to kick ass the rest of the cast is on dialogue duty and most setpieces are of the cg ships crash through cg haze into cg sands variety even i a dune novice knew enough to expect that something called a sandworm would show up eventually and look cool the dialogue promises its arrival throughout like a teaser for the end of the movie youre already watchingand it is in fact pretty neat when it shows up but too little too late dp roger deakins was originally attached to this but split before production for unspecified reasons his three previous collaborations with villeneuve prisoners sicario and blade runner 2049 looked more like each other than they did the directors work with other cinematographers and i liked them more than any of villeneuves other films accordingly here working for the first time with greig fraser villeneuve suggests thatquestions of color grading grain et al asidehe does now have a consistent visual playbook all his own which doesnt turn out to be a good thing there are ominously controlled overhead helicopter desert shots like sicario giganticicist and darkly colored interior sets out of 2049 and gauzy handheld dream vision shots of a woman staring out on an empty landscape around magic hour a la amy adams in arrival these goto approaches are scattered between the more generic dialogue and action and it makes the current limitations of villeneuves visual imagination perceptible the biggest problem though is hans zimmer whose score is incredibly loud and unremittingly the dominant sound for more of the movies 155 minutes than not zimmers approach to musical cultural appropriation has been blithe since at least 1994s the lion king while his subsequent rise to coachella fame has accelerated improbably both worlds collide in dunes score a nightmare barrage of fieldfilling drums punctuated by the odd muezzinish call to prayergiven how fraught the material already is brownskinned desert peoples vs the man the orientalist tinting is poorly thought through every time i went to the multiplex in summer 2016 id walk past an auditorium booming the thunderous punchingsounds foleys and zimmers score from batman v superman dawn of justice and it never failed to make my life a little more unpleasant five years later the most cogent thought i emerged from dune with was hans zimmer must be stopped i cant improve on the coinage paul schrader came up with decades ago to describe his signature works as man in a room movies as he recently reiterated to the los angeles timess mark olsen they usually involve a man alone in a room wearing a mask and the mask is his occupation so it could be a taxi driver a drug dealer a gigolo a reverend whatever and i take that character and run it alongside a larger problem personal or social  in the card counter the mask he wears is a professional poker player and the problem that runs alongside him is that he is a former torturer for the us government so its a mix of the world series of poker and abu ghraiba fully accurate synopsis to which i have little to add the card counter is fully a late auteur effort where economy of means and distillation of thematic intent routinely crosses the line into dramatic lassitude down to perceptiblycharmingly slow driving shots anyone that slow during interstate travel would get rearended in no time isaac is the aforementioned abu ghraib torturer pseudonymous william tell who now bounces from casino to casino grinding out acceptably small winnings at night like the protagonist of an underbudgeted jeanpierre melville movie tell retreats to anonymous nearby motels when he enters he takes down not the mirrors which melville characters stare into before going to meet death but the framed wall art then he sits and journals his thoughts which are peak schrader is there a limit to how much it takes to reach expiation card counters main

american gigolo and lauren hutton speaking on phones separated by a transparent pane my god michelle its taken me so long to come to you gere says and rests his head against the divider as the camera

much further with a reunion now stripped entirely of dialogue and a final shot of just isaac and haddishs fingers reaching out a glass pane separating them in the frames middle this time schrader has his performers hold their position for the entire end credits during which both performers adjust their fingers and drop their wrists as the shot rolls this metaphysical reconciliation is now fully rendered as a feat of mild physical endurance a devotional gesture both odd and touching for the reverence it shows this ending and its faith in its enduring power no matter how many times distilled and refracted  full disclosure i try to read the source novels of films i write about time permitting but there was zero chance i was going to ingest the 700ish pages of dune i did try to read it as a preteen when i made the dumb mistake of trying to read the 50page appendix first and was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of madeup proper nouns wikipedia of course is no substitute for direct knowledge but this entrys credibly thorough and im reasonably sure none of what im about to say is completely offbase
Nov 23 2022,positive, a film is at its core a piece of entertainment while cinema is also a fascinating and diverse macrocosm of art films like dune make the case that intermingling approaches to the medium arent always possible the novel and the film are about a noble house that is given control over the desert planet of arrakis there a mysterious substance explained more adequately in the novel is mixed in with the sand the spice has a psychoactive property that enables the consumer to become hyperaware which helps to navigate ships through the vast and dangerousness of outer space the cast is superb oscar isaac is the patriarch rebecca ferguson his wife and timothée chalamet is his son josh brolin jason momoa change chen and stephen mckinley henderson play military and civic advisors to the house stellan skarsgård leads a rival house with his own raft of servants including dave bautista and david dastmalchian zendaya javier bardem babs olusanmokun and golda rosheuvel play fremen the planets native inhabitants the former three of which have little narrative relevance and dont make their first appearances until late in the film and rounding out the cast are sharon duncanbrewster as an imperial ecologist and charlotte rampling as the head of fergusons bene gesserit religious order science fiction is a way to look at the current political landscape far removed from the actual events and shine a bright spotlight on problematic behaviors frank herberts dune is a perfect example of this and in many ways so much more than this the novel looks at falling republics ecological malfeasance in the pursuit of oil in the case of the novel spice and religion and how seamlessly it can be integrated into a society the difference between a novel and a movie is built on how you can actually review the material and reflect on it with literature you can stop and look up relevant terms learn peripheral information and absorb what youve read with a film all of that introspection must be done after the fact and you are required to be entirely present in the movie and be able to make notes of any unusual situations or ideas that you need to look into later for a casual moviegoer a lot of that information is missed and left merely as confusion director denis villeneuve tries to convey that as simply as possible and he does an admirable job with it but without the core foundation of the written work some of the minutia and subtlety is sometimes missed dune is a film that is largely faithful to the source material and like the lord of the rings which defined how a fantasy novel could be adapted it leaves out some of those details to streamline the film being a film based only on the first half of the dune novel theres perhaps more to be learned from the eventual sequel than could be assessed ahead of time and the movie provides plenty to chew on in the interim the break feels natural and the events to come will be rather interesting to see but it also feels incomplete mostly because a lot of the religious commentary and mysticism isnt given its proper due in addition some of the political machinations of collapsing empires is present and some is absent that too needs fleshing out in the subsequent film solid performances and some gorgeous visuals help absorb the audience into the narrative in ways that would otherwise be challenging villeneuve does well at avoiding overexplanation of the plot and conveys much of what makes the source material involving however in the end dune is a movie that needed more entrylevel information than could easily be experienced in the relative brevity of the motion picture form
Nov 12 2022,positive, a mythic and emotionally charged heros journey dune tells the story of paul atreides a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people as malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existencea commodity capable of unlocking humanitys greatest potentialonly those who can conquer their fear will survive frank herberts source novel is so grand in scale and dense in detail it even has appendices detailing events and terminology that reading it or watching the film requires a phd in science fiction let alone adapting it to the big screen nb if you are looking for a handy primer to the saga read this dunesplaining article from empire so it is quite the flex for director denis villeneuve to helm blade runner 2049 one of the greatest sequels of alltime but an initial box office failure like its predecessor and then double down on making a new version of dune not only that but agreeing to film the first half of the story on the proviso that part 2 would only be made if it is a success it is understandable why people would be nervous about his prospects alexander jodorwskys failed attempt in the 70s is now the subject of a documentary there was also david lynchs 1984 critical and commercial failure somewhat harshly in retrospect despite lynch himself calling it a huge gigantic sadness in my life one of the main issues with lynchs version was the overreliance on voiceover to try and explain the plot also despite its 137 minute runtime once house atreides falls on arrakis the film feels incredibly rushed bouncing from one major plot point to the next until an emotionally unsatisfying climax there is no such issue here in fact the exact opposite as evidenced by 2049 a film in which one could have spent hours immersing themselves in villeneuve is an absolute master at worldbuilding part one takes its time to introduce each new character faction and world in immense detail helping to create a deep connection and emotional investment that will continue in the next film lynchs dune was unfavourably compared to star wars true both stories follow the adventures of one family in an intergalactic war for power however this new version only really looks to that galaxy far far away for inspiration in design like the original lucas trilogy opting to build gigantic sets and film on location to generate a grounded sense of reality within the fantasy as the winds blow spice and sand around the characters here one feels they are right there with them on arrakis  anakin skywalker may have said i dont like sand its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere  however there was clearly no melange on tatooine as if there were he might have enjoyed it a bit more for you dont even need to physically ingest it in the cinema screen to know you are seeing something truly special paul atreides may have a destiny similar to the skywalkers yet so does the actor playing him timothee chalamet has been the internets and film twitters chosen one ever since call me by your name there was symbolic passing of the torch from pattinson to chalamet in the king in a way pattinson going you can deal with all the fangirling and memes for a while im off to do more a24 movies having provided supporting turns for the likes of gerwig and wes anderson here he fulfills his potential as a leading man proving himself worthy and capable to lead a major franchise of his own  like luke in a new hope he starts from a place of tempestuousness trepidation and fear fear is the mind killer after all yet by the end of part one he has taken his first steps into a larger world he grows in confidence strength and physicality as he progresses going from boy to man before our eyes whilst hinting at even greater things ahead chalamet is helped no end by having a fantasy film ensemble to spark and bounce off of some make strong but fleeting impressions knowing they will return down the line such as brolin bautista and skarsgaard of the rest there is no weak link with jason momoa injecting some swagger as duncan idaho and oscar isaac  rebecca ferguson shining the brightest as pauls parents to be honest there are no weak links to be found anywhere no tears in the stillsuits as it were hans zimmers industrial score bagpipes who knew and greig frasers cinematography are simply out of this world so people of the world spice up your life and see dune dont worry about seeing it on the biggest screen possible as some critics would tell you just see it so villeneuve can conduct the final part of this truly epic space opera
Oct 11 2022,positive, as a selfproclaimed denis villeneuve superfan and for that matter a dune novice i found his tenth directed feature film to be a tad too long despite its epic scope jawdropping action sequences and visually stunning images the adaptation of what many consider the most significant sciencefiction novel of all time could not have been easy there are piles of exposition that need to be explained for anyone new to the series for those the first act can tend to be confusing some will even find it convoluted but it is understandable considering the source materials density of course the film opens with the title sequence dune part one so the insight im offering is hardly mindblowing this first installment aligns with the lord of the rings  a necessary step to something better even great  by all accounts villeneuves dune uses about half of the first book even with numerous installments in the series the director said he only plans on doing two films to tell herberts story dune takes place in you know the future duke leto atreides oscar isaac is given the job of governing the planet of arrakis by the emperor a desert planet enriched in spice referred to in the book as melange the richest material in the universe spice has the power to extend life enhance levels of thought and allow travel to move faster than the speed of light this worlds b12 shot even though leto knows of the dangers and likely retribution of baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgard of the house of harkonnen he will do anything to get the planet back this enrages his psychotic nephew glossu rabban dave bautista though the baron seems to have a plan that he hasnt told his followers yet the duke brings his concubine lady jessica rebecca ferguson and his son paul timothée chalame he brought along an army and his trusted advisors including pauls mentors gurney halleck josh brolin and duncan idaho jason momoa and the house of atreides mentat thufir stephen mckinley henderson when leto takes over he shows a kind heart he offers equal rights to the fremen  natives to arrakis they live in the desert and are led by stilgar javier bardem the land is subject to extreme dry heat oh and those giant sandworms that led everyone to know about the noise ordinance all of this happens while paul continues to have dreams of the future others doubt him but jessica suspects he may be the fremens messiah if you thought my synopsis was confusing the film drops you in the middle of a world that somehow manages to be vague and convoluted at the same time however the expositionfilled first act is woven into dialogue that is as natural as one could hope for that credit should go to the script by villeneuve jon spaihts passengers and eric roth forrest gump its informative while still entertaining and you never once think of their vision as anything less than cohesive though dune like rings and star wars doesnt have a breakout character that represents a sense of comic relief momoas idaho has the most fun in his role but the film desperately needs more of this despite my slight criticism over the length and its story that can lean toward the south of sunbaked villeneuves film is wellcrafted and has a maturity that we havent seen in an epic since the lord of the rings its a heck of a ride when all hell breaks loose the invasion scenes that you see in the trailer are spectacular ive never been one to set a moral high ground on how films should be watched particularly with the rising costs of a theatrical experience and not to mention the current pandemic still dune demands to be seen on the big screen the production value exceeds expectations even more than any film i have seen in years the team that villeneuve gathered is of the highest caliber from tom browns saving private ryan art design jacqueline wests the curious case of benjamin button and bob morgans inception costume design greig frasiers rogue one zero dark thirty stunning cinematography and hans zimmers beautiful evocative score it all exceeds expectations however the heavy metal bagpipes were an odd choice then the only thing that can exceed that is the cast that villeneuve has gathered here the cast is pure perfection chalamet holds his own here and it will be exciting to see his growth going forward in this film series i still contend the studio will want to take scrap a part two and make it a trilogy brolin and isaac stand out like ferguson as she continues to find the poignancy in any action heroine she takes on she has wonderful chemistry with bardems stilgard that points to an exciting storyline going forward even if zendaya is underutilized here she will have a more prominent role in future installments overall dunes exceptional qualities far outweigh its minor criticisms if anything the first film feels incomplete which is understandable considering the massive scope if part two is the final chapter perhaps both will make one fivehour film feel like a complete experience instead of one step to the bigger picture marc miller also known as mn miller joined ready steady cut in april 2018 as a film and tv critic publishing over 1600 articles on the website since a young age marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous rotten tomato approved status  in 2023 he achieved that status

Aug 16 2022,positive, its hard not to be excited for a denis villeneuve movie the french canadian director screenwriter and producer has such a compelling filmography i was introduced to villeneuve via his 2010 oscar nominated drama incendies but its his terrific run since then that has turned me into a bonafide fan i enjoyed both prisoners and enemy his 2015 border thriller sicario may be my favorite film of his to date arrival was my 1 movie of 2016 while 2017s blade runner 2049 was a gutsy and heady sequel to a 1982 scifi classic it almost feels like a natural progression for villeneuves next film to be his biggest and most audacious project to date dune is certainly that this massive sprawling sciencefiction epic is the first film in a twopart adaptation of frank herberts 1965 cult novel of the same name packing a hefty budget and a starstudded cast dune is a herculean undertaking brimming with ambition and made with the unquenchable passion of a filmmaker who has called this his longstanding dream there are a number of ways that a project of this size and scope could have gone awry but villenueve is a savvy filmmaker with a dedicated vision ive seen dune multiple times now and i can honestly say that im struggling to find a single bad filmmaking decision anywhere in his movie bold statement i know without question it was the right choice to break this up into two movies this film literally starts with the part one tag and ends around the halfway mark of the dune story as mentioned above this benefits the film greatly because it allows the right amount of time for us to be immersed into this striking and complex world and it allows villeneuve who cowrote the script with jon spaihts and eric roth to acquaint us the many political ecological and societal intricacies that help give the story depth set in the very distant future of 10191 dune tells the story of young paul timothée chalamet the gifted son of duke leto oscar isaac the leader of the powerful house atreides they live and rule on the planet caladan where paul next in line to lead is trained in combat by close friend and house atreides warrior duncan jason momoa and letos top aide gurney josh brolin his mother jessica rebecca ferguson an acolyte of a mysterious sisterhood called the bene gesserit teaches him the secrets of a mysterious inner power he possesses a power thats causing haunting dreams of a troubling future meanwhile on the harsh desert planet of arrakis the brutal house harkonnen ran by the chillingly vile and grotesque baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård have become obscenely rich controlling the planets production of a priceless mineral called spice the harkonnens callously harvest the coveted natural resource avoiding massive sandworms and persecuting the resilient indigenous clan known as the fremen their leader is stilgar a solemn and reticent javier bardem and also among their ranks is chani zendaya a young woman who has been appearing in pauls dreams after an imperial decree orders the harkonnen off of arrakis the emperor grants stewardship of the planet to house atreides suspicious of the mandate but loyal to the call leto accepts with hopes of forming an alliance with the native fremen that proves to be easier said than done after 80 years of oppression the fremen are leery of any new offworlders and can the harkonnens be trusted to leave behind all the wealth and power found in the sands of arrakis  ultimately the film very much belongs to paul a young man trying to find himself while being pulled in every direction as letos heir everyone expects him to be next in line to lead house atreides jessicas sect led by a wonderfully creepy charlotte rampling hopes paul is the one which they intend to use for their own cryptic purposes and the fremen having heard of this messiahlike deliverer wonder if paul might be the fulfillment of that prophecy as villeneuve patiently and methodically lays out his story were struck by the surprising amount of narrative depth not only is dune thematically rich its filled with connected backstory but to the screenwriting trios credit they often and smartly allude to the lore rather than bury us in it yet there are still many layers to their story and its impossible to narrow the film down to one single category of course its science fiction but its also a comingofage story a war movie an antiwar movie a sociopolitical parable another testament to the films richness but without question the movies biggest strength remains its world building from the imaginative costumes to the jawdropping production design villeneuve and his talented team of creators have made a stunningly tactile world and every frame gives us something worthy to consume whether its the lush overcast atreides homeworld with its vast waters and craggy coastlines or the stark yet gorgeous oceans of sand on arrakis that look like golden brown meringue through dp greig frasers camera interestingly the technology of dune leans more primitive than futuristic which helps the world feel rooted in our reality there are no fancy led panels and very little hightech gadgetry even the structures convey this often resembling old ruins rather than stateoftheart facilities the ships are massive and breathtaking spectacles yet designed with a cold austere simplicity the machinery has a rusty industrial look and even the incredibly cool ornithopters which resemble giant dragonflies are a believable evolution of our standard helicopters to the performances i admit to being a bit of a chalamet skeptic ive never thought he was a bad actor just not up to the gushing hype that follows everything he does here he earns the praise hes been getting chalamet brings a boyish petulance to paul in the films early scenes but over time convincingly turns his vulnerability to maturity isaac is fittingly stoic momoa is full of charisma brolin is stern and abrasive ferguson deftly manages the emotionally meatiest role skarsgård is devilishly menacing sharon duncanbrewster is mysterious yet exciting zendaya does fine with the few scenes shes given i honestly didnt know what to expect from dune ive never read herberts book and i dont remember a thing about david lynchs 1984 film perhaps thats why dune 2021 blew me away from its opening shot to the final fade i found myself enraptured and transported villeneuves captivating direction hans zimmers brooding exotic score one of his very best the exquisite sound design the visual feast that screams to be seen on the biggest screen possible together it all makes for a smart evocative and rousing experience that reminded me at every turn of why i love cinema and this is just part one of the story honestly this very well could be my movie of the year  its brilliantly realized and its easy to follow despite the fact that it throws a lot of information and lore at you  i have to give real credit to villeneuve and the writers for making it accessible  i love the 1984 movie despite its problems but this blows that version out of the proverbial water  my biggest gripe with dune is not with the film itself but rather the way the movie was handled by warner bros  this is a bigscreen movie in every aspect so putting on hbo max on the same day as it hits theaters was incredibly stupid  looking at the worldwide box office results my gut feeling is that part 2 will be greenlit pretty soon but for a while it looked like that was entirely up in the air  while i absolutely believe that part 2 will happen anything else dunerelated wont  at least not under the current leadership  hopefully when discovery takes the reigns theyll understand dunes real potential  as it stands denis villeneuves film is absolutely incredible  the sense of scale is unlike anything ive ever seen before  and this is done without 3d  5 stars  absofrickinlutely wow keith what a wonderful review of the movie  i still havent seen it but i read the book and see the movie follows the plot well  im glad he bent towards lotech rather than hitech as he did in blade runner 2049 thanks so much as you can tell im really high on this movie and recommend on the biggest screen possible its a breathtaking experience that genuinely transports you to another world i loved it i have just come back from the theatre after watching this film it is every bit magnificent and your review echoes my thoughts perfectly a timothée chalamet film from the first to the last frame i was reminded of matrix hes the one dialogue stirring the pot fingers crossed that part 2 happens quickly i must have a part 2 if for some insane reason it doesnt get the green light itll be one of the biggest travesties in movie history but im really confident that part 2 will be announced oh theres no doubt that well be getting a part 2  whether it gets greenlit by warner bros in the next couple of weeks or when discovery takes over in march a part 2 is most certainly going to happen  with a movie of this scale you really dont want to not finish the story  the problem is that we wont see part 2 for at least 2 years if they start production soon i know it talk about a painfully long wait i have heard rumors and i emphasize rumors that hbo max was interested in a series from the dune universe who knows but i would be all for it it was a stunning movie even though it wasnt a 100 faithful representation of herberts book it was a fans dream come true being that the book itself was such a complex and grand story i believe dir denis villeneuve really encapsulated the book in this first part movie as best as it can be translated into film  i was left speechless about 10 minutes into the film as i didnt realize how quickly i had become sucked into the entire atmosphere that villeneuve managed to create in the movie fantastic and id also give it a 55 originally 455 as i realize it really does match up fantastically with the book safe to say though i also agree that villeneuves work usually speaks for itself so ill be incredibly excited for the second part to release as well i love your perspective as someone who is a fan of the book i love that it is winning both fans of the book and those with no connection thats a sign of a wellmade adaptation i am also a bit of a chalamet skeptic his range here needs to be a bit broader but that is mostly the writing momoa practically steals all the energy of the movie i am afraid i compared every moment to the 84 lynch version sometimes it excels and in other places it fall short i think the two part decision is the right one as long as they actually do part 2 a great looking film im still not sure it has solved all the puzzles that plagued everyone who has attempted this but i am very happy it exists im really looking forward to reading this review in full when i see this soon i have to keep as much of it a secret as i can but     wow its been hard make sure you let me know how you feel about it i was blown away and really impressed with how denis brought this massive vision to the screen i saw this yesterday afternoon where i realized why i spent more money on the typical afternoon ticket because i went to a dolby atmos screening of the film and it was worth it  im finishing up my own review of the film right now as fucking give me part 2 great review i definitely agree with you about this movie it was truly a fantastic and cinematic experience and i felt that villeneuve was perfect for the feature and did the source material justice thanks jason im so enthusiastic about it ive seen it three times now and have picked up something new each time huge fan of it ive read the books and am glad to read in your comments that it sticks pretty close looking forward to seeing it at some point this is on my must see list and will hopefully catch it i hardly recall the novel  i just couldnt get into herberts narrative and the story didnt grip me but i know many who love it and thats all cool so im looking at this movie from a different perspective  in a way much like you  the main attraction for me was denis villeneuve  ive truly loved his work  especially in the science fiction field  both blade runner 2049 and arrival were fantastic  so i was confident he would handle dune well once again an excellent thoughtful and comprehensive review  thanks my friend absolutely see this on the big screen of at all possible i know see it on the big screen is often thrown out there without much thought but this truly is a testament to the theater experience anxious to hear what you think of it i just received news from legendary that we are officially moving forward with dune part two the filmmaker said it was a dream of mine to adapt frank herberts dune and i have the fans the cast and crew legendary and warner bros to thank for supporting this dream this is only the beginning great review im in the same boat as you never read the books and i never saw the original film and was totally captivated by this bring on part two thank you love that you loved it i was excited for it but honestly didnt expect to be sucked in the way i was i cant get it out of my head
Aug 16 2022,positive,the world building and story telling in this film was completely brilliant everything had a purpose and everything was well planned out meticulously besides the beautiful cinematography hans zimmers score shined throughout
Jul 28 2022,positive,there was a lot of things to like about this film but when it ended i couldnt help but say to myself damn thats it  kennith b inge
Jul 11 2022,positive, hype is the mindkiller denis villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts genredefining science fiction novel has arrived after much anticipation both optimistic and pessimistic before seeing the film i straddled the line of those two camps i didnt enjoy the novel when i read it last year in preparation for its original november 2020 release date still i also value ambition from filmmakers above nearly all other directorial qualities to my surprise and delight like a sandworm rising out of the desert landscape dune snuck up on me until i was firmly and happily in its grips before i even fully realized it one of the storys many hallmarks is its elaborate fictional world the novels unabashedly fantastical worldbuilding is faithfully emulated in the film we follow paul atreides timothée chalamet the heir apparent of the powerful house atreides his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson has trained him in the ways of the mystical group the bene gesserit and his father duke leto atreides oscar isaac has made sure that hes equally prepared for physical combat the allpowerful emperor decrees that house atreides shall take over as rulers of the desert planet arrakis home to spice the universes most valuable product as the family moves onto the hostile new world political complications arise and paul must face his destiny headon  even if it is still a mystery to him and that is the shortest possible description of dune that i could come up with there is enough complicated history power dynamics extraterrestrial abilities locations and other worldbuilding details to fill several file cabinets let alone a hollywood script it is therefore beyond impressive that this adaptation manages to keep the narrative focused and coherent like so many science fiction films seemingly every other line of dialogue involves at least one madeup word and while many films can confuse the audience with such hastily tossedoff otherworldly descriptors dune never loses its viewers it establishes every aspect of its complex world firmly and assuredly if one werent paying complete attention it would still be possible to get lost in the twisting narrative but the film is compelling enough to securely hold its viewers it also happily manages to avoid the knowing cynicism that marvel has made a trend amongst modern blockbusters those films tend to undercut their own power to make the audience feel okay about liking decidedly dorky material by cranking up the selfawareness in a way that only comes across as increasingly disingenuous dune is delightfully imaginary and knows it this is deep unyielding science fiction that trusts in its audiences intelligence and maturity and yet even in its selfseriousness its never dour or too heavy it strikes the perfect tone between dense and entertaining it throws a lot at its viewers but it rewards patience and attentiveness with its wellstructured screenplay but even if you just took the film in as a visual experience youd still be impressed the beautiful and varied costumes do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making characters tribes and clans distinguishable the soldiers armor looks resourceful yet stylish and many of the more decorative outfits are pleasingly ornate just to highlight one costume as an example charlotte ramplings bene gesserit reverend mother looks like a glamorous chess piece in mourning i cant undersell how satisfying it is to repeatedly watch long flowing garments whip around in the desert wind the production design uses an intelligent mix of realworld locations and cgi environments rather than just relying on green and blue screens to transport the characters to alien worlds in this sense it recalls the look and feels of fantasy worlds that have aged the best like those in the lord of the rings series and game of thrones and the visual effects overall are both well rendered and impressively composited which is essential in selling such a vast fictional world theyre particularly adept at portraying the different scales of imaginary objects and creatures both big and small the cast list is also so impressive it is hard to imagine that any potential casting choices came before those with which they landed nobody misses chalamet is an assured lead  hes headstrong in a way thats true to his boyish character while never coming across as arrogant or annoying ferguson was my personal favorite of all the performances acting as a constant source of assurance and stability for both her fictional son and the reallife audience rampling is pure terror incarnate in her minimal screen time  i wish we saw more of her captivating work and jason momoa is a delight as one of pauls combat mentors he brings a welcome light energy to the film while never distracting or undermining the tone dune effectively won me over and brought clarity to a story i previously only found confounding villeneuve adds his usual brains and soul to yet another epic blockbuster property and once again hes secured victory but it is we the audience who gets to reap the rewards of his hard work
Jul 8 2022,positive, a spicewar space opera about feuding houses on farflung planets dune has long been a popculture building block before frank herberts 1965 novel was adapted into a wrongly reviled david lynchdirected film  a gloriously 80s epic led by kyle maclachlan and laced with surreal touches  it unmistakably inspired star wars and also cast a shadow over hayao miyazakis nausicaä of the valley of the wind game of thrones has since taken cues from it the riddick franchise owes it a debt too the list goes on and thanks to the new version bringing its sandy deserts to cinemas will only keep growing as he did with blade runner 2049 writerdirector denis villeneuve has once again grasped something already enormously influential peered at it with astute eyes and built it anew  and created an instant scifi classic this time villeneuve isnt asking viewers to ponder whether androids dream of electric sheep but if humanity can ever overcome one of our worst urges and all that it brings dune tells of birthrights prophesied messiahs secret sisterhood sects that underpin the galaxy and phalliclooking giant sandworms and of the primal lust for power thats as old as time  and in herberts story echoes well into the futures future blade runner 2049 ruminated upon a similar idea in its own way as many movies do indeed ridley scott was hired to helm dune before lynch then made the original blade runner instead so villeneuve is following him again here dunes unpacking of dominance and command piles on colonial oppression authoritarianism greed ecological calamity and religious fervour though like its building a sandcastle out of powers nastiest ramifications and amid that weightiness its also a tale of a moody teen with mindcontrol abilities struggling with whats expected versus whats right that young man is paul atreides as played by timothée chalamet in a stroke of genius casting that seems almost fated  as if returning dune to the big screen had to wait for the call me by your name star the book also earned the tv miniseries treatment in 2000 and we should be thankful that a 90s iteration soundtracked by the spice girls spice up your life didnt ever eventuate when the narrative begins in villeneuve and coscreenwriters jon spaihts prometheus and eric roths a star is born retelling pauls life has been upended house atreides led by his father duke leto oscar isaac scenes from a marriage must leave its watery home planet of caladan to take over the desert world of arrakis previously run by their enemies in house harkonnen its the source of the universes melange stores with the spice making interstellar travel possible spice also expands consciousness and extends lives  and while forced by imperial decree the monstrous baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård chernobyl isnt happy about handing arrakis over to say house atreides move doesnt go smoothly is like saying that its new home is a tad toasty but the tricky transition is just one of dunes concerns another the plans for paul house atreides heir hes being trained as such by the duke security expert thufir hawat stephen mckinley henderson devs swordmaster duncan idaho jason momoa aquaman and weaponry whiz gurney halleck josh brolin avengers endgame but pauls mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson reminiscence hails from the bene gesserit an allfemale group who pull the galaxys strings and she sees him as its fabled chosen one on the page dune sports an abundance of plot of which this film only relays half its title card dubs it dune part one a move only backed up postus release when dune part two was greenlit this opening chapter is never overladen however even if the fremen  arrakis blueeyed indigenous peoples including tribal leader stilgar javier bardem everybody knows and the defiant chani zendaya malcolm  marie  are clearly poised to enjoy a larger part in the sequel savvily one of villeneuves big choices is to let chanis narration introduce the movie it immediately helps to side the feature with the oppressed rather than merely embracing several layers of power from the getgo it also signals a concerted effort to ensure this isnt primarily a story of men it whets the appetite for more too including from zendaya  who doesnt get much screentime but still leaves an imprint thatd stick even in sand treading not only in lynchs footsteps but in chilean french director alejandro jodorowskys  whose aborted 70s stab at dune is chronicled in stellar documentary jodorowskys dune  is a mammoth task bigbudget slams and failed visionary attempts tend to stick in filmic memory plus lynchs movie featured a heap of other future twin peaks stars and sting and a score by toto no one blessed the rains though meanwhile jodorowsky had mick jagger salvador dali and orson welles with pink floyd on soundtrack duties to match villeneuve boasts a magnificent cast all doing their utmost while hans zimmers throbbing notes set an intense and ominous mood as expertly as his immensely dissimilar work on no time to die also did but what gleams brightest in this take on the tale is its breathtaking visuals meticulous plotting a pace that gives the narrative space to breathe and an alluring sense of mystery as well as the ability to prove simultaneously vast and intimate when dunes desert landscapes linger as far as the eye can see they shimmer with heat texture and possibility when the film lurks in palaces bubbling with political scheming it hews slick muted and brutal as lensed by australian cinematographer greig fraser lion these are shrewd choices  pitting the expansive grainy yet inviting against the confined sleek and savage  in a movie that knows how to make every image both count and feel visceral aweinspiring to behold and operatic dune turns a literary giant into a cinematic one it broods brilliantly dreams vividly and muses sharply as villeneuves work see also arrival and enemy does at his best it stages tremendously engaging action sequences too as sicario also did the one drawback as grand and majestic as it is and as much of an astonishing feast for the senses as well it could use a slightly wilder streak dune rarely makes surprising moves  it doesnt quite take a walk without rhythm and it wont attract the worm ethos to heart aka the line from the book thats immortalised in fat boy slims weapon of choice  but its always thrilling immersive and spectacular
Jul 5 2022,positive,villeneuve delivered superbly produced entertainment cinema of visual fortitude aggrandized form and banal contemplation full review in spanish
Jun 25 2022,positive, while were a handful of days behind schedule the letterboxd files with yours truly has returned for another round of things that you couldve already read if you had a letterboxd and followed my account if you dont never fear id never deprive you of these painfully casual film blurbs i wouldnt even dare this week weve got elvis a spattering of william friedkin and wolfgang petersen because why not and more reviews from the vault because i have a job and didnt watch as many movies this week lmao baz you crazy sob elvis is a 159minute atomic blast of rhinestone glory genuinely unsure how austin butler pulled that off and how tom hanks was able to be so evil with that accent a stunner let luhrmann do whatever he wants for the rest of his career can we put to rest the idea walk hard made it to where you cant do a biopic like this anymore literally just hire someone as insane and opulent as baz luhrmann and nail the cast elvis is a rattler no idea how baz decided to put a denzel curry track in the elvis movie but i support maybe not my favorite petersen film but its pretty compelling when its showing the horrors of contagion and how futile we are to nature having actually lived through a pandemic and gotten the virus in question with tons of vaccine flowing through me it is fascinating to see the what if horrors of 90s imagining of what this might look like clearly its going off a disaster movies playbook and the military conniving feels a little trite for how something this serious would actually go but just having lived through a moment where us government severely mismanaged the opening stages of a pandemicincompetence and malevolence at the federal level dont feel that off petersen really found something to say with the state of our leadership at the top with his government trilogy this fire af1 and though this is the least effective of that trio its still a noxious reminder of how we pale in comparison to natures worst cute monkey too god bless wolfgang petersen for mounting such a thrilling phenomenally stupidyetsurprisingly deep studio blockbuster at a time where we need way more of that than spiderman 7 gary oldman snapping in every scene is a hoot i originally intended to only watch an hour of this but it was so magnetizing i couldnt do anything but finish it the classic 90s political thriller complete with an airtight script for 2 hours some great performances and a steady hand from wolfgang petersen i miss clint eastwood acting in other peoples movies just a grand time a scuzzy sundrenched la neonoir where nobody is good forever and everyone has something to hide obviously the car chase is a landmark which what else would you expect from the guy who made the french connection but i was equally impressed by friedkins ability to zap the film of any predictability its just a daring morally dubious copsandgrifters saga with one hell of a willem dafoe performance everything burns its stunning to me we used to live in a world where this was a major release from a movie studio sure it got stomped by star wars but what didnt in 1977 a clear pathway for movies like uncut gems and triple frontier and a whiteknuckle unforgiving descent into a very specific land of desperation one of the few movies where it felt like anything could go wrong at any moment and you feel that tension from opening to closing credits friedkin is a master of shot composition and in building that exact shade of gutwrenching tension that makes you want to yell at the screen theres something powerful that the film thats going to stand as the future of pixar is made by a team of amazingly creative women domee shi elite best directorial debut at pixar since lee unkrich doing toy story 3 staggering talent its got shades of scott pilgrim and aardman which is one of the higher compliments i can give a movie it nails the 2000s feel down to the fact that it feels like one of those 00s liveaction family films aimed at preteens thats a feat i usually dont give disney credit for creative risk anymore and boo on them for pulling this from theaters but this is a step in the right direction you quite literally cant make this movie 10 years ago generational spectacle its the first of a whole but it feels still like a complete journey its one of those rare experiences you cant miss on the big screen  like if you have any love of film at all you must see it at least once in a premium format i think its going to be canon one day  its the shining example of villeneuves talent and what makes him the most interesting director working i mean this seriously  some moments in this rival the same awe i felt the first time i watched 2001 in a theater imax  you just get those goosebumps and feelings of disbelief at what youre watching i still dont know how they pulled some of this off  ill be honest i got a little emotional watching some of this again in such a grand way not just for what we missed during the lost year in theaters but just in appreciating what the best of what the spectacle of moviegoing can give you a movie the bulk of this is very squarely fixed in a bush america and some of the commentary lacks the kind of nuance that weve learned about global politics since it came out i think some of it is the same kind of issue blazing saddles faces now  timely subversion that now looks dated without viral context  but some of it is just parkerstones sense of humor just not advancing past what was allowed at the time some of it is aggressively funny some of it is just not quite there anymore whats surprising is some of its best material isnt even humor  its the darkness that seeps in with the characters and the story the music is solid the puppetry is deeply impressive the puking scene is still the funniest part besides the house cats i really wish there was more here that aged well but its still quite good for what its trying to do its not my favorite thing parkerstone have done but its important for what it accomplished even if what some of it accomplished shows a little naivety and insensitivity as much as the absence of john r dilworth looms over this its very weird he virtually had nothing to do with the revival of courage and didnt sign off on this this is leagues better than the cgi scoob movie that committed the unforgivable sin of recasting shaggy matthew lillard is the only person that should be allowed to play or voice shaggy until his passing this should be us law the tonal clash of courages artsycreepy horror comedy and scooby doos kooky 60s mystery caper isnt nearly as jarring as youd expect no dilworth means the graceful terror of the original courage series is missing but the body horror comedy and abstractions and all the usual beats for courage are present the original show is landmark for animation and one of the best animated series of all time this revival is pretty darn enjoyable in a good fan fiction sort of way thea whites muriel being back and is just as good as ever just before her passing hits hard i forgot what a spectacular piece of voice acting that was and what a great tender character she is she and courages dynamic still hits home so sweet some of this is a little too goofy for its own good eustaces rap number is a choice but its so much better than it has any right to be and just so so much better than the bigbudget animated film meant to spark a cinematic universe it gets both series right and it has lillard right where he needs to be also what a randomly hilariousmoving statement on the relationship the anxious have with calming apps the likely first and last courage family reunion was a nice little thing i didnt know i needed mixing in scoobydoo is a clever little wrinkle that makes this directtodvd ditty worth the time the best and worst of kevin smith rolled up into a delicious burger that gives you the runs as i get uncomfortably closer to 30 i cant help but feel much more so now the burden of time than i did when i snuckwatched this in 2006 that smith places on dante and randal selling burgers and talking pop culture into their 30s as life passes them by and they start to grapple with the fact that theyre not really young anymore you can tell that smith is at war with himself as a creator here still slinging the same shockdisgust humor but wholly unable to fumble the emotional beats that define his best films he cant let go of some truly uncomfortable jokes by todays standard half of randals shtick would get tossed out in millisecond in todays climate for obvious reason which makes some of this movie age like an old hamburger on the sidewalk its not really fair to judge everything on that standard with smith more than willing to answer for randals defeating immaturity with deepseeded insecurity and fear for how small he feels in a world that seems to be passing him by and a past he probably never fully appreciated until it was long gone they say youth is wasted on the young and its clear smith is asking himself and his popculture obsessed audience if they really understand how precious the days of empty chatter with beloved buddies are how the time you spend with those you love and the good you can rummage up to do for others really cements your time on this planet not the big dreams you muster or the life goals you feel bound to complete dante and randal may feel lost in the dog days of the service industry but its that theyre together that makes it worthwhile and even joyous and well worth the menial nature though smiths irony comes with finding that out before so much of it is off the clock you cant always appreciate what youve got while youve got it in abundance which is why life can be so bittersweet smiths penchant for vulgarity and shock value never served him quite like he hoped this of course came before his spat with rotten tomatoes and cop outyoga hosers period when you could tell he was struggling to find his voice as an artist who saw an industry starting to pass him by and a style that was growing more dated by the hour jay and silent bob reboot was actually a pretty nice little comeback vehicle for him and clearly clerks iii might be his best chance in decades to make a sincerely good movie informed by reallife struggle dante and randal have always been his most honest characters and best evolving reflections of self as you can tell randals teary lament to dante in jail is fully smith purging his own insecurities about aging onto the page making randal have a heart attack to directly mimic his own experience really has some dramatic potential that rivals anything hes done in his career it might be the best proving ground hes ever had though you just hope the juvenile sensibilities strike more toward character than offensiveness i get some of randals grossout lowbrow creepy gags are of their time and made to reflect a shallow immature likely dishonest goober who talks a big game and doesnt have much to back up with but his persona is caught between genuine empathy and a damning sense of obsoleteness people complain you cant make this anymore with certain comedies but clearly some of this movies humor is irresponsible and embarrassing thankfully smith has beyond evolved his rhetoric his latest view askew film finds a much more palatable sensibility but youve got to weigh this films good heart smart wordplay and deeply touching character work and performance with its at times bewildering lack of awareness though thats smith for you circles 2006 jeff andersons performance beyond being really nuanced and powerful at its best moments also captures a sense of lowliness and timidity that does make this films most faceplanting moments feel less proud and more selfcritical than smiths page does this is a very good film in spurts and a bizarre rusted time capsule in other ways itll rightfully stay in its time of release and probably will get revisited with some negative attention once the new film comes out for how cringey some of the humor is but also dont forget the beating heart of it all that helps contextualize some of this films lesser angels as sad consequences of living life without full awareness of how precious it is and how wonderful it is to have those around you a glorious overexaggeration jan de bont knew how to give folks a good time at the movies for the goofy moments and aged vfx theres a real sense of terror with the storm and a real sense of excitement for the chase its a great cast bill paxton such a loveable jackass in this and helen hunt does a great job as the anchor for the emotion psh obvs is the mvp though the worlds best stormchasing hype man this is a little long and ridiculous but its also just a tourdeforce roller coaster theme park attraction which is ironic because the actual theme park attraction for this sucked look the russos were a weird ass pick to direct this movie being that the last nonmcu film they made was you me and dupree cherry is a lot of things and at times the russos completely whiff on what theyre trying to say only to be bailed out by their really impressive cast the russos know how to cast well thats the only reason this film at least to me holds itself together its a glossy goodfellas of an addicts descent free of any nuance the russos are not the guys who will give you that but tom holland is a supremely gifted young guy who understands the story much better than the russos do and hes pretty dang good here hes better at capturing the dangers of  boredom and economic disruption better at casting a side eye to the empty dangerous machismo of his military training better at portraying the devastation of ptsd and the inability to find meaningful help for it better at sliding into addiction and eventual ruin the russos dont know how to do any of that convincingly but their filmmaking still somehow refracts back with oomph because they were smart enough to wrangle in holland and ciara bravo who does some underappreciated heavy lifting her the russos are not probably going to make another movie like cherry with some of these reactions devastatingly negative but i found some engagement in this thing its no better or worse at fast food imitation of a better filmmaker than its peers i think theyre doing more refn than scorsese and its again anchored by an actor in a better movie holland is genuinely good here and that military section is genuinely interesting and thoughtful in its brazenness to depict the downsides of army life in such a crass empty way its unafraid to have a more blunt conversion about the 00s wars than some other things ive seen and i liked that about it the addiction drama is grimy and shallow but holland bravo jack reynor and forrest goodluck are so dang good in portraying the darkness and immorality of the moment that it becomes surprisingly watchable i dont think the russos are doing bad work here but i question what happens if the cast falls through its a decent flick but holland earns his stripes a voracious twisted vision of hell a carnival of sin and discord forged in the bowels of something unholy and wretched gaspar noe by means of lars von trier with john waters david lynch harmony korine nicolas winding refn bobcat goldthwait rob zombie darren aronofsky uwe boll the farrellys and tim story serving as creative consultants a disturbing survey of a languishing grave of holiday capitalism screeching from the beyond warnings of greed and excess a demented ballet of gruesome revenge from an ugly amoral soul i feel i am drawn to this film for its pungent nostalgia for the feelings i have when i watch it that cannot be explained for the quality of what im watching but i also defend the filmmaking this is what happens when a film goes so off the rails that it dips into a twilight zone where so many delirious accidents and haphazard creative choices get hocked together into something so unsettling garish crass dated individual there will never be another movie like ron howards the grinch and 2003s cat in the hat these are abominations but also such fascinating time capsules and signifiers for what the universal studios corporate suite thought was cinematically appropriate for the work of dr seuss in a world of mcus and sterile family entertainment i crave something so disastrously captivating as ron howards the grinch its wrong to like this movie but like it i do for all of its festering warts and licked toads its legitimately entertaining in a very selfish way  i find no inherent value in what im watching but i still take great pride in finding value in the experience i think this film works in some ways because there are some genuinely great things about it on purpose and on accident jim carrey is a man possessed  it is the most physical performance of all time and im dumbfounded and deeply fascinated that he did this me myself and irene and man on the moon so close together its like he did the majestic as a way to come off the acid trip he mustve had to go on to be in those consecutive movies i dont like to think he ever took the grinch makeup off  he just stayed in there pushing the brink of his mental stability until he was just grinch nothing less nothing more just grinch its an astounding feat of physical comedy and excess emoting its a miracle he was able to do this and make it so lasting  i mean that rick baker and companys makeup is unbelievable for how it just meshes into the characters the dog is a good actor dog taylor momson is a good kid actor tambor plays smug like a fiddle clint howard is the perfect actor for such a besmirched production getting faith hill to sing the main song over the credits after this nearly twohour psychedelic breakdown is absolutely hilarious this movie should not exist but im so glad it does its a wonderful example of some of the deeply strange stuff that masqueraded as family entertainment when i was a kid im all the better and worst for it i find value in this film its a weird unkempt relentlessly crudeyetdisarminglywarm piece of early 2000s kitsch but its also one of the most popular and rewatched christmas films of all time only a holiday movie could be so bizarre and still garner such adoration and loyalty a cheap sizzle reel of hero worship and political mythmaking telling in its utter inability to find anything particularly laudable about rudy giuliani in flashbacks of his spotty career in public service as a draconian attorneyturnedmayor any virtue bestowed upon him is in imagined dialogue where any of his actions are heralded as the right thing to do because hes rudy a good american and new yorker who loves his city its telling giuliani made a cameo in this to give it his official seal of approval  its mostly the biopic equivalent of blowing smoke up the buttocks i really dont know what to do with the 911 material here its obviously the pivotal part of giulianis public persona what he was mainly known for pretrump giulianis actual response and legacy to that horrible day is much more complicated now than it was when this film was made already coronated as americas mayor a shine that largely followed him nationally up to his time in this current administration its a little shameless to have footage used like this pandering in a way to serve mainly the purpose of telling giulianis story its his movie but this films handling of 911 feels very lacking but it was also released in 2003 before anyone really saw the full picture i dont know james woods performance is kind of just what he used to do in movies banter quickly and yell loudly its a strange balance of wanting to portray giuliani as this moral fortress who also casually cheats on his wife shows no mercy in his law uses the southern strategy to win an election and berates superiors as a showing of strength hes given a glowing aura the story cant organically fulfill on subtle purpose or accident it just shows him as a brash ineffective law and order politician who gets thrust into history and is hailed in the moment for saying all the right things and being at the front and center its not to say he didnt do good things around 911 its just that hes not nearly the unifying hero that this movie tried to make him out to be clearly this film has no cultural currency outside of that twitter clip that went viral not very indicative of the rest of the film which is as a whole listless uneventful and kind of boring but it is a fascinating time capsule to see how reputations get built off of fictional work he was americas mayor because thats what folks were told he was its how trump was seen as a successful businessman who could stabilize the economy stories matter mythmaking in politics is dangerous this film is definitely guilty of this its whatever a madefortv procedural biopic that cant really rectify its desire to glorify its subject with a lifes story unable to provide many examples of why that glorification is wholly deserved i really wonder what the good people at toho thought when they left the screening room after being shown roland emmerichs take on the beloved godzilla its probably like what walt disney would think if those people who make cheap animated films with rob schneider for redbox made a mickey mouse movie godzilla 98 is a thing to behold a doofy creature feature where quite literally everyone is an idiot and common sense and basic physics are thrown to the wind in exchange for lots of explosions and loud roaring the godzilla roar is one of the most jolting noises in global cinema and here its sounded so much all at once you lose sight of it and just get lost in the cacophonous nonsense i cant deny emmerich mustve had the time of his life here because this is a silly movie with a true sense of personality it has no idea its so crazy and lazily written and it marches around like its the second coming of jurassic park jan de bont was originally supposed to make this and i wouldve been so curious to see what that wouldve been like he showed so much clever restraint on speed and emmerich never met a restraint he didnt want to break with 30 tons of explosives hes basically who he is as a filmmaker a much less problematic hokier michael bay who has destroyed the world like 5 times respect is due to how unfailingly sincere he is even if his films have never been particularly great godzilla 98 is a big uninspired contrived mess but you have to at least somewhat enjoy how happygolucky it is like they basically took a big dump on the godzilla mythos and reduced him to a lifeless cgi horror of a dinosaur and i still didnt hate this stupid movie because of how eager it is i really really hated how they lost godzilla so much no one in new york could not keep their tabs on a gigantic monster multiple scenes have everyone asking wheres godzilla like its homer simpson trying to pitch poochie to the springfield tv execs hes right there youll yell at the screen hes right there godzilla is right behind you how did he go from rampaging in the streets to hiding in the sewer system why does the mayor in this get so mad about evacuating the city after a gigantic dinosaur attacks why did this film cast harry shearer to play the news anchor when he also voices kent brockman on the simpsons making a phrase like the disney store has been looted less of a forbidding sign of the times in this movie and more like an episode of the simpsons why was hank azarias character composite for animal the cameraman a slice of new york pepperoni pizza brought to life by a wizard why did they try to lure godzilla by putting down a big pile of fish in the middle of new york city why is the military so stupid in this even by the standards of movie military people is that really godzilla or just a giant stupid lizard who apparently has the ability to lay hundreds of eggs in the span of like an hour much less why was a renowned nuclear physicist taking a picture of godzilla with a disposable camera multiple times why didnt i absolutely hate this movie i think it was because of the french military subplot i did enjoy that jean reno is always great this is ok gleefully dull but with enough earnest panache and spirit that you cant dismiss it outright there is a great moment where matthew broderick a casting decision i actually didnt hate tried to escape on an elevator at madison square garden from a bunch of hungry baby godzillas barely getting the door to close to save his hide he gets to another floor and the door opens he sees a bunch of other baby godzillas chowing down on a popcorn machine they look at him he says wrong floor and closes the door i laughed this was a heck of a bit why couldnt the whole movie just be that godzilla as an ip is fine now this is ironically kind of like the 2001 planet of the apes film i just watched in 2020 this one is probably more remembered since it was such a big thing but theyre both bigbudget onestop pop culture moments that flamed out because no one really liked them this was also far too long but i dont think that really matters at a point liked those practical sets though love those practical sets what a fun nasty little movie tim burton got the raw end of the deal that this wasnt a bigger thing its got such an anarchistic spirit its laughourloud funny its insanely creative the multinarrative layout works well and the aliens are so fun its a better movie than independence day and i wish we talked about this every 4th of july instead of independence day its such a wonderful lampoon of the establishment and hammers in burtons disdain for those in charge its also got the frenetic spirit of a pg13 tex averychuck jonesbob clampett cartoon the dove gag and ensuing no birds sign and the aliens general disdain for birds in general made be howl this movie is a heck of a comedy on top of its delightful parody of scifi tropes im most struck by this rewatch because the animation is starting to really date itself this movie is almost 20 years old that astounds me i was like 8 when it came out and i remember being so enthralled with how weird and funny it was i was laughing so much as a kid in this that i purposefully wet my pants so i could avoid going to the bathroom and miss any of the movie i was that hooked i peed myself in honor of shrek it holds up because its one of those movies that always will its just hard to make an animated movie with this much staying power one that even if some of the animation is looking a little rusty these days still crackles with so much wit and has such a large heart jokes i still laugh very loudly at the duloc welcome song and the exploding song bird the brimstone exchange most all of donkeys lines probably more the welcome song was one of the funniest things id ever seen when i was 8 the timing of that is unreal everything about shrek is good its all at once such an oddball movie and a towering achievement in animation i think one fuels the other hot take shrek is a great movie id kind of seen rumblings about people revisiting this and being kind of awestruck by it and i can happily say i am now in the number that says the 2001 josie and the pussycats movie is fantastic i watched this on hbomax at my fiancées now wife house and when she saw what i had watched she texted me and said did you really watch josie and the pussycats she is a very understanding person i mean yowza where the heck did this come from where was its audience when it came out why am i just now watching this its great its basically using a nostalgic ip as a trojan horse for scathing hilarious satire on the blind consumerism of the late 90searly 00s where people just bought stuff without really thinking hmm why am i buying this is this good is it good for me i feel like weve all become more mindful of being advertised to and about the products we buy but a movie like this still makes you kind of look around and see that we are still a world dominated by brands its that now brands have to play fair er maybe just more fair than they used to consumerism being a means for conformity and a suppression of individual ideas championed by those who are trying to compensate for how their individualism backfired on them is not a theme i expected in the 2001 josie and the pussycats movie i really couldnt have told you a year ago id be singing this films praises mainly because a year ago i had forgotten this movie existed its great unlike a lot of the teendriven movies of its time this one is incredibly smart and has some serious panache to the style it mimics the boy band music video template in its aesthetic which ages more like a wise stylistic decision to date the material rather than a point of convenience in the filmmaking process the entire cast is excellent i mean this in no point of irony tara reid is oscarworthy in this film like on the same level as melissa mccarthy in bridesmaids as are the script songs and maybe even parker posey and alan cummings the satire hits in waves i cannot understate how biting some of it is particularly the way it brazenly skewers the music business and its treatment of the art artists and audience the humor is belly laugh worthy the du jour 20002001 graphic got me right in the kisser the writing and direction are creative and assured and the music is legitimately great du jour in and of itself is such a brilliant sendup of the boy band every single note of satire is just great here the world might be different than when this was made but my goodness this is such a clever endearing madcap film its genius how they pull this off and so sad that few people really grappled with how great it is when it was released its one of the best cult films ive ever seen and one of the flatout best satires period watch this its on hbo max at the time and its legitimately superb we cant go to movie theaters right now but my goodness you can sure plop on the couch and watch the wonderful 2001 josie and the pussycats movie one of the best things ive seen in awhile when i was a kid i didnt watch this a ton after i saw it in theaters primarily because this was the dark disney movie i dont think anyone in my family was keen on revisiting i get why its an inescapably human decidedly nondisney work a gorgeous philosophical rumination on religion moral hypocrisy the infallible nature of man the power of kindness in a world that so often forgoes it genocide repressed human emotion fermented into pious villainy the war within the church for servant love versus moral rule inner beauty societal oppression etc its not a movie 4yearold cory really got im sure and its precisely why though they detract from the films swelling power at times the gargoyles are necessary kids needed yknow something to hold on to and wisecracking rock things do the trick but adult cory loves seeing something like the hellfire music number in a disney movie this is the darkest g movie of all time its like the bambis mom scene for 90 minutes knowing deep down this isnt even quasimodos story and though its thrilling and unforgettable to see him swing through the corridors of notre dame singing about going outside his shelled home its frollos story the real hunchback of notre dame a grotesque man whose devious moral crusades mask his inability to rectify with his own shortcomings and fear of not being good enough for his false sense of righteousness its a disturbingly relevant character and tony jay voices the hell out of him musical numbers like topsy turvy and hellfire just arent things disney does or ever did this film came out during a major transition for disney and it feels like this film slipped through the cracks a happy accident if you will i dont want a watered down liveaction version of this i want the most pg13 g movie of all time to stay how it is if you just kind of let the gargoyle stuff be the jason alexanders gargoyle is attracted to a goat material is almost funny in a really embarrassing way this film is the best thing the studio put out in the 90s that wasnt beauty and the beast aladdin or lion king heck some of the highs here are as good as those movies maybe better in some regards this is a hallmark in taking a basic story trope the boy and his dog and driving in a wholly original delightfully irreverent vision with it at its base i really appreciate that disney didnt seem to hold this one back much the studios output was at a point in the early 00s that in a posttarzan world they were making more nonmusical risks it eventually cratered and they had to return to the songandascene format of the 80s90s renaissance princess and the frogtangled really starting in the second renaissance so some not good movies like home on the range and chicken little slipped through but so did outstanding films like lilo and stitch and treasure planet the voice cast here is just to die for daviegh chase doing this and spirited away in the same year is unbelievable and the animation is gorgeous sanders and deblois really let the backdrops take a dust into hawaiian watercolor feel and when a film this nutty and sweet also have a rigorous artistic backbone these guys also know how to plot story like crazy so you know the pace emotional beats elite and narrative payoff will be there i wish disney didnt beat the heck out of this with that bgrade television show and all the directtovideo sequels because this films legacy deserves the gold standard its one of disneys best animated films and one of its most proudly original its also got the emotional sophistication you expect from the studios best works its the ateam the surfing hawaiian roller coaster ride sequence is earned not bought when a film can pull something like that off so effortlessly to where its not like hey look a great idea thats when you know

Mar 29 2022,negative, there are fans for whom dunes second coming has been anticipated with a kind of religious devotion the first cinematic adaptation of frank herberts cult science fiction novel in 1984 was a film david lynch would rather forget so there were high hopes for denis villeneuves new version could they get it wrong again well yes they could but in a completely different way this new dune has tended to polarise its audiences with some of its detractors now having second thoughts about the 1984 film i remember that movie as a complete mess but history lays the blame on the studio rather than the director david lynch at the time was one of the worlds most acclaimed emerging filmmakers and there were huge expectations it became overambitious with the studios doing much of the cutting and editing and lynch not even present for retakes if lynchs dune could have been conceived as a miniseries such as the highly successful twin peaks 198991 it might have had a better chance there was a threepart miniseries of dunein 2000 directed by john harrison which proved massively popular at the time even lynchs mangled final version clocks in at three hours with a credit to alan smithee the imaginary hollywood director that gets the blame for hollywood movies the real directors want to disown nowadays hollywood has a new method of dealing with a long intractable story turn it into a franchise why make only one blockbuster movie when you can stretch it out to three or four or  in the case of star wars  infinity so when faced with the problem of adapting a complex sprawling novel with no fewer than five sequels todays studios see an opportunity to keep cranking out revenue for years to come to me the new dune felt like one long slow buildup for the movies ahead the major characters and plot details are laid in the battle lines are drawn up between goodies and baddies weve been introduced to the special features of the desert planet but by the time the credits roll it feels as if weve only seen the preamble its often been said that dune is unfilmable and this new version is a tacit acknowledgement that theres more here than can be squeezed into the standard two hours to promise a whole series of films might be dressed up as a gift for fans but theres a lingering cynicism about this project  a feeling that its essentially a way of maximising returns at the box office many years ago i dipped into dune 1959 and found it virtually unreadable but the novel has millions of admirers herbert is famous for dealing with a raft of issues that have become only more important over time theres an ecological theme an analysis of the human propensity to follow tyrants and strongmen a warning about the dangerous nexus of religion and political extremism a look at the appeal and effects of mindaltering drugs and so on name a pressing topic of our time and its there in dune this doesnt however do anything to improve herberts prose style in this he is like so many famous american science fiction writers whose books are full of good ideas and bad writing for another prime example try reading anything by robert a heinlein somehow villeneuve and his colleagues have managed to capture the turgid aspect of herberts prose in this new dune which is jampacked with mournful stares endless mumbojumbo relating to the house of atreides doomy prophecies awesome responsibilities and on and on everybody looks vaguely hungover and grumpy  as if this is the best way of conveying deep seriousness for those of us who havent spent their lives studying the dune novels its portentous and confusing the story is set in a distant future when interplanetary travel is commonplace but for some unknown reason everyone likes to dress and act like figures from the middle ages feudalism seems to be the preferred political system with the known universe under the control of the padishah emperor corrino iv who is every bit as teacherous as the roman emperors the good guys are the noble house of atreides who are invited by the emperor to take control of the desert planet arrakis which provides a valuable spice used for interplanetary travel what they dont know is that their stewardship is simply a ruse a setup for an attack by their hated enemies the warlike house of harrkonen the reason for this doublecross is that the emperor sees the house of atreides as an implicit threat to his power  rather like vladimir putin views the ukraine there is apparently a prophecy or two to this effect with the leading candidate for the messiah being young paul atreides timothée chalamet naturally this makes paul a marked man but he is well protected by his sturdy macho helpers and the mystical charms of his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson who belonged to a sect of cosmic nuns before she married pauls dad duke leto oscar isaac are you following this the star of the movie is a massive cgi desert worm that gets excited whenever it detects a vibration in the sand its acting is far more expressive than any human character yet the natives of arrakis the fremen free men get it have learned how to avoid worms by the end of this first installment paul has hooked up with the desert tribes and absolutely nothing has been resolved i hope this doesnt count as a spoiler but its painfully obvious at the half way mark that  like paul atreides  were in this for the long haul ive generally found its impossible to say whether someone is acting well or badly when theyre kitted out in fancy dress and obliged to intone a lot of sillysounding lines that advance an improbable plot its no surprise that nobody in dune has been nominated for an oscar as a lead or supporting actor not even the worm neither does villeneuve score a best director nomination for his ponderous work the only truly deserved nomination may be greig fraser for some impressive cinematography although it has its fans and admirers dune can count itself lucky to make the shortlist for best picture the good news is that the studio will probably have a further five or more opportunities to improve their standing get ready for a long war of attrition
Mar 28 2022,negative, broadcast television is tanking so badly that abc the television network that airs the oscars has insisted to the academy of motion picture arts and sciences that eight categories be cut from the annual awards telecast including film editing production design sound original score and hair and makeup  worried about ratings and therefore ad dollars abc a division of the walt disney company is willing to ignore the essential crafts of hollywood filmmaking from editing to hairdos in favor of the rancid best original song category that way the aging broadcast tv audience wont miss out on seeing performances by such contemporary crowd pleasers as former countryandwestern sitcom star reba mcentire and maybe even overmodest ubiquitous linmanuel miranda miranda also directed an oscarnominated film this year so if he were to sing his song it would be like if alfred hitchcock had also written que sera sera for the man who knew too much 1956 and had to perform it onstage at the oscars instead of doris day or since miranda has nominations for two movies only one of which he directed if hitchcock had written a song in the king and i this is what a film director is to abcdisney netflix warner broshbo max what film directing has become in hollywood is a teambuilding exercise with lots of group hugs and a publicfacing mascot from the generic world of show biz the mascot could be anyone camerafriendly being a director is now something of an honorary position at that level like being the grand marshal of the hollywood christmas parade abc has lost faith in the films themselves swallowing the rightwing notion that the nominees do not reflect popular taste therefore the less time spent on them the better give the people what we think they want beyoncé and billie eilish anything but actors from these movies olivia colman where are the three spidermen where is the batman the atmosphere in which the highest honors in filmdom are now broadcast to the masses is more like an episode of wheel of fortune in which the contestants cant solve the puzzle no matter how many vowels theyve bought the audience on social media engages in frustration discourse as they watch loserwinners grapple with their moments of professional glory on live tv all so abc can continue to exist in a world that has left it behind its also a world in which actual movies have become marginal especially during the oscars every moment is confused all of it a ritual no one in the film industry believes in anymore but enacts to ward off demons of their future simultaneous release in theaters and on streaming no back end no residuals voiceover work in animation and video games shrinking foreign markets foreign markets where film releases are moral quandaries a series of bad decisions like the ones that led to the suicide squad cameo and the final furthest away specter a world without an in memoriam reel  as i watched this years oscar films a cargo ship called the felicity ace burned in the north atlantic massive and packed with luxury automobiles bound for the us it was on fire and adrift abandoned by its crew its shipment of expensive cars doomed life at the beginning of the pandemic reminded me of the costa concordia the luxury cruise ship in jeanluc godards film socialisme that later sank a metaphor for the shipwreck of capitalism that godard guided into reality in 2010 now this new titanic appeared without people only machines floating aimlessly and aflame as the pandemic moved into a new phase possibly its end phase but probably not coda admirably focuses on the working life of a gloucester fisherman family in which the father troy kotsur mother marlee matlin and son daniel durant are deaf and played by deaf actors and the daughter is not their struggles with the hearing world and with unfair labor practices and their plan to collectivize the docks are the backdrop for daughter rubys conflicted desire to get away from the sea and go to the berklee college of music the deaf characters are easy to relate to in this pleasant unmemorable movie for instance even though i can hear i would have the same confused impatient reactions were i forced to attend a high school musical presented with a group of teens singing david bowies starman i would watch in silent frustration too the issue is that for me it would be easier to forget the selfconscious boredom and fascism of denis villeneuves films along with their sandyinky beigetaupegrayblackbrownorange color palette make them look different than other blockbusters they are in fact postblockbusters and villeneuves unnecessary new version of the first part of dune shows how a depressed attitude that has given in to all that is wrong with current hollywood filmmaking and has also given in to all that is wrong with the world might appear to be new especially to a director who believes mankind still tells stories around the fire at dusk or after dinner or before watching euphoria which zendaya is also in but more often after all as flaubert said about writing salammbô few will guess how depressed one had to be to undertake the resuscitation of carthage same with the resuscitation of dune which already exists as a movie a tv miniseries and a documentary about a movie version that didnt happen and should have the futility and pointlessness of villeneuves secondhand whitesavior epic comes through as laziness to understand that we need only compare one scene from the 1984 david lynch version to the same scene in the new one in villeneuves handinthepainbox scene nothing is charged with hidden meaning and nothing seems painful to timothée chalamets paul it is not much of a trial for him and all the work in the scene is done by charlotte ramplings bruce conner couch costume we know chalamet will not have a problem its already clear he is the one in lynchs version which incidentally occurs in a movie that is not that great by the end but is at least very weird throughout kyle maclachlans paul seems genuinely frightened by being forced to put his hand deep inside a womans box the viewer does not yet understand pauls status in this world and there is no way to know what will happen when he places his hand in this trap where lynch is hallucinatory intense and freudian or in a word hysterical villeneuve is dull and literal and his scene is simply a test that allows the lead character to move up a level like in a video game or a ya novel which we knew he was going to do later in the movie the idea that chalamet could just speak in a certain tone of voice and other people would do exactly what he wanted them to do reminded me of brooklyn teens ordering in restaurants lynchs penile sandworms precgi were better realized and more menacing and the harkonnens whose name is now pronounced differently were more disgusting in 1984 this dune toys with the idea of genocide but its mostly a movie for people who like to memorize things all these stupid names one after another frank herbert was trying too hard so is villeneuve this basic lawrence of arabia tribalism and its jihadmongering with its conflicted son and dangled possibility of revolution were also aspects of villeneuves equally ponderous blade runner sequel since these notions have already appeared in so many other twentyfirstcentury blockbusters it is hard to ascribe them to villeneuveasauteur despite all the black water he dips them in before rolling them in the sand jackie wilson said the troubles were a wee bit of fun now werent they in our little house on our little street which were fine for us when they were being bombed we had perfect tv reception and pap ciarán hinds was twenty years younger than granny judi dench who loved nothing more than winning acting awards pa jamie dornan was handsome and good when he was around and in perfect shape from those fifty shades of grey sessions and ma caitríona balfe was such a putupon knockout mommy like she was in ford v ferrari that she should have been in this a lot more instead of it being such a balfe fast our director kenneth branagh he loves shakespeare and agatha christie and yes even thor which he reminds us of with a shot of a comic book but in blackandwhite unlike the splashy marvel comics in west side story which is also set around the same time has a lot of music in it and is about two sides fighting a turf war belfast is in black and white so branagh can separate it from his hack work because its a personal story from his childhood and because documentaries about the past are in black and white or monochrome as netflix calls it now when promoting films like passing and belfast takes place in the past and its about real things that happened 2021 was a big year for bw and this movie falls in line with one of its current uses telling stories for dads branaghs explosion of treacle with jude hill as a cuddly blond toddler was the most popular mike millss cmon cmon with joaquin phoenix as a public radio producer shepherding a neurotic little kid woody norman was enervating to the point of narcolepsy the opposite of what branaghs doing in belfast it was unlovable  the best of these films and therefore the most ignored was alexandre rockwells sweet thing in which his own daughter and son lana rockwell and nico rockwell are menaced by an alcoholic father who will patton plays with every stop pulled out a performance of total fuckedupedness a man trying to be nice before he loses it completely and swirls down the drain rockwells film also featured van morrison music like belfast but not in the same celebratory uninhibited way sweet thing is set in a kind of fairytale skidrow present and shot in new bedford massachusetts without any cute irishness even though theres no doubt some could have been located in the area sweet thing confronted american racism and child abuse and cops shooting black kids none of which were presented as fun like the troubles in belfast though rockwell placed them in a beautiful film where his use of black and white was justified and worked it made sweet thing more immediate not less it was clearly a gen x movie about childhood in which rockwells memories of freedom and neglect were poured into a constricted dangerous present sweet thing was also unlike millss film which took place coast to coast in dullsville usa and catered to and indulged kids while recapitulating white parental selfregard instead of exposing it like rockwell did in his film cmon cmon terrible title attempted to do that through documentary scenes with black parents and their children that struck me as wellintentioned copouts it therefore made sense that phoenix worked for npr in it but i dont think that was the idea  nicole kidman and javier bardem are postlife versions of lucille ball and desi arnaz in being the ricardos spruced up and perfected by computers and surgeons to exist as animatronic forms whose ability to handle drama and comedy surpasses anything humans could do back in the 1950s creating these androids on his keyboard and in the studio must have been so difficult for aaron sorkin that he dropped his own mask and finally admitted it was entertainment not politics that has interested him all along what else could explain the outright fabrications in this movie which include a phone call from j edgar hoover in front of a live studio audience that washes away lucille balls 1930s membership in the communist party and makes everyone cheer this rightwing appeal to hoover and the fbi is the opposite of clint eastwoods in j edgar 2011 where eastwood and leonardo dicaprio carefully outlined how a police state was created in the us that sorkin glosses the mccarthy era like this and places himself to the right of eastwood is surprising but it makes sense because no one in hollywood is more aligned with the entertainmenttech industrywashington politics nexus than the powerloving successworshipping unionhating sorkin somehow this extended to slighting karl freund the german cinematographer of i love lucy who invented the threecamera sitcom setup thats still in use seventy years later why sorkin chose to do that is also telling it made desi arnaz look smarter sorkins goal with all his protagonists  jessica chastains performance as tammy faye bakker disgraced televangelist wife and singer borders on the monstrous by the end it almost crosses over into a kind of american fellini it doesnt though because the eyes of tammy faye is a whitewash of this con artists life like her husband jim bakker andrew garfield tammy faye was a grifter who preyed on the homebound via broadcast tv convincing them to send money so that their souls would be saved and they would go to heaven the bakkers of course lived in luxury and built a christian theme park with that money no one at any time seems to have brought up that they were turning jesus christ into mickey mouse chastain and her screenwriter and director want us to believe tammy faye was an ambitious but godfearing christian puppeteer desperate to get out of her minnesota hometown the film excuses her insisting her christianity was deeper than that of her televangelist competitorsjerry falwell pat robertson and their ilk though it is clear tammy faye empathized with gay men stricken with aids and tried to convince her followers to treat them as human beings not as the pariahs the reagan right wanted them to be this fact doesnt exonerate her as a christian it was the least she could do her second husband a church builder and developer played in the film by sam jaeger ran afoul of the law just like her first the film however shows tammy faye alone at the end toughing it out in a crap condo not married to conman number two  the fun here is supposed to be in watching chastain transform from a cute peppy and horny biblecollege student in the late 1950s into the fullon divineinajohnwatersmovie look of tammy fayes infamy thirty years later while she is never not a chipper cornball high on her own supply she is never tragic either because like a trump wife she shits in a gold toilet garfields jim is a closeted prissy fake yes but tammy faye is a grotesque with a bettyboopmeetssarahpalin voice unhappy because shes blinkered to reality through it all the bakkers audience of twenty million kept sending them money whenever tammy asked though she did live in a lifesize dollhouse her fate was to become a national joke not the heroine of an ibsen play king richard demonstrates step by step the value of sticking to your plan even if some folks think youre crazy i dont mean richard williamss plan to turn his daughters venus and serena into tennis champs i mean will smiths plan to win an oscar williams like the actor who plays him knew the value of finely tuning a capitalist product and introducing it into the marketplace as a brand this is a business movie which reaches its height not when venus williams saniyya sidney almost wins her second professional match and reveals her talent and grace to the world but when the williams family decides to hold out for a better sneaker deal nine months later we read on screen at the end of the movie venus signed a contract with reebok for twelve million dollars i dont mind being nudged to cry as the williams sisters reach for the stars in compton but i call out when i am asked to weep with joy over their first professional product endorsement i did not quite get why the theater director protagonist hidetoshi nishijima in drive my car was not allowed by the theater company to drive himself to work every day the idea that it would have been an insurance liability seemed odd in any case his 1987 red saab 900 becomes essential to hamaguchis film and without it the rehearsals of uncle vanya that make up much of the rest of the drama would have been stifling not that the film is necessarily opened up by the driving since a lot of that is interior a man inside a car listening to the voice of his dead wife reika kirishima on tape while another woman tōko miura drives him around cars attained a strange new level of prominence in movies in 2021 an indicator of our changing relationship to the automotive as cars helped destroy the planet became unaffordable as the pandemic continued and sometimes burned and sank into the ocean i dont mean in f9 the latest fast  furious movie in which a car travels into outer space driven by tyrese gibson and ludacris f9 a truly stupid movie wastes resources just burns through them to make money and part of its stupidity is that it makes room for helen mirren and cardi b before explicitly comparing the idea of family to a 1970 dodge charger thats not it vin not at all but it is not too far off from julia ducournaus staggering titane a french film in which a woman agathe rousselle has sex with a cadillac baby you can fuck my car gets pregnant and gives birth to a hybrid as in spencer and france these films explored womens relationships with their automobiles putting them in the drivers seat instead of men titane took this to an extreme that was maybe too much for carcentric north american viewers it didnt meet with the same outrage as david cronenbergs 1996 adaptation of j g ballards crash only because it came out during the pandemic and the few people who saw it were rendered speechless it was my favorite film of last year cars develop consciousness in these films the way the voice of the wife returned speaking through the saabs tape player in drive my car pointed in that directionthe direction of getting over grief and loss as we try to return to life it is a trend that began in art films with the talking limos in the garage at night that ended leos caraxs holy motors in 2012 in the recent king car an underseen brazilian movie that is almost as good as bacurau and has a lot in common with titane director renata pinheiro creates a revolutionary situation in pernambuco prompted by a talking car in a junkyard sex with vehicles ensues from this evolution there is no return king car explains through intercourse with machines in this contaminated environment we discover our true values its where we face our ghosts these three films are the products of different cultures with different film traditions but there is a direct line connecting the ghosts in each car accidents were way up in the us last year college students strapped for cash began living in their cars inside university parking garages and reality tv shows staged deadly airborne car stunts a show at the museum of modern art called automania put cars on display like in a showroom parked safely away from the road it was evident on movie screens however that the evolution of the automobile as a sexy dangerous vehicle continues in new directions and they are not driverless ones cars exert a different kind of control than that and have a tight hold on us driving mankind the inreverse outofgas moving truck scene in paul thomas andersons licorice pizza approaches driving from the opposite direction its an antichase that glides backwards without a roar alana haim guides the truck expertly younger men nattering at her threatening to choke her the film becomes obsessed with the 1973 oil crisis which is maybe why its so frenetic and highenergy characters are in motion and runninghaim runs so much in the film that it becomes like a parody of the worst person in the world the adult men in licorice pizza are automotive maniacs poor players strutting their hour in the movie actors and directors playing actors and directors defined by nostalgia for 1970s california licorice pizza is to 2021 what american graffiti was to 1973 but from the other side of the mirror andersons 1970s beats george lucass 1950s because anderson is expressing a minority opinion not celebrating a majority culture american graffiti existed as something it knew everyone who saw it would agree on licorice pizza turns the camera around and speaks to the few thus everything is backwards and wrong in licorice pizza as it was in the 1970s when compared to now children raise themselves adults date teens teens start businesses restaurants alienate customers and getting work is an audition for something else with hidden sexual motivations barely under the surface erupting as stupid jokes it is impossible to know whether things are based on skill or luck as the world slips backwards into the future everything is temporary and can be snuffed in an instant like the waterbed sales that reverse supply and demand overnight the effect is that licorice pizza can never be central to the culture it is part of that is its strength it exists on the edge of hollywood and is written in the margins of the film industry adjacent to it with an address in the valley this movie seems like a transitional film for anderson a stopgap like so many things that emerged during the pandemic and like the pandemic it goes on too long but time flies the melodrama in pedro almodóvars latest film is deceptively muted though the films plot is brazenly manipulative the director of all about my mother makes it easy to guess how this story of thwarted motherhood will unfold as soon as janis penélope cruz and ana milena smit both pregnant end up in the same hospital room this concentration on the presentday mechanics of the plot buries the films parallel story about mass killings in fascist spain in the 1930s under franco parallel mothers is a film of corpses and skeletons as much as it is about babies and children almodóvar leads the viewer to an excavation the same way janis leads ana to understand the history of her country unlike the story of what happened at the hospital it should not come as a surprise to her almodóvar has always dug up whatever is buried in the subconscious of his characters as they fall into comas we find they have been raised in caves or that their family history is hidden below the surface in a mass grave from film to film his characters psychological states come more and more to resemble the political history of spain at the same time his filmmaking like penélope cruz does not age he seems more contemporary the more he becomes an outlier to the mainstream of commercial cinema billy wilder told almodóvar there was one thing he should never do and that was to give in to the temptation to make a film in hollywood almodóvar has made twentytwo films since his first in 1980 and now we learn he is on the verge of making his first feature in english with cate blanchett either it is time for him to show us how its done or this is a bad idea over forty years weve learned from his films that things usually dont go so well but its foolish not to be optimistic as things fall apart at least they can look great that is a lesson maggie gyllenhaal did not keep in mind as she adapted elena ferrantes novel the lost daughter for the big screen netflix in almodóvars julieta two actresses played the same woman twenty or so years apart as olivia colman and jessie buckley do here where almodóvar dressed his seaside tale in 1980s new wave colors and hitchcockian ambiance gyllenhaals beach melodrama is a new kind of arthouse film for home viewing in which seriousness of intent must be signaled at all times through flashbacks gyllenhaal makes the bizarre or mysterious elements of the film too clear right up to the end when everything goes haywire in the opposite direction and it becomes hard to understand whats happening colman phones her daughter and bleeds into the tide with an orange in her hand a stew of symbols assembled from previous scenes  the problem is the flashbacks we see buckley as the young colman an english professor and a harried mother and wife embarking on an affair with a colleague who is supposed to be brilliant played by peter sarsgaard to resemble lateperiod michael stipe this sensitive bearded academic cracks jokes about pierre bourdieu and paul ricœur a first for netflix it is therefore obvious in a second why the middleaged colman feels such guilt for abandoning her family still discombobulated years later she vacations in greece next to a sketchy semimafia family like the one that lives across the street from me she finds herself dancing to livin on a prayer by night and translating dante into english by day two strange activities we didnt expect from her or anyone this year the film follows the chekhov gun rule but with a hatpin colman gives to shady unstable dakota johnson it was only a matter of time before johnson returned it  the movies force us to ask questions seeing the eyes of tammy faye right after nightmare alley prompted a brain teaser since the two films share a scene would you rather see jessica chastain give andrew garfield a hand job in a bathtub or see toni collette do the same to bradley cooper that was the oldtimey conwoman convincer move as far as hollywood was concerned last year  guillermo del toros remake of nightmare alley corrupts an evil story william lindsay greshams terrifying and singular 1946 novel was itself a tale of corruption and the great sui generis work of hardboiled american fiction its plot did not need to be tampered with but del toro and kim morgans screenplay cheapens something that purposefully dealt in tawdriness since this film comes close to being del toros best it is too bad he had to throw out the penultimate sections of the book i mark it down to his essential torturers mentality his flaw as a screenwriterdirectorproducer it that he thinks of himself as a great liberal and friend of the common man but he cant not revel in the infliction of pain and suffering on his villains so instead of just making the millionaire industrialist grindle richard jenkins a vindictive and deluded mark for coopers fake mentalist stan del toro has to turn grindle into a serial killer who must be beaten to death and then have grindles bodyguard holt mccallany run over by a car in graphic detail in greshams novel grindle becomes stans javert the figure who hunts him turning him into a drunk a hobo and finally the thing he most fears becoming a carnival circus geek here i must indulge in psychoanalysis like cate blanchetts character does in the movie in fact i suspect on some level del toro wants the viewer to i put his cruelty down to his subconscious identification with grindle more than stan at some level del toro recognizes himself in this wealthy sociopath an aspect of his personality he wants to punish and kill harshly there is no mercy there that kind of unnecessary cruelty continues to mar his serious work as it did in the shape of water otherwise del toros nightmare alley is a model of atmosphere and production design with beautiful committed performances from character actors who were given great roles most of all collette jenkins mccallany david strathairn willem dafoe mary steenburgen and tim blake nelson though if nelson and dafoe had swapped roles the film would have ended with an extra dash of evil turning it more hardboiled and more detouresque a tale of fate more than gore with the menacing dafoe as the guy doing stan the worst favor at the end and nelson the creep who got him into it in the first place the balance would have tilted in the direction of eternity or at least hell where del toro thrives poking away with his pitchfork in all the film industry talk about how nightmare alley and steven spielbergs new version of west side story underperformed at the box office and how that proves audiences are uninterested in seeing nonfranchise films by highend directors in theaters no one seems to have considered that both remakes are period pieces and that the original films when they came out were not they took place in the present of the time they were made so maybe it is something else the audience has rejected cigarettes aside spielbergs film is marvelous an improvement on robert wises 1961 film version of the bernsteinsondheim musical that one was distinguished by daniel fapps stunning tashlinesque color cinematography as much as by the music unfortunately there was not much fapp could do with the brownface the actors playing the sharks and their girls were forced to wear by the producers  though it is better than that and maybe spielbergs second or third best movie it nonetheless feels academic somehow the large cast a jobs program for theater kids the gentrification theme something i dont believe spielberg cares about in the least or has any experience with tony kushners rewrite of arthur laurentss original book for the show is quite convincing however as spielberg goes bravura immediately with a kaneesque crane shot computerized through the ruins of the neighborhood that became lincoln center this shot links the opening to so much in spielbergs previous work it is a set piece from a war film reminiscent of saving private ryan schindlers list and of course lincoln since a sign enters the frame that says lincoln in huge letters once again all history is the same to spielberg a teenage gang war in manhattan the equivalent of world war ii 1961 the same as 1941  doing midcentury modern and crime jazz spielberg remains obvious after an astonishing overhead shot of mounds of salt in a municipal salt shed as gang members approach in shadows from both sides spielberg has to have one of the gang members shout its salt for when the streets ice up because after all these years he still thinks his audience is not the brightest and all the world is the mass audience to him as the song tonight has it in the movie the world was just an address a lyric that never sounded so fatalistic to me until i heard it in a spielberg movie in 2022 with the wealth gap widening and pushing all but the richest people out of this city spielberg moves gee officer krupke indoors to a police station waiting room which works better and makes more sense than the nighttime storefront in wises film more importantly every decision spielberg has made to open the film into the city streets works magnificently in this lastgasp movie of joyous urban life all of it perfectly executed and choreographed with great verve and beauty his maria rachel zegler is more soulful than natalie wood was in the earlier film with her barbara steele or soledad miranda looks she fits into this film without a happy ending adding to the sense that things will not work out that the lovers are doomed along with the freedom their access to the city promised there was always a bit of 1960s horror in this operatic tragedy then it was the predictive horror of youth in revolt somehow the director of jaws found it on location in some small way like he did in marthas vineyard half a lifetime ago he gives in to it there is no future for these lovers no way to fight against what is happening to them and their neighborhood jonathan larsons life was tragic cut short by an aortic dissection in 1996 just as his musical rent was about to open to great success on broadway hed written tick tick    boom in 1991 but it was only performed twice in his lifetime now linmanuel miranda has turned this autobiographical musical into a netflix movie starring andrew garfield as larson as in coda we hear happy birthday performed because these films are about the birth of artists in their quest for musical theater acclaim both films have a desperate fleeing quality which posits that seeking artistic success is difficult and punishing too hard on others around you and a race against time in the hands of miranda and garfield this becomes a form of desperation in which every song is forced out as a lastditch effort near the end when michael robin de jesus larsons best friend and roommate discovers he has aids and sings on the verge of tears is this real life the answer is yeah but no thats because show biz dreams swamp social reality every time even in scenes that pit them against each other part of larsons story is that in the late 80s he wrote an elaborate scifi musical called superbia that was excellent but too complex to be staged in mirandas movie we see a barebones preview of it performed for critics investors and stephen sondheim bradley whitford in the context of 2021 and netflix larsongarfields description of superbia in this performance takes on an added resonance superbia he explains is a satire set in the future on a poisoned planet earth where the vast majority of humanity spend their entire lives just staring at the screens of their media transmitters watching the tiny elite of the rich and powerful who film their own fabulous lives like tv shows including this can be read as either a pitch for netflix to make another larson movie or an example of how capitalism and spectacle absorb everything rest assured however that if netflix did make it they would probably hire ben wheatley to direct it which would prevent anyone from enjoying and absorbing it what we have here is the kind of movie andré bazin called a superwestern which is a western that would be ashamed to be just itself and looks for some additional interest to justify its existencean aesthetic sociological moral psychological political or erotic interest in short some quality extrinsic to the genre and which is supposed to enrich it doubly true in this case because in jane campions power of the dog her lead character benedict cumberbatch the ruthless cowboy with the nonruthless name phil is exactly thatashamed to be just himself phil is a repressed gay man in a macho profession needling his weaker brother jesse plemons who has married a woman kirsten dunst phil considers a slattern dunsts greenhorn son kodi smitmcphee notices this and contrives to eliminate phil from the ranch here its the opposite of the situation in the superwestern shane 1953 instead of shane come back my mother wants you its phil go away my mother doesnt want you as a netflix art film a perfect breeding ground for a movie like this it is also superserious like the lost daughter similarly the films ambition leads to confusion again the ending is murky a lasso soaked in anthrax is something new in a western it has to be admitted but getting to that point was a slog a slow crawl to the oscars in a nonsuperwestern somebody on the ranch would have smacked phil in the mouth in the first scene though he is threatening and meaneyed he is no liberty valance and his needling of the other characters is intolerable and obvious the way he keeps talking about bronco henry his absent mentor who we are led to believe was also his lover is repetitive and tiresome on the ranch it would have become a source of humor phils banjo duel with dunsts poor piano playing in fact is more like something from blazing saddles than unforgiven most damningly for this film that is so subtly concerned with right and wrong campions use of new zealand in place of montana and a british actor for a ranch boss is the moral equivalent of computergenerated imagery that brings it back to bazin where it should end ultimately campions portrait of a repressed cowboy i think flatters hollywood varmints like phil may or may not have tamed the west but for sure they continued on to los angeles to found talent agencies and direct superhero movies joel coens blackandwhite film of the scottish play is not made for an age when the tv remote and the smartphone are pointed toward your hand more like a silent movie by lang or dreyer this apple tv production overwhelms shakespeare with monolithic sets powerful compositions and piercing cries frances mcdormand as lady m and denzel washington in the title role struggle to keep up with the miseenscène while kathryn hunter an amazing actor i do not remember seeing before plays all three witches and the old man in tourdeforce performances that minimize digital trickery but still get lost in coens frames it was inevitable that this version would be compared to orson welless his cheapo 1948 macbeth for republic studios is better because it isnt as distant as coens despite being seventythree years older but its more awesome with more cold terror and high drama welles goes for it as usual while coens film is something of an exercise as for being the first film from a brother act minus one even with shakespeare writing the screenplay this movie certifies ethans value when the best

Mar 28 2022,positive, warner bros and denis villenueve both have a lot riding on dune the latest stab at adapting frank herberts seminal novel for the big screen the last time the epic scifi was made into a movie it flopped hard at the box office as did villenueves blade runner 2049 the filmmakers most recent attempt at reinventing a decadesold classic for modern audiences the fact dunes title card has a part one prefix signals right from the beginning that the director has no intention of telling a complete story which is the single greatest and most glaring weakness of a film packed toptobottom with strengths of course nobody knew that the pandemic would come along and decimate the entire entertainment industry but its a bold and downright risky move opting to spend 165 million on a starstudded blockbuster that doesnt have an ending dune has been called unfilmable on plenty of occasions and youll likely be less than ten minutes into the 155minute running time before you decide whether or not the story is going to be up your street opening any film with a voiceover that delivers exhausting exposition is a gambit but the incredible visual style on display from the very first frame offsets the dry info dumps about arrakis spice the houses of harkonnen and atreides fremen and all the rest make no mistake about it dune is a dense complex and incredibly ambitious slice of hollywood spectacle one that might not be for everyone however if you immerse yourself into the richlydetailed world and allow the sheer scope of this thing to wash over you the end result is comfortably one of the most distinctive and unique studiobacked titles to come along in a long time trying to condense the plot of dune is a fools errand but in the broadest of strokes its a classic heros journey right out of the joseph campbell playbook timothee chalamets paul atreides is the son of oscar isaacs duke leto and theyve just been appointed by the imperium empire to assume command of operations on arrakis paul has continuous dreams that may be prophetic in nature with zendayas fremen chani a recurring figure in all of them as it turns out the house of atreides has been lured into a planetary ambush by the harkonnen forcing paul and his mother lady jessica to flee into the desert all while the young man wrestles with the destiny of being muaddib essentially the chosen one of the fremen if that doesnt sound like your bag then theres really no point in watching dune at all because huge swathes of the narrative are dedicated to characters talking about political machinations prophecies doublecrosses disbelievers and the like on a technical level though dune is never anything less than spectacular and often outright astounding villenueve is one of the best visualists in the business and when you marry that to greig frasers stunning cinematography and an understated yet still sweeping hans zimmer score its always a feast for the eyes and ears early comparisons to lord of the rings harry potter and star wars sounded lofty but theyre not entirely accurate either dune is a much different type of movie and while it shares plenty of dna with those aforementioned classics in terms of expanding its mythology and laying the groundwork for whats to come villenueve isnt so much interested in action sequences or a stirring sense of adventure as he is in treating everything with the utmost seriousness solemnity and thematic weight luckily the cast are about as uniformly excellent as youd imagine given their pedigree chalamet makes for a wellrounded protagonist even if he does flirt with bratty territory once or twice with isaac and josh brolin furrowing their brows and letting their gruff charisma shine stellan skarsgard and dave bautista do veer a little into the onedimensional side of things which will likely be rectified should we get that dune part two with jason momoa providing the only real levity and lightness of touch as duncan idaho regularly popping up to steal scenes thanks to his easygoing natural charisma another issue with dune is the pacing its a long movie that very much feels like a long movie at points but at least its frequently punctuated by grandstanding scenes of great actors doing great acting intricatelychoreographed fight sequences or some classic cgi destruction on an intergalactic scale as an experience its unlike anything else youll see this year and villenueve wasnt lying when he said you wont get anything close to the best of dune if you watch it at home circling back to this beginning of this review just to reiterate that a lot of people are going to find the ending of dune infuriating for two and a half hours villenueves aweinspiring effort has been building towards paul finally meeting chani and becoming the man he was always destined to be and then it ends calling a movie part one is fine if part two is already guaranteed to happen but warner bros have made it clear that finishing the story is entirely dependent on how the first half fares at the box office if the numbers arent up to scratch then dune will always have an asterisk next to its name as 50 of what it wanted to be so lets hope that audiences turn up in their droves to see it this weekend

Mar 23 2022,positive, the desire to acknowledge mainstream movies alongside typical oscar fare isnt a new development from the dark knights best picture snub inspiring a rule change to the nearly implemented popular film award the academy wants the best of both worlds but the focus on the fanvoted awards and the hype that surrounded no way home potentially sneaking into this years best picture race have ignored the giant sandworm in the room theres already an epic immersive crowdpleasing tentpole up for 10 oscars including best picture and dune doesnt just deserve a seat at the table an ambitious spectacle with a level of craftsmanship comparable to the lord of the rings trilogy and mad max fury road dune winning best picture is exactly what the academy needs a blockbuster celebrating the inimitable aweinspiring power of the big screen that everyone can get behind  the critical and commercial success of dune was hardly a sure thing celebrated auteurs have twice tried to make a movie out of frank herberts seminal scifi novel the first attempt from alejandro jodorowsky was never completedthough its failure was turned into a documentarywhile david lynch disavowed his fascinatingly flawed adaptation that made it to the screen but these highprofile setbacks didnt deter denis villeneuve whose impressive cv of bigbudget genre filmmaking includes a worthy sumptuous sequel to blade runner if someone was going to crack the code to dune villeneuve seemed a good bet  villeneuves solution was to split dune into two films a move that would give the political machinations of herberts dense sprawling text more time to breathe that villeneuve made this decision without the guarantee of a sequel was quite the flex but dune part deux was put in an even more precarious position when the pandemic arrived and warnermedia controversially elected to have all its 2021 theatrical releases simultaneously available to stream on hbo max villeneuve voiced his frustrations with the company in a scathing variety oped in which he extolled the virtues of the theatrical experience and how essential it was for dune but reading between the lines of his column you could also sense the palpable anxiety that a halfcompleted dune would become one of cinemas greatest whatifs a whatif that was partially selfinflicted no less of course theres no longer any concern about the franchises future the sequel is happening and the fact that warner bros and legendary pictures made the announcement within days of dunes release spoke volumes of villeneuve backing up his big talk with a very big movie  dune made an impression before a single frame was even shown on screen as the discordant sounds of the sardaukartheir garbled words translating to dreams are messages from the deepset the tone for a jarring transportive experience in an era of cinematic universes that pander to audiences with familiarity theres a lot to admire about villeneuves confidence in his own uncompromising visionand that viewers will go along for the ride it helps that the special effects spared no expense the sandworms are as unfathomably enormous as advertised underlining that despite the expanse of barren desert on arrakis the planet is very much alive the deadofnight siege perpetrated by house harkonnen against house atreides was laced with apocalyptic dread as hulking ships descended from the pitchblack sky to raze everything in their wake throw in hans zimmers booming oscarnominated score which in certain theaters rattles your seat like a plane going through turbulence and you can understand why villeneuve was so insistent that dune had to be seen on the big screen  dune winning best picture wont save theaters and it probably wont halt the oscars ratings slide but in adapting one of science fictions most iconicand notoriously unadaptablenovels into a blockbuster with artistry gravitas and a battalion of movie stars to bring it to life villeneuve has created something special dune is an antidote to stale familiar franchises and a breathtaking reminder of why we love movies the way theyre meant to be seen with the academy fretting about the waning popularity of its award show and an industry continuing to reckon with the evershifting tides of the pandemic the oscars can do much worse than embracing desert power  rachel and callie discuss the bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes then jodi hops on to talk the valley and vanderpump rules
Mar 13 2022,positive, whatever your entertainment needs we got your back and hopefully your mind with queertys weekly culture club column with some of the highlights of new releases streaming shows classics worth revisiting and what to drink while you watch if lawrence of arabia director david lean ever made a scifi movie it would probably look a lot like dune possibly the most ambitious genre movie since lord of the rings director denis villeneuve cements his place as one of the rising auteurs with his adaption of frank herberts classic novel about commerce and political machinations in the year 10191 the sprawling cast list and labyrinthine plot arent easy to condense though the basic gist is thus in the future mankind has colonized a huge portion of the universe using a chemical spice as a means of space travel said spice is only found on one planet and two ruling clans vie for control the brutal harkonnen led by a sociopathic baron stellan skarsgård and the egalitarian atreides led by duke leto oscar isaac amid the conflict letos son paul timothée chalamet begins to experience prophetic visions suggesting he could be a longprophesied superbeing if nothing else dune wins its place as a masterpiece of adaptation truncating roughly half the novel into its runtime to expand the books monomaniacal focus on paul into a more ensemble narrative villeneuve also updates some of the novels dated elements racially and genderdiversifying the cast and eliminating the books homophobia herberts novel portrays the baron as an incidental homosexualsomething the 1984 film version by david lynch radically ampedup seriouslyits one of the most homophobic movies ever made folks here villeneuve keeps the barons sexuality subtle but evident chalamet again proves himself one of the best actors of his generation in the lead while supporting players david dastmalchian as a creepy human calculator called a mentat and sharon duncanbrewster as a native paleontologist almost steal the movie outright with a visual style that resembles a national geographic from the distant futurebrightlylit images that look totally real even when cgias well as scenes of chalamet and isaac scantily clad we recommend seeing dune in imax wherever possible the movie is an epic reminder of how magical the cinematic experience can be and one of the best films of the year director rachel boynton examines american polarization over politics and racial history in this excellent new documentary in civil war boynton travels across the country examining how opinionsand indeed teaching historyof the civil war and racism vary by geography in the south schools tend to teach that slavery and racism had little to do with the war itself which they say was started by northern states wishing to subjugate the south forget that whole bit about the south seceding from the union but nevermind residents there meanwhile romanticize the confederacy as a sort of utopia undone by federal government overreach contrast that with the north where states do teach that the war resulted from disputes over slavery but dont always address the issues of systemic racism and bias that still affect africanamericans to this day it would be easy to dismiss civil war as a work trying to shame the south and nationwide white complacency but boyntons camera paints a far more complicated picture in a masterstroke the director opts to interview school children of varied ages and races to discuss their own impressions of the civil war and racism in america that leads to some very moving passages of personal testimony furthermore civil war argues that our current age of alternative facts fox news and oan has much older roots dating from reconstruction the union might have won the war and slavery might have been abolished but the south won the aftermath finding ways to continue to subjugate africanamericans and keep the racist spirit of the confederacy alive its a mustsee for anyone concerned over racial justice in the united states today and anyone wondering how politics have become so polarized queer actor misha osherovich leads this new young adult horror series about three teenagers battling a mysterious cult and monsters from another dimension the series follows a group of teenagers in a small town in the pacific northwest carrie stefanie scott escapes a supernatural cult that has held her captive most of her life and joins forces with nolan osherovich and tasha sofia bryant to elude arthur will yun lee a fellow cult member tasked with capturing carrie yet as the three engage in a dangerous game of catandmouse malevolent spirits begin to plague the town threatening to destroy everyone and everything fans of buffy the vampire slayerstyle horror and occultism will have a ball watching girl in the woods for queer viewers the show also offers a good deal of empathy fleshing out nolans story of questioning gender and sexuality as well as enduring homophobic harassment indeed as played by osherovich nolan feels the most fleshedout of all the characters and histheir storyline also has the most emotional resonance besides its a lot of fun to see a queer character on a monsterslaying adventure ridiculous if touching we give the series our recommendation for osherovichs performance and nolans storyline director daniel sánchez lópezs festival favorite arrives on streaming this week inviting viewers to indulge in its meditations on male on male love boy meets boy follows harry matthew james morrison a hardpartying londoner about to leave berlin to return home two days before his departure he meets johannes alexandros koutsoulis another handsome man that offers to help him print his boarding pass the two begin a wandering journey together in search of a printer and along the way explore their mutual attraction marketing materials for boy meets boy market it as a sort of queer answer to before sunrise and in general we agree with that assessment the entire movie hinges on the chemistry between morrison and koutsoulis and the two establish a very strong erotic rapport with one another on the other hand the story itself has very little in the way of actionmost scenes consist of harry and johannes engaging in long conversations about love sex and queer life that makes for a talky movie in general though we did find lópezs dialogue both sharp and astute boy meets boy doesnt exactly break new ground as cinema though it does feature a sincere romantic story and hint that lópez morrison and koutsoulis all have bright careers ahead give the film a watchwe think youll agree the world of legitimate theatre returns at last and this touring company of the classic lerner  lowe musical welcomes lgbtq audiences this week with a special reception for the uninitiated my fair lady adapts queer playwright george bernard shaws play pygmalion as a musical lowclass flower seller eliza doolittle dreams of one day living a

develop a complicated friendship as they set about passing eliza off as royaltyand discovering that men and women neednt be lovers to have a relationship ok were going on record now by saying contrary to conventional opinion there is zero romance between eliza and higgins george bernard shaw would agree with us and wrote several essays explaining why chief among our reasons and one implied by shaw higgins is actually gay and while eliza may protest that he doesnt treat her like a lady she comes to see his larger point he wants to treat her as an equal keep that rumination in mind while watching this lush new production directed by barlett sher who originally helmed it as a 2018 broadway revival queer audience members should also take note of a special reception this week held at the nearby

listen to the same kind of ridiculous vitriol from straight people our whole lives queer recording artist ryals drops his new album this week a song cycle inspired by loss of a parent navigating a foreign society and enduring a life of homophobia far from the downbeat tunes the subject matter would imply ryals has composed an energized and sassy compilation of synthpop electronica and sexy

you support our mission with a contribution today hi im apparently the antiwikidbstn im very much into the scifi or fantasymythology genres but lord of the rings left me feeling meh and dune was the very first book i ever couldnt finish i hope you get your wish for the movie its always nice when a childhood favorite book becomes an internationally popular movie the south could certainly use more shaming and white complacency in america really cant be touched on enough but thank goodness theres a touching part to comfort the viewer  are high higgins isnt the least bit concerned about doolittles goal she is but an experiment to him he recognizes his work will help her perhaps get a job in a flower shop but that is a meaningless side effect of his plan to show off how great a teacher he can be civil war sounds like it could be an important documentary but i doubt the people who most need to see it will millionsmostamericans still think lincolns emancipation proclamation effective january 1 1863 ended slavery even though it was the union army which included hundreds of thousands of black soldiers that defeated the confederacy decisively in 1865 to end slavery de facto and the 13th amendment passed by congress and ratified by 27 of 38 us states in december 1865 that ended chattel slavery de jure the us did not even publicly commemorate the 150th anniversary of the end of this momentous war the most violent and deadly on us soil which suggests how unresolved the issues it represented still are
Mar 10 2022,positive, there are waves in the sand and theyre moving your mind is not playing tricks on you though the thought might pop into your head while youre immersed in the engulfing landscapes of dune denis villeneuves transporting richly textured adaptation of frank herberts seminal 1965 scifi novel about political intrigue what it means to be a leader and things that go bump in the sand any concerns this reviewer might have had about the sicario auteurs ability to tackle the source materials dense and complex meditation on lust for power and violent backstabbings were promptly allayed by the confident mise en scene and effortless worldbuilding it bears the french canadian directors trademark gravity but not in a way that it becomes overbearing or numbing as it sometimes has been there are even moments of levity could this possibly be the same storyteller known for his pessimistic worldview believe it the 54yearold filmmaker reportedly wanted to make a piece of pop entertainment that both cinephiles and joe moviegoer could dig mission accomplished at least for now lets call this massive movie ride by its original and more honest title dune part one villeneuve working from a screenplay credited to him jon spaihts and eric roth has opted to cover roughly the first half of the book delivering a final cut that clocks in at 155 minutes it feels just right to this scifi nerd but more on that later theres an inevitable sense of déjà vu that comes with seeing the story of young gifted troubled paul atreides timothée chalamet and the baptism by fire that might just make a leader out of him after all david lynch had a go at it in the 1980s while the results there were far messier and more erratic i still have a soft spot for his gaudy vision blame kyle maclachlans pisces energy and stings scenery chewing temptation was purposely resisted to revisit the 1984 film prior to seeing the 2021 production whats most striking about villeneuves more reinedin reimagining is that despite the distant future setting and all the thrillingly rendered technology that goes with it this dune feels thoroughly oldfashioned it often plays like an early cinemascope swordandsandal epic in space opera drag theres no attempt to roid things up to appeal to a younger demographic this filmmaking team has astutely intuited that if you assemble this machine right people will be drawn in regardless of aesthetic preferences you wont need a glossary to guide you along everything is laid out with the kind of clarity that is too often taken for granted pauls dad duke leto atreides oscar isaac rocking some mighty facial hair accepts the stewardship of arrakis a desert planet known as a sparsely populated wasteland it is also the source of the spice a photogenic grain with manifold qualities including making space navigation possible the drug also enhances mental abilities in a way that makes realworld hallucinogens feel like tylenol a family of noble lineage with plenty of enemies is tasked with overseeing the celestial body that houses the most coveted substance in this interplanetary empire what could possibly go wrong    photographer  jason momoa in a scene from dune photo credit courtesy of warner bros pictures and legendary pictures copyright  2020 warner bros entertainment inc  the film alternates between scenes showing paul withdrawn brooding haunted by visions that look uncannily like arrakis  interacting with his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson his devoted father and those in their immediate orbit and those that introduce us to the miscreants plotting to swoop in and ruin the atreides clans ambitious plans that would be baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård bearing a possibly coincidental resemblance to a certain political figure and his nephew beast rabban harkonnen dave bautista thrown into the mix is reverend mother mohiam a shrewdly cast charlotte rampling member of an exclusive sisterhood trained to hone abilities that some look down upon as witchcraft but whose gift for backdoor wheeling and dealing can turn the tide in the minefield that the atreides family is about to enter mohiam still miffed at jessica for reasons revolving around paul and leto is unsure as to how paul fits into her plans in a squirminducing scene she tests his ability to withstand pain    photographer  stellan skarsgard in a scene from dune photo credit courtesy of warner bros pictures and legendary pictures copyright  2020 warner bros entertainment inc  leto has big plans for his son as does his mother but as the attractive household leaves their oceanrich planet for the arid sands of arrakis it becomes clear paul might be destined for even greater things the iconography in the desert planet with its tribal culture and territorial disputes brings to mind the arab world both during the time of te lawrence and its contemporary unrest add the way paul is regarded by the native residents or fremen as a messianic figure who would fulfill a prophecy and that could make some viewers look at chalamets scrawny aristocrat as a white savior but its clear villeneuve aims to highlight the characters insecurity his trepidation that he might fall short of the duties that will be asked of him when the other shoe drops narrativewise theres a controlled grandeur to the chaos there are few surprises from a storytelling viewpoint but its all executed with such airtight precision that we cant help but be swept along theres an adolescent earnestness that coupled with the prowess behind the camera results in a viewing experience that is at once comforting and oddly endearing also those sandworms are about as spectacular as promised man theyre big kudos to cinematographer greig fraser and production designer patrice vermette for sustaining a chiaroscuro look that makes every surface so tactile this is scifi made with chops and conviction and as such it never comes across as filmmaking by committee the way other franchises frequently do    photographer  timothée chalamet in a scene from dune photo credit courtesy of warner bros pictures and legendary pictures copyright  2020 warner bros entertainment inc  mature yet juvenile otherworldly yet pleasingly familiar dune demands to be experienced on the biggest screen you can find sandworms yes im aware its on hbo max for a limited time but if you have resumed going to the theaters take the plunge after all personal filmmaking on such a massive scale only comes across once in a blue moon isnt that so peter jackson that big fat grin i had plastered on my face never faded denis villeneuves dune is now playing in wide release including imax engagements at amc aventura mall amc sunset place regal cinemas south beach and the granddaddy of them all autonation imax at the museum of discovery and science in fort lauderdale it is also available to stream on hbo max for the next 30 days but its so much better on the big screen

Mar 10 2022,positive, when you read a lot of genre fiction or even regular literary fiction that leans toward the complex you hear the word unadaptable a lot tons of stephen king books are unadaptable thomas pynchon is unadaptable house of leaves is unadaptable for decades frank herberts audacious science fiction masterwork dune was considered unadaptable and then in 1984 david lynchs attempt proved that to be more or less true its so dense and there is just so much detail to get across to your audience even in the background exposition before you get to the actual narrative nevertheless its one of those books that is so beloved and influential its always in the back of hollywoods mind waiting to be put to screen once again denis villeneuve having proven himself with his oscarnominated arrival and improbably fantastic blade runner sequel was handed the reins to take another shot at it this time separating the story into two partsthe first of which comes out october 22 in theaters and on hbo max dune technically titled dune part one introduces a universe ruled by a substance so precious noble families wage war upon each other to gain control of it until one family realizes the true scope of the wealth buried beneath the sands of one desert planet it feels like the movie that fans of the novel have been waiting for everyone elses mileage may vary the year is 10191 and humanity is ruled by a planetary imperium that tracks and manipulates the relationships between the noble houses shifting families back and forth according to the emperors whims the favor now seems to land on house atreides who has been gifted control and residency of the planet arrakis also known as dune covered as it is with desert from pole to pole dune is the home of spice a substance that allows the members of the spacing guild who take it as a drug to jump through space transporting people and materials all around the galaxy whoever controls spice production on arrakis will become very rich indeed but the atreides family and their vassals need to tread lightly the gift of arrakis is definitely a test and likely a trap overseen by the atreides powerful enemies the brutish house harkonnen duke leto atreides oscar isaac and his family bene gesserit an order of genealogyobsessed sorceresses concubine lady jessica rebecca ferguson and their fey son paul timothée chalamet arrive on the planet ready to ally themselves with the blueeyed fremen the native human population who have developed ways of surviving in the wasteland building stillsuits that recycle the bodys water and walking in odd ways so as not to attract the attention of the giant sandworms that swim beneath the deserts surface plaguing spice mining equipment and swallowing anything in their path before they can accomplish much baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård and his forces led by the sadistic beast rabban dave bautista wreak havoc changing the course of the atreides familys fortunes what they dont count on is the hidden power of the atreides son paul who has a connection to the fremen deeper than any of them suspect as you can probably tell by the two whole paragraphs of plot description dune is complex and again this is only the first part setting up the exposition needed to understand whats going on and then cutting off about halfway through the novel as warner bros prefers to wait to see how this movie does before allowing villeneuve to film part two whats impressive about this movie is how straightforwardly it sets up everything you need to know giving plenty of context to bizarre phrases like kwisatz haderach and gom jabbar so that anyone paying attention can pretty competently follow whats going on it also has plenty of room for long involved conversations between characters using the space efficiently to introduce nuanced relationships between themduring a ceremonial meeting duke leto mutters to his warmaster gurney halleck josh brolin to smile and halleck responds stonefaced i am smiling the friendship between paul and jovial swordmaster duncan idaho jason momoa is particularly rich villeneuve uses these interactions sparingly but they breathe life into a story that could very easily become extremely dry and dull thats whats impressive about dune to make a film this straightforward out of some of the densest material in science fiction is a feat and one that villeneuve and his actors accomplish pretty much without a hitch as long as youre paying attention youll get it conversely if you dont feel like paying attention to whats going on the movie is a true feast for the eyes and the ears thanks to some garish sound design and hans zimmers booming score building interiors are stark angular shadowed spaceships are chunky loud and tangible costumes are extravagant with voluminous flowing veils comically high headdresses and tubes poking out of every fold airships are outlined by searchlight beams cutting through thick mists miles of sand vibrate in waves as worms pass underneath dune cant really be called accessible because the novel itself isnt what wed call accessible either audiences who are predisposed to find fascination with its complex political intrigues and gibberish phrases will enjoy it those who already dont like those things likely will not and those on the fence are hard to predict the movie like the novel makes you work a little for its affections and will reward you for the effort bigger rewards will likely come in the sequel adapting the more psychedelic more outofthisworld material of the book which makes dunes current situation a dense space opera released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming more than a little precarious dune part one will leave fans not only wanting but hoping for more the spice in other words must flow
Mar 10 2022,positive, sicario  arrival  blade runner 2049  its fair to say denis villeneuve has been on a bit of a roll behind the camera   and now the frenchcanadian director has turned his hand to adapting frank herberts classic scifi novel which paved the way for star wars and many other genre favourites   unlike megafan villeneuve i am no dune aficionado having never read the book or seen david lynchs mostly derided 1984 take on the source material  get all the news from your area  as well as features entertainment sport and the latest on lanarkshires recovery from the coronavirus pandemic  straight to your fingertips 247 the free download features the latest breaking news and exclusive stories and allows you to customise your page to the sections that matter most to you given the original book is around 500 pages long and crammed with worldbuilding and lots of characters villeneuve wisely took the decision to split the story into two movies  as has come to be the way with villeneuves work dune is an exceptional looking film you quickly get swept away in the desert planet of arrakis and the sandy dusty surroundings are punctuated by cloudy blue eyes neon lasers and sunkissed skies   the scale is epic and you should see dune on as big a screen as possible with the moment the famous giant sand worms finally make their appearance counting as event cinema at its best  villeneuves cast are suitably stellar at first i was concerned chalamet might struggle to carry the weight of his key role but he grows into it masterfully  other standouts include rebecca ferguson  lady jessica  oscar isaac  duke leto  zendaya  chani  and josh brolin  gurney  while there are slender but unsettling turns from stellan skarsgård  baron harkonnen  and charlotte rampling  reverend mother mohiam   some characters are clearly set up for bigger things in the next movie and this also leads to a lack of resolution which along with a lot of dialogue that will go over nonfans heads grates at times
Mar 10 2022,positive, dense with lore and backstory that may be a touch intimidating to the uninitiated denis villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts doorstop scifi classic dune is a windswept epic in the true sense tawnytinted and forebodingly handsome in its design  dune is about a young man born to high status paul atreides timothée chalamet softspoken with a wellspring of defiance in his eyes whose family have been offered a dubious gift from their emperor a desert planet called arrakis inhabited by native people called the fremens who have been brutally oppressed by a savage race of warriors known as the harkonnens  theres real visual dynamism in the film with a strong backbone of rhythmic editing to intersperse pauls journey with oblique visions of a cloudy future the production and costume design too are austerely beautiful particularly its dragonfly warplanes and octagonal concrete palaces  chalamet is well backed by a strong supporting cast from stellan skarsgård as head of the warlike harkonnens to a heroic battlehardened soldier played by jason momoa  engrossing and frustrating in equal measure dune is the first instalment of what may prove to be a sciencefiction lord of the rings a megabudget worldbuilding fantasy on a huge scope what hampers the film most is the concept of its serialisation while its a compliment to say that i wished it would continue after over two hours it simply fizzles instead offering a halfhearted conclusion in service of setting up a sequel ultimately dune sacrifices its own momentum to cut itself in two rather than commit itself  and its audience  to following paul on his long and dangerous journey it lacks a certain faith in the viewer and thats a shame because the films ambition is admirable 
Mar 8 2022,positive, in the long history of novels being adapted into films it seems a certainly that people have always spoken of unfilmable books of course they are usually only considered unfilmable until an enterprising production team actually films them as was the case with peter jacksons widely acclaimed the lord of the rings trilogy frank herberts dune has spent a lot of time on peoples lists despite both a 1984 feature film and a 2000 tv miniseries in this case people use these adaptations as proof of their unfilmable sentiment both film and series have their own critical flaws and these seem to justify the argument that dune is simply too long too complex and too expensive to film acclaimed writerdirector denis villeneuve arrival prisoners has taken a redhot go and proving the naysayers wrong with his 2021 epic feature titled dune in all marketing materials but dune part one once the audience has paid for a ticket and started the movie not only it is a slightly dubious bit of deception it is also a key sign of how villeneuve has attempt to film the unfilmable rather than adapt herberts entire 412page novel in one shot he has split the work into two for those familiar with the plot villeneuves dune goes as far as paul meeting the fremen in the desert to see the rest of the story viewers will have to wait until late 2023 for those unfamiliar with dune it is an epic science fiction story set far into humanitys future the known universe consists of a massive empire within which rival aristocratic houses compete for the emperors favour travel between star systems requires the use of a substance called melange or spice and it is only found on the planet arrakis  more commonly known as dune the brutal house harkonnen is robbed of its control of dune with authority given by the emperor to fierce rival house atreides the harkonnens of course are not prepared to let go of their prime asset so they can help it that setup barely scratches the surface of dune of course and the main challenge facing any filmmaker is how to capture and deliver an enormous amount of worldbuilding history and political machinations into the space of a few hours there is also the extensive cast of characters whose varying allegiances goals and personalities must be established and played out david lynchs 1984 adaptation essentially tried a kitchen sink approach overloading the films first half in particular with names characters and situations piled so thick and fast that it simply became confusing villeneuve tries what is essentially the opposite approach stripping out a lot of extraneous detail and trying to both slow down the feed of information and only give the audience what they need to know at any given time the approach seems only partially successful as well as rather uneven in some cases it still feels as if too much of the novel was unnecessarily retained in others the absence of proper explanations renders some of the characters choices a little difficult to understand what is included takes twoandahalf hours to play out at what often seems to be an interminable slowness i cannot shake the feeling that with a little more trust in the audience and a more energised pace villeneuve could have captured the novel very effectively in the space of three hours as it stands this slow and methodical technique seems to show off a director afraid of their own production as if one overconfident misstep would mean ruin for the whole enterprise it is of course impeccably designed from the costumes to the enormous machinery and craft of mining spice the film presents a beautifully realised and consistent universe it lacks a variety of colour which seems a shame  everything is either grey or brown which seems as much a hallmark of postgladiator epic filmmaking as the whisperandshout delivery of the dialogue villeneuve has assembled an absolutely outstanding cast of actors to populate his dune timothée chalamet presents the precise blend of youthful naivete and inner strength than protagonist paul atreides requires oscar isaac and stellan skarsgård are fine as rival leaders of atreides and harkonnen a fine range of actors fill the various supporting parts rebecca ferguson josh brolin chang chen dave bautista charlotte rampling javier bardem zendaya and a number of others they are uniformly superb yet as with the other elements of the film they feel very carefully arranged like figures in a doll house it would be hard not to recognise an allegory of the colonial oil trade in the middle east within herberts dune the film certainly does with hans zimmers multilayered score reflecting the music of the region and the costuming the fashion the fremen  indigenous peoples of the deserts of arrakis  are simultaneously fetishised as an exotic 19th century arabia and apparently cast entirely without actors of middle eastern ethnicity it is not the best of looks neither is the films apparent embrace of the white saviour narrative  although that is more a result of splitting the story in two than anything else dune is certainly worthy  oh so worthy  and handsomely produced and should please most fans of herberts iconic novel at the same time it feels rather like a film made in fear fear of making the wrong creative choice or omitting the wrong bit of the book or even the wrong delivery of a famous line it would be a lie to claim i did not enjoy it but like lynchs previous attempt i enjoyed with some fairly major caveats to my mind both films together demonstrate that dune is far from unfilmable  but that perhaps the best film version would exist somewhere between the two it is hard to fully pass judgement of villeneuves dune by the end of 2023 we can hopefully tell for sure
Mar 7 2022,positive, one of the most anticipated films for many attending the new york film festival was without a doubt denis villeneuves dune the outlandish and artistic scifi epic will leave audiences wanting more this is definitely a good thing many will be satisfied with the product villeneuve has bred for the big screen creating a take on outer space visuals somewhat reminiscent of salvador dalí dune or dune part one as it is officially titled onscreen is an adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by frank herbert it follows a young paul atreides who might just be the chosen one finding out is part of the journey his family must travel to a hazardous planet to fulfill a duty assigned to them by the emperor they quickly come to realize that malicious work is at play as they try to harvest the planets resources only to come across various setbacks and deadly threats dune is your typical heros journey paul ventures into the unknown crossing the threshold into a world foreign to him yet familiar all the same audiences will be able to fully transport themselves to pauls reality it does a good job of helping one understand the rules of the world in a quick stride that being said it does not hold the viewer by the hand the exposition while done well might be overwhelming to some there is a lot to take in and process but once the ball gets rolling theres no stopping it the story itself is a calculated adaptation of a colonial narrative set in worlds unknown and new to us the most lengthy task at hand was to convince the audience of this worlds realism to hook them in dune succeeds at this however the grand scale splendor isnt enough to distract from the absence of villeneuves trademark emotional vulnerability  many have praised the 2017 film blade runner 2049 for balancing its cold exterior with said vulnerability at its center while dune is a nearly perfect film it exudes a hollowedout nature at times to perfect the visual spectacle the film creates emotional moments that while welltimed and fitting for the narrative often feel formulaic at the very center one cant help but think the emotional core of the film is missing at its roots its also a conflicting narrative the hero of the film partakes in the colonial siege of a foreign territory while his family suffers the consequences he is framed under the guise of empathy part one of the dune duology in short tackles the crumbling of an empire it explores loss under the ruse of conquest for honor villeneuve ventures into the politics of expansion and takeover that will ring true to many that face this reality today nevertheless the film does not go beyond that it presents the ramifications of forced subjugation leading up to the exploration of the other sides perspective in the future installment  in terms of the performances the cast was one to watch an excellent and dynamic ensemble they make the best of every scene to name a notable outlier would be difficult because one cannot excel at what theyre given without another timothée chalamet might be the exception due to the cards hes dealt as the protagonist  the mountainous weight of dune weighs down on chalamets shoulders as a result this adds to his portrayal of paul a young man with too much to take on too fast the same doubt one might cast on his ability to carry the role translates into the same doubt one might have on whether paul is prepared to step up to the challenge without a doubt they both are  while lacking the visual charisma chalamet often brings with his presence he was a mesmerizing lead clouded by conflict and turmoil it contributes to the troubled atmosphere of the story hes able to characterize the film as an exploration of a subtle loss of humanity through the sacrifice of ones empathy in the face of loss through his performance his journey will probably seem to many as the antithesis of ks own in blade runner 2049
Feb 21 2022,positive, perhaps the best or at least the most revealing thing that can be said about denis villeneuves grandly mounted adaptation of frank herberts dune is that he makes it look easy  this isnt to say any filmmaker could have shepherded the movie to life nor that this installment announcing itself as part 1 doesnt mean villeneuve has been graced with a bigger sandbox in which to convincingly create set up this sandswept saga about intergalactic rivalry and schemes which span centuries rather villeneuve makes adapting the narrative intricacies and otherworldly enormity of the source material look easy by succeeding at probably the hardest thing committing wholeheartedly to an aesthetic vision so shamelessly grand and evocative that at its best this story of young paul atreides on the desert planet arrakis feels like the story villeneuve has been quietly working towards for the better part of the last decade  in certain respects its true not for nothing has the frenchcanadian filmmaker become accustomed to making movies no one else would think to try for good reason arrival is a masterwork adapted from a short story exploring language in the pitch of arithmetic and the alluring openendedness of ridley scotts seminal blade runner practically made an unspoken rule that no sequel would be attempted villeneuve it seems enjoys breaking those rules almost as much as he ignores them altogether this is to say he so earnestly makes the case his trademark brooding brutal style is the right vehicle for this halfadaptation of dune that at a certain point you begin to wonder if villeneuve doesnt see himself in its central prophecy he as is the case with timothée chalamets paul is a lad of great expectations  that only makes us all the more vulnerable to be initially enticed and then wholly entranced by the implications of a dune adaptation which suggests the inevitability of disaster while wondering if destiny is something not to glorify but to fear the lens is wide enough to reconsider the worlds of wizards and hobbits should we choose to apply it but with villeneuve peering through dune most readily translates as a fable where the lines between losing and finding oneself are blurred against the backdrop of royal responsibility moral emptiness and yes giant sandworms whose underground gliding the visual effects team realizes here with screenshaking suspense  youll hear those beasts referred to a few times as shai hulud one of several phrases either derived or borrowed outright by herbert and this screenplay by villeneuve jon spaihts and eric roth from middle eastern vernacular as was the case in 1965 so does it remain true here that dune plays as allegory for resourcegrabbing and interimperial tensions over valuable lands only here oil becomes the ultracommodity spice and colonial powers become the houses atreides and harkonnen the former of which has been assigned to take the reins in overseeing spice production on arrakis from the latter contending evermore with the encroachment on their lands are the native fremen rebelling sometimes but mostly remaining in their isolated caverns while awaiting their emancipation meanwhile pauls position as the perhapssupernaturally inclined son of house atreides leader duke leto oscar isaac conveying a sense of regal capability is also the reason he attracts the attention of the bene gesserit a group of suspicious and strictly female stringpullers of which his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson the ensembles soulful anchor is a member  got all that because its just the start game of thrones fans might find it easier to settle into the behindthecurtains plotting which will culminate in a massive nighttime invasion but the rest of the audience can rest easy even as other faces arrive to bolster this storys rosters helped along by a bit of movieopening exposition underscoring the movies strange structure dune largely succeeds at one of its tallest tasks coherently positioning the players who fill the superbly rendered palaces the plot only partially unfolds in and establishing their various loyalties through elemental means the atreides home planet of caladan is a peaceful oasis of green and blue for instance while the harkonnens reside on a stormy orb where they prefer their decor inky and oppressive on arrakis the new abode of house atreides is a city of geometric black holes that look as though they were excavated from the dunes themselves  that those pompously massive sets designed by patrice vermette shrink into feeble sandcastles when the camera manned with the assured hand of frequent villeneuve collaborator greig fraser soars toward the vast stretches of desert surrounding them is no accident to fully appreciate the grandiosity of dune these most memorable sequences seem to suggest we must notice the smallness as wellthe way house atreides ships with their fluttering steel wings or spherical shapes shrink to the size of bugs on the screen as they approach massive sandworms the delicate and ominous framing of a fallen patriarchs hand at this first installments violent climax what villeneuve understands in bringing arrakis and the power struggle over it to cinematic life is that sheer scale is a malleable force and a viscerally overpowering one in a story nearly devoid of lightness or displays of affection the epics investment in character resides on the edges of its spectacle amid the juxtaposition of sandy mysticality and rumbling militarism on one hand villeneuves faithfulness to herberts novel extends to the rigid shallowness of this worlds denizens ones defined almost exclusively by either calculation greed unquestioning responsibility or defiance its difficult to imagine chalamet imitating the spaceopera buoyancy of mark hamills luke skywalker but dune is also no star wars which means the young star isnt trying to his hushed portrayal begins to feel more purposeful when dune shifts to arrakis and that may as well indicate how the young stars settling into the role is meant to mirror our own settling into this world  on the other hand the shallowness of motivation may very well be part of the point and part of the reason villeneuve  whose stories tend to locate a resonance in the desperately bleak  seems so natural a translator for dune his knack for visual grandeur will keep him making films for years but the bigger the universe the bigger the pathos thats needed to fill it undoubtedly theres an initial awkwardness in seeing these characters shift their positions on such an intricately staged intergalactic chess board with such passivity  but passivity is not a minor thing paths to predetermined places dont appear out of thin air not even the lethal blazinghot air of arrakis and dune perhaps gets stronger and more tantalizing as its 155minute runtime creeps along because villeneuve  through beautifully edited sequences of recurring imagery and hazy chronological leapfrogging  foregrounds these ideas of powerful figures who are merely biding their time for power to be snatched away finding comfort in the cognitive dissonance emphasized by the directors technical precision agency and destiny are in constant conversation when it comes to pauls story even if it takes about an hour for dune to render their dialogue legible and at its core is a messianic figure increasingly agitated about whether he can ever measure up to the narrative and aesthetic bombast he  and us by proxy  is enveloped in  dune is haunting in these implications and nearly potent enough to reflect on an entire genre as chalamets performance increasingly reflects pauls subdued tugofwar you could call the cliffhanger ending rousing if you want but im not entirely sure if villeneuve doesnt intend for the final moments of dune part 1 to be a red herring after spending the last few years debating if the director had the goods to pull this massive project off its more than a little appropriate that there exists the possibility we could spend forever wondering if this iteration of arrakiss wouldbe savior has the capacity to see his path for what it really is even as his footing grows ever more confident

Feb 15 2022,positive, dune 2021 with arrival and blade runner 2049 reigning as two of the best science fiction films of recent vintage director denis villeneuve attempts to go 3for3 with his ambitious adaptation of frank herberts spiceworld saga  or at least the first chunk of the hefty novel as evidenced by the movies alternate title of dune part one unlike villeneuves previous pair both of which are truly immersive experiences particularly arrival the best picture of 2016 as shown here this latest achievement produces a distancing effect that encourages respect rather than revelry its stateliness is both an asset and a detriment as the picture looks absolutely stunning but occasionally feels too antiseptic for its own good if nothing else it stands head and shoulders over david lynchs 1984 dud reviewed here with a stronger cast headier visual effects and a more coherent storyline timothée chalamet handles the pivotal role of paul atreides believed to be the chosen one by the various factions jockeying for control of the spiceproducing planet arrakis pauls parents are the noble duke leto oscar isaac and the devoted lady jessica rebecca ferguson arguably first among equals with a fullfledged performance while his mentors include warriors gurney halleck josh brolin and duncan idaho jason momoa on the other side of the conflict reside the evil baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård and his crew while more ambiguous in their intentions are arrakis inhabitants stilgar javier bardem and chani zendaya oh yes there are also sandworms on hand to devour the scenery even if dune is occasionally chilly to the touch theres enough here of merit to warrant the upcoming part two extras in the 4k edition consist of makingof featurettes including designing the sandworm and wardrobe from another world a look at the various players and pieces on three specific scenes gambit 1966 an agreeable caper comedy that cant quite maintain its momentum throughout its 109minute running time gambit was amusingly advertised with the tagline go ahead tell the end its too hilarious to keep secret but please dont tell the beginning that beginning spoiler finds british cat burglar harry dean michael caine explaining to his cohort in crime emile john abbott how he plans to use a eurasian dancer named nicole shirley maclaine to help him steal a valuable relic from the richest man in the world the middle eastern magnate shahbandar herbert lom its a scheme that as we see plays flawlessly in harrys mind even though the reality proves to be much more taxing nicole is brassy rather than docile shahbandar isnt a meek sheik but rather a shrewd and suspicious businessman and even harry himself isnt as smart or suave as he would like to believe theres that unwritten hollywood rule decreeing that whenever two attractive stars are cast in a movie their characters must fall in love whether it makes sense or not here it doesnt meaning that maclaine and caine are far more effective when bickering than when romancing gambit earned a trio of academy award nominations for its sets costumes and sound a remake appeared in 2012  written by the coen brothers and starring colin firth cameron diaz and alan rickman it unlike the original was a critical and commercial flop as for maclaine and caine they reunited for two more films far inferior to this one the following years woman

simple robbery turns into a case of coldblooded murder the first half of the film covers familiar ground but dickerson who also cowrote the screenplay gives it enough of a fresh spin that it remains

fred hill henry kendall is bored with his lot in life and yearns for adventure so when hes informed that an uncle is leaving him a sizable inheritance he and his wife emily joan barry leave the

others emily establishes a comfortable rapport with a british gentleman percy marmont while fred lusts after a princess betty amann whos not quite what she seems although creaky at times this is a sparkling comedy imbued with some thoughtful observations on love and marriage while rich and strange was certainly too minor to have served as inspiration for other filmmakers movies it is interesting in that its general plot outline brings to mind the rich texture of william wylers 1936 dodsworth reviewed here itself adapted from the sinclair lewis novel that was released two years before this picture while the marvelous opening sequence has a whiff of jacques tatis monsieur hulot about it shakespeare scholars will appreciate the films title taken from the tempest but cat lovers will certainly not appreciate the comedic fate of the feline slinking through the proceedings the 7th dawn 1964 seven years after the bridge on the river kwai william holden again played a combative american coping with hot weather and even hotter tensions in southeast asia he stars as ferris a former guerilla fighter who spends the years following world war ii growing his wealth as a malayan plantation owner his fellow fighter dhana capucine now a schoolteacher has become his mistress but the third part of their triangle ng tetsurô tamba left them for an education in moscow ng has now

into his good graces by offering herself as a hostage to ng in an effort to save an imprisoned dhana the sociopolitical angle carries the movie along for a good stretch but once the characters are forced to slog through the jungle in the dull third act viewers are forced to slog through the remainder of the picture shake hands with the devil 1959 opinions will naturally differ on the politics behind this drama set during the irish war of independence but there will be no arguments over the quality of james cagneys performance one of the greatest actors ever hes typically superb here as sean lenihan a kind and cheerful professor who also turns out to be a fanatical leader in the ira one of his school pupils is the irishamerican kerry oshea don murray who repeatedly turns down offers to join the cause for irish freedom since he saw enough bloodshed while serving in world war i but as kerry witnesses more atrocities being committed by the brutal british occupiers known as the black and tans  and after he himself is tortured by a particularly sadistic officer christopher rhodes  he realizes he can no longer remain on the fence murray essays the films largest role  its also the blandest role as kerry oshea will make the switch from doubter to devotee in predictable fashion the richness is instead found in other characters cagneys sean lenihan is a jekyllandhyde figure who snuffs out lives as a revolutionary as often as he saves them as a surgeon chris noonan cyril cusack is a softspoken poet whose gentleness belies his position as an ira leader and kitty brady an excellent glynis johns is a barmaid who fully commits herself to the cause and to the men who appreciate the bedroom favors she gives them but who never gains lenihans trust its odd to see michael redgrave that most british of british actors playing an irishman an ira bigwig most likely meant to be michael collins but its not surprising to see a young richard harris playing the most volatile of ira flunkies spencer 2021 anyone whos seen director pablo larraíns 2016 drama jackie will have a general idea of what to expect from his latest atbat hardly a standard biopic jackie reviewed here

performance by kristen stewart similarly gets up close and personal with its subject both in larraíns shooting style and in scripter steven knights attempts to analyze and understand the mindset of

loves her sons william and henry jack nielen and freddie spry enjoys hanging out with the royal dresser maggie sally hawkins and has an amicable relationship with the head chef sean harris but she has little use for the rest of the lot including her unfaithful and bullying husband charles jack farthing and the households senior attendant timothy spall although larraín occasionally indulges his star too much  how many shots do we really need of diana dancing her blues away  this fable from a true tragedy as its described at the start succeeds as a turbulent character study of an emotionally compromised woman whos as much a prisoner as she is a princess the vampire lovers 1970 sheridan le fanus classic 1872 novella carmilla has served as the basis for numerous vampire flicks although its probably safe to state that this bloodandboobfilled adaptation from hammer films boasts the largest fan base the first entry in the socalled karnstein trilogy  lust for a vampire and twins of evil both followed in 1971  this turned ingrid pitt into an overnight genre star by casting her in the central role of a vampire with decidedly lesbian tendencies with her penchant for buxomly beauties she first overcomes laura von spielsdorf pippa steele the daughter of a respected austrian general peter cushing before setting her sights on lauras even more enticing friend emma madeline smith theres also an attraction between carmilla and emmas governess kate omara meanwhile the men she bloodily dispatches stir no feelings but are simply foolish enough to get in her way the vampire lovers was one of the pictures that marked hammers turn away from producing literate horror yarns in which the heaving bosoms were kept clothed and toward releasing more promiscuous fare in an effort to remain visible in the wake of new types of horror films like night of the living dead and rosemarys baby the influx of nudity and extra gore didnt help  the studio was basically done by the mid1970s  but even hammers lesser efforts in this uh vein are generally watchable the vampire lovers resides above that lukewarm designation but some clumsy plotting works against its total success bluray extras include audio commentary by pitt director roy ward baker and scripter tudor gates a discussion of the film and its source material an interview with smith audio of pitt reading excerpts from carmella

Feb 12 2022,positive, every few years a film arrives that changes the landscape of cinema back in 2008 iron man was released and in turn began the creation of the most profitable franchise of this generation  the marvel cinematic universe since then the blueprint for significant studios was to release any intellectual property with potential box office value but what if a studio decided to release intellectual property without muchbeloved success warner bros answered that question with denis villeneuves dune and in turn may have laid the foundation for the beginning of a new expanded universe not seen since a galaxy far far away dune was first tackled in 1984 by the legendary david lynch to unsatisfactory results for those unfamiliar with the property lynch was given a tall order as he attempted to complete the entire story in less runtime than deniss epic first part ultimately the property was left dormant until denis was allowed to take a swing dune was left motionless primarily for failing the tall task of telling its story on the big screen as many have viewed the frank herbert novel as unadaptable denis not only steps up to the challenge but ignites a level of cinematic nirvana unseen in quite some time dune is quite significant in scale but its most grounded basic premise tells the story of the house of atreides and their leader duke leto as he is assigned to rule the planet of arrakis by the emperor however while taking over arrakis many factions are not fond of this new appointment and attempt to take down the family during this dukes son paul has visions that ultimately will force him to decide whether or not to accept his destiny denis villeneuve jon spaihts and erich roth honor herberts novel in their screenplay as they fully immerse the viewer in this world rather than handholding and explaining every ongoing event their script lets the film breathe and enables you to discover all the elements in this world in comparison dunes worldbuilding falls in line with the early seasons of game of thrones yes there are a lot of characters and yes a lot is going on but patience pays off as by the films conclusion stakes are elevated and you can draw a line on who to root for and against bringing the screenplay to life is one of the best cast ensembles of the year while lynchs dune gave us the gift of kyle mclaughlin timothée chalamets paul is perfection but of course there are roles that some actors are meant to play and chalamet was destined to bring paul to life as he runs through an array of emotions that bring to light whether or not paul is meant to fulfill his destiny complementing chalamet is the always reliable rebecca ferguson while first coming off as a throwaway character her impact on the films second half stands out with some of my favorite moments while some of the cast gets minimal screen time they each lay the groundwork for what is expected to be further expanded roles in the second entry in the series the sheer scale of villeneuves vision is aided by the brilliant work of cinematographer greig fraser point blank its the most beautiful looking film of the year frasers work creates a world that surpasses the scifi world and enters the stratosphere of the old hollywood epic throughout i began to think of dune in the same cinematographic space of lawrence of arabia and how frasers work is that good hans zimmers score elevates the technical marvel of frasers cinematography while always reliable it felt that zimmer attempted to replicate his scores from the dark knight and inception for the past 13 years this time around hansy shifts the sounds of these scores and creates an epic sound that matches the sheer magnitude of dune its the best score of the year and theres little question as to whether hans is worthy of an oscar nomination and a second win fans of frank herberts dune will be delighted that villeneuve treated his acclaimed novel with care and respect while the film is dependent on a second part being greenlit it does not take away from the accomplishment denis and the company created with this film hypnotizing and emotional this spectacle is set to immerse cinephiles into villeneuves magnum opus and one that is set to redefine the theatrical experience
Feb 12 2022,neutral, i must not fear fear is the mindkiller fear is the little death that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain dune is the magnum opus of author frank herbert first published in 1965 the awardwinning book is a masterpiece while it may not have invented the space opera its certainly one of the most significant examples in scifi literature dune is the gold standard for fictional worldbuilding and mythology by which all others should be measured with dune frank herbert didnt just tell the story of the young noble paul atreides he also created a whole history around an alternative future for humanity set eons after the present day dune is to science fiction what the lord of the rings is to fantasy while there have been multiple motion picture adaptations of herberts saga in the past most notably david lynchs 1984 attempt renowned filmmaker denis villeneuve offers his latest attempt with the longdelayed dune feature eons into the future after humanity has already undergone a mass rejection of advanced ai and somewhat of a renaissance the known universe is colonized and ruled by a feudal system of royal houses due to past events making the invention and utilization of thinking machines taboo humanity instead sought to strengthen their minds as a substitute leading to the creation of the mentat order the bene gesserit and the spacing guild the spacing guild and its navigators are responsible for overseeing interstellar space travel made possible thanks to a substance known as the spice melange aka the spice the spice can only be found and mined from the inhospitable desert planet arrakis or dune  among the royal houses is the noble and honorable house atreides rulers of planet caladan and led by duke leto atreides isaac for years arrakis and its indigenous people the fremen have suffered at the heel of house atreides archrival the vicious house harkonnen strangely enough the universes emperor padisham iv has opted to shift course with dune demoting house harkonnen from their failed stewardship of arrakis and instead granting the fiefdom to duke leto now the onus of mining the spice and bringing peace between the royal houses and the fremen falls on duke leto however house corrinos gift of stewardship of arrakis to house of atreides is not the gift it appears but the start of a deadly conspiracy that could mean the ruin of duke letos family line son to duke leto and his former bene gesserit consort lady jessica ferguson is paul atreides chalamet even before the family commutes to arrakis paul is already plagued by prescient dreams of the planet some of which hold an ill omen for his closest friends and house atreides subjects duke leto charges top operative duncan idaho momoa to chart an advance mission to arrakis to contact the fremen in attempts to forge a peaceful alliance between the two groups while paul is duke letos heir hes trained for action by the stern and stoic atreides warmaster gurney halleck brolin paul is certainly his fathers son but his mothers as well lady jessica once belonged to a mysterious order of the bene gesserit whose goals dont necessarily align with that of house atreides and appear to have farreaching plans thanks to his mother paul is attempting to finetune extrasensory abilities pioneered by the bene gesserit sisterhood arrakis was no mere gift by the emperor on an unforgiving desert planet with no water adversaries for house atreides are apparent on all sides however on arrakis there exists talk of a messiah or madhi who will free the fremen from oppression and make arrakis into a lush paradise pauls arrival on dune appears to be prophetic to its natives with a deadly trap about to be sprung young paul atreides could be the key to unlocking arrakis  despite its flaws its unlikely that any director other than denis villeneuve could have pulled off dune at the very least he respects the grandeur and elegance of this classic story the visuals at work here are jawdropping and aweinspiring the spaceships look like giant cocoonlike structures that fill up the entire screen they look like they were ripped from the covers of the books with giant gaping hatches every penny of the films 165 million budget from the ornithopters to shaihulud is shown onscreen villeneuve has brought the world of frank herbert to life and its never looked better villeneuve cinematographer greig fraser and production designer patrice vermette not only achieve the visual ambition of dune but an amazing level of verisimilitude even down to the deserts flora and fauna such as a little mouse thats able to survive the harshest of conditions  the casts two biggest standouts are easily oscar isaac as leto and timothée chalamet as paul isaacs honorable leto is an aspirational yet tragic figure its easy to see why hes beloved by his subjects and inspires such fervent loyalty hes a man of reason the compassionate and wise leader whom everyone wants unfortunately its that very leadership that has made him an object of hatred for his adversaries who want nothing more than to destroy his entire line isaac perfectly depicts letos nobility his love for his friends and his sincerity in his attempts to lead arrakis to a better future without naïveté in the fate that awaits house atreides if they fail isaac captures the necessary gravitas for leto among todays crop of young actors timothée chalamet was the only choice for paul his personality is refreshing and hes smart enough to be aware of the danger surrounding himself and his family paul is desperate to help yet hes not necessarily the best experienced to know how chalamet takes paul from his very roots and shows the start of his grand journey from a young upstart noble to someone who will become something more chalamets performance has a sweet believable innocence but beneath that innocence theres genuine fear a fear that paul must eventually face and let pass through him  the more notable performances among the supporting cast are the smaller more tertiary roles such as stephen mckinley henderson as atreides chief mentat thufir hawat chen chang as atreides physician dr wellington yueh and david dastmalchian as the harkonnen stooge  piter de vries they are proof that there are no small parts they all bring a unique energy to each of their characters and offer texture to this unique view of the future javier bardem also makes the most of his screentime as the fremen leader stilgar but his performance in this film demonstrates that its not yet his time to shine brolin captures the more serious nature of gurney halleck quite well unfortunately the movie does not get to show his softer side along with his love for music and the baliset this exemplifies one of the unfortunate aspects of cinematic adaptations for dense scifi literature the producers and writers felt it was necessary to justify jason momoas casting as duncan idaho who is better described as duncan idabro idahos role is significantly beefed up a bit too much in this role expanding a character role to fit the actor doesnt work it would be preferable for the actor to bring the character of idaho to life aquaman is duncan idaho so he needs more screentime fight scenes and cool oneliners gurney cant play his baliset but duncan needs to be shown killing lots more enemies while the movies production design and visuals are topnotch there are a couple of instances where the movie does not meet its full visual ambition the pain box scene a pivotal scene straight out of the books opening chapter looks even less inspiring than the 2000 scifi tv miniseries secondly paul never even gets to recite the litany against fear even once the way the scene plays out in the film focuses more on lady jessica which undercuts pauls journey and struggle additionally it can also be seen where the shadow of blade runner 2049s weak box office looms large over villeneuve there are many giant spaceships in dune but they are only depicted in orbit or just before takeoff theres no depiction of spacing guild navigators no actual interstellar space travel or visualization for how the navigators plot course through space these are the parts where villeneuve plays it safe with dune when he really should not have these concepts make dune pure scifi and the production really should have gone all out and shown them onscreen  what is commendable in the favor of villeneuve who cowrote the script with jon spaihts and eric roth is that a good chunk of the books initial half remains in the film while not an exceptional word for word adaptation of the book it does make a better attempt at adapting the source material despite multiple hiccups that said there is one significant instance where villeneuve breaks the show dont tell rule showing the cards of a certain major development a little too early one particular line came off as a bit patronizing like villeneuve had to make sure the audience understands whats going on not trusting more casual moviegoers  the biggest problem with dune is that it cannot adapt the entire first novel at two hours and 35 minutes the film is already at a copious length the pacing is not bad at all considering the length and such dense material the unfortunate part is the movie abruptly ends subplots that are developed and introduced are left dangling without significant payoff  the ending point villeneuve and his cowriters opted for came out rather clumsy it omits one of pauls best and most pivotal moments after significant screentime was dedicated to creating that moment its possible this moment might come up again in a later movie adapting the rest of the book but theres still no guarantee that movie will even happen that is the pitfall of ending a movie in the middle of a story and having to make the middle portion a third act for an already long movie betting on the hope there will be enough interest to finish it later  the result is that dune feels incomplete hopefully things will play out much better if the planned sequel does happen but it feels like cheating to make a movie this way on the other hand the positive takeaway from this choice leaves the audience anxious for more while much of hans zimmers work as a composer has largely been uninspired over the course of the last decade his score for dune is his best work in years it actually sounds unique grand and epic once it moves to arrakis the themes sound fitting and immense this is not a lazy piece of phoned in work this time around for zimmer regardless of some specific plotting and casting missteps there is fine artistry at work in this take on frank herberts epic scifi saga and one of the greatest novels ever written at the very least its a valiant effort in bringing pure scifi to the screen with the necessary epic grandeur dune is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen at least once

Feb 12 2022,positive, near the end of denis villeneuves dune theres a brief moment where our hero paul atreides played by timothée chalamet sees a small rodent scurrying on the sand paul notices how the creatures large ears accumulate moisture into a droplet which it uses to sustain itself under the harsh desert conditions sometime later hopefully we will see paul name himself muaddib after the rodent when he leads the fremen the nomadic people of arrakis but unless youve read frank herberts 1965 novelor the wikipedia summary as people find the book difficult to finishthe significance of this moment may elude you and yet villeneuve and his cowriters eric roth and jon spaihts included the scene in their adaptation their devotion to herberts text captures his layered investigation of imperialism middleeastern culture ecology industry patriarchy and matriarchy and political strategy in fine detail tackling source material considered unfilmable by some villeneuve leaves no theme untapped and does what seemed impossible by capturing the books depth in a major motion picture its a perfectly cast and handsomely designed production full of incredible sights but given that dune represents only half of herberts story the other half of which remains to be filmed or even greenlit at the time of this review were left to wonder whether chalamet will ever become muaddib the latest attempt to bring herberts tome to the big screen shares in a history of troubled adaptations chilean filmmaker alejandro jodorowsky first tried in the mid1970s assembling artists like moebius hr giger and chris foss to create elaborate designs for a proposed 12hour film that was never to be david lynch completed a screen version released in 1984 but he lost control to producer dino de laurentiis even if jodorowsky or lynch had been given limitless funds and creative freedom to complete their adaptations the resulting films wouldnt have been true to herberts book both directors intended to explore aspects that interested them most jodorowsky seemed more driven by the potential for avantgarde filmmaking techniques and psychedelic artifice than doing the material justice however lynchs take while beautifully staged reduced the story to its roots in joseph campbells monomyth developing the idea of pauls dreams leading to his emergence as a hero villeneuve is more selfless than his predecessors he applies his aesthetic of lingering camerawork and mesmerizing visuals to serve herberts vision crafting a faithful translation writing this review then becomes a tricky task for one i cannot ignore that feeling of emptiness that dune left me with when the credits began to roll should the film be blamed for this or is that just the nature of this particular beast also i cannot ignore everything i felt before that emptiness took over villeneuve does something incredible by visualizing certain scenes and characters the way i envisioned them when reading the book which i cherish few sciencefiction films have realized their source material so well so far anyway the director cinematographer greig fraser and production designer patrice vermette render distinct worlds that reflect the storys setting of several thousands of years in the future the production resists the ostentation of lynchs version preferring an elegant functionality to the costumes sets vehicles and planetary designs yet we see familiar sights suggesting they originated from the unmentioned earth small details such as bullfighting and bagpipes appear around the atreides family who hail from the ocean planet caladan but have been tasked with overseeing arrakis a planet that produces spice needed for intergalactic travelit also opens the mind and extends life the fremen clearly drawn from islamic and middleeastern cultures have a familiar spirituality that attracts paul recalling the titular enigma in lawrence of arabia 1962 the films best scenes involve the curt stilgar javier bardem whose social graces confound most members of house atreides  the story of dune also remains true to the book although the script makes slight alterations to enhance the depth of certain characters paul of course has more personality thanks to chalamets slender frame inwardness and vulnerable gestures his chummy relationship with his mentors duncan idaho jason momoa and gurney halleck josh brolin prove alternately endearing and parental oscar isaac too brings a great deal of humanity to pauls father duke leto whose otherwise noble eyes also contain a parents unwavering love the screenplays best alteration builds upon lady jessica rebecca ferguson pauls mother and member of the bene gesserita group of powerful women who work in secret to shift power in the universe away from the unseen emperor through haunting sound design and flashes of dream imagery laden with blood and fire paul hears the whispers of the bene gesserit and sees glimpses of his future path as a revolutionary alongside the fremen woman chani zendaya jessica hints that his future with the fremen will bridge space and time past and future all of this talk of emergence and fate on a desert planet and the viewer will begin to realize just how much george lucas lifted from herbert to write star wars 1977  still in its current halved form dune is an emotionally dissatisfying experiencemainly due to extratextual issuesalbeit one that has the potential of becoming one of the greatest sciencefiction films ever made if part two happens and its just as wellcrafted as part one then cinephiles have a treasure awaiting them but i feel about dune similarly to how i felt in 2001 about the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring another openended chapter in a series i recognize this films individual excellence but its lasting effect may depend on what follows at least with peter jacksons trilogy he filmed them all simultaneously representing an enormous commitment on the part of new line cinema with dune the studios commitment remains to be seen in the meantime villeneuves treatment results in a million details that intrigue from the way he portrays the voice in disorienting layers of sound to the way the mouths of arrakis enormous sandworms resemble the iris of an eye the director achieves another impressive trick by casting a roster of allstar performers who disappear entirely into their roles best of all villeneuve seems to understand the material better than any other director before him he points every element of the cinematic apparatus toward the singular goal of realizing herberts vision its gratifying to see a filmmaker who understands dune finally but it makes my hope for a sequel even more desperate and at this moment worrisome 
Feb 12 2022,positive,sure it is long and dense but the drama of dune is engaging and it does make the audience care about its characters and stories
Feb 12 2022,positive, dune is a superb scifi epic that shocks the senses this review explores the movie on its own without reflecting its ability to adapt frank herberts 1965 novel director and cowriter denis villeneuve crafts an experience that seeks to truly immerse the audience in its world rather than just tell a story it wont be for everyone but its quite hypnotizing if you give into it 10191 is the year paul atreides timothée chalamet is the son of a noble family with high expectations for his future his family is tasked with ruling and protecting a dangerous desert planet arrakis this planet has the spice melange which can extend human life and create superhuman abilities  however arrakis has dangers that the noble family isnt entirely prepared for the native fremen people and incoming invaders are just a couple of the dangers the heat is inhospitable and massive sandworms travel underneath the desert sands surface nonetheless the noble family plans to serve and protect dune supposedly covers roughly the first half of the novel the openings subtitle reads part one which truly sets the tone that it isnt going to deliver the whole story it lays the groundwork for a universe that is so rich it deserves more than one movie dune takes its time to get acclimated it progressively introduces the characters and the stakes but never gives too much away  dune is a scifi movie that places emphasis on family pauls father duke leto atreides oscar isaac gives him insight into leadership however pauls relationship with his mother lady jessica atreides rebecca ferguson is further emphasized the motherson relationship is truly tested as theyre forced into various dangerous situations this dynamic is the storys genuine driver to make viewers care about their journey dune is an intentionally slowmoving scifi epic the movie seeks to absorb you into its universe before it advances it does so with villeneuves superb direction greig frasers gorgeous cinematography and hans zimmers otherworldly score its otherworldly in both its nature and its quality every scene further hypnotizes deeper into its grasp making the 155minute runtime feel much shorter than it is the characters depth is a tad lacking yet dune still manages to make their story matter by becoming invested in their world it simultaneously invests its audience in its characters paul is the least captivating of the bunch although chalamet does what he can with the part fergusons lady jessica is the most impactful performance here showcasing incredible depth and nuance  dune is not the action spectacle that some folks may be expecting its a slowmoving yet entirely immersive scifi epic see it on the biggest screen with the loudest sound system available the movie will also be debuting on the streaming service hbo max but this is a film that begs for your total attention in a dark theater dune is an experience let it wash over you im an avid film buff whos always on the search for the next best indie or horror movie im most likely enjoying a nice cup of tea while writing film reviews or entertainment news
Feb 12 2022,positive, a young man is destined for great things its a set up so commonplace that we rarely give it a second look within fantasy and science fiction its even more expected which is why dune has always stood out from the rest frank herberts novel is filled with political intrigue between warring houses and wondrous worlds that feel fully lived in yet at the center of it is paul atreides timothée chalamet and his journey to find his own path through life despite many hands guiding him through it as much a philosophical comingofage tale as an epic political science fiction and fantasy story denis villeneuves adaptation of dune is a wonder to behold and fully realizes a universe that beyond its massive scale and otherworldly creations is subject to the same human problems that exist today those unfamiliar with herberts novel may find themselves at a slight disadvantage when they begin watching dune villeneuve goes the same route as peter jackson did with the lord of the rings adaptations and does not hold the audiences hand until terms like gom jabbar kwisatz haderach and shaihulud are beaten into their brains before moving on instead villeneuve lets these terms wash over the audience sinking in if they do but moving on if they dont the term isnt crucial to understand right away its what it represents that matters most dune follows paul as he and the rest of house atreides leave their home planet of caladan to accept stewardship over planet arrakis and oversee the manufacturing of the galaxys most important resource spice complications ensue when they arrive on the planet and find that the previous owners house harkonnen have left them with a barely operable spice operation while house atreides attempts to get their mining operation back on its feet plans are set in motion that will have massive ramifications to everyone involved when people talk about dune they always bring up the storys devotion to spice why is spice so damn important well the film gives a succinct explanation it powers everything transplanted to modern society that resource could just as easily be oil or water something to be hoarded and privatized villeneuve doesnt spend too much time on the importance of spice other than reiterating how crucial it is that everything runs smoothly so the universe can run smoothly instead where villeneuve centers dune is on paul and the many forces attempting to shepherd him in different directions hes heir to the throne and will succeed his father duke leto atreides oscar isaac but is also being trained by his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson to harness the power of the voice and hopefully become the chosen one or the kwisatz haderach as instructed by the allfemale religious organization known as the bene gesserit then there are these dreams that paul continues to have of a girl zendaya on arrakis that suggests a different path than the two he is being led on theres a reason dune was largely considered unadaptable and its immediately evident when you try to explain the plot to someone its a story with many characters all of which have a significant role to play even if their character seems minor its the kind of intricate web where its almost impossible to follow along completely because everyone has their own motivations guiding them when you take into account that the opening title card of this film reads dune part one its clear that villeneuve had to make the conscious decision to split the book into two parts when adapting it to film theres just no way to take a book that dense and turn it into one film without losing so much of its intent see david lynchs 1984 adaptation once a decision like that is made then comes how the film will be framed thats the magic of dune theres this grander narrative initiated behindthescenes by the emperor of the imperium that forces house harkonnen and house atreides at each others throats spectacle and scale extend out from this conflict giving dune its massive scope and astounding setpieces these range from the first time paul encounters a sandworm to armies fighting in closecombat to flying through a sandstorm all accompanied by a dizzying score from hans zimmer that features so much variety without losing the films scope these setpieces also lend themselves to a visually gorgeous film that feels like a companion piece to blade runner 2049  villeneuves other ambitious science fiction film though this one has less emphasis on lighting and the overall noir aesthetic of blade runner it makes up for it with wide vistas and an equal emphasis on mood and scale shot by greig fraser theres an oppressiveness to a lot of dunes composition that mirrors pauls own struggle to get out from everyone elses expectations of him the production design also helps with that surrounding each house with brutalist architecture and the planet of arrakis itself forcing house atreides indoors to the dimly lit rooms shielded from the sun  down a layer from the spectacle is the relationship between paul and his parents and their separate plans for him thats where the film finds its heartbeat it is not until paul steps foot on the sands of arrakis that he appears to have autonomy over himself a lot of dune is shot close to the characters faces often because they are alone in a room or feel separated from those around them the relationship between leto and jessica is almost entirely told visually with the two of them rarely speaking to each other and yet appearing to love each other wholly and completely then there are the relationships paul has with so many other characters as royalty he doesnt really have friends more so than he has strong bonds with allies jason momoas first appearance as duncan idaho immediately establishes the close relationship that he and paul have even though he is also pauls combat instructor every character that paul interacts with immediately feels like theres a lifetime of camaraderie even if he might be kept at an arms length from the more serious discussions surrounding his life dune also works really well because not only does every character feel lived in and end up feeling significant theyre also played by extremely charismatic actors who do so much in the role the supporting cast overall is stacked with actors all providing great performances from stephen mckinley henderson to josh brolin to david dastmalchian and dave bautista to javier bardem and sharon duncanbrewster there are so many fantastic performances that all lend themselves completely to villeneuves vision thats just the supporting cast all of whom give it their all as if theyll never get to do a movie like this again not only does the casting in the film feel true to herberts novel it elevates the significance of everything within it nothing is just a role that needs to be filled its a character that needs to be lived in this is to say nothing of the two most important roles in the film paul and jessica chalamet isnt quite revelatory as paul but he fits the role snugly and does a fantastic job carrying a film that relies heavily on introspection and carrying the burden others have placed on him its really when dune begins exploring lady jessica and starts prying at her character where the mvp of the films cast stands tall rebecca ferguson is a powerhouse in this turning jessica into a fierce independent woman capable of operating with just as much precision in the shadows as in the light she can juggle the most emotional sequences with ones that demand her to be brutal and royal at the same time its arguably her best performance in a career that has already seen many great roles significantly elevated by her presence the key to dune is that it depends on its humanity so while the science fiction and fantasy elements are there and done well its making sure the characters never feel like we need an evil henchman that gives dune its power the stakes are just as real for one person as they are the other loss is loss no matter who is involved its easy to follow along with each characters plight because theyre relatable in some way this is evident in the recurring idea in house atreides of the desire to do good when the world seems to be working against you and the attempt to be yourself when external forces pressure you into fulfilling a role unfortunately the downside to everything with dune is that it doesnt end in a way that will satisfy most narratively its part one of an intended twopart series where it leaves things hangs a lot of loose threads that will be entertaining to pick back up with a character who makes a meaningful choice at the end that will define his entire being as a whole movie its impossible for it to feel complete but there are not much better ways to end a first part than where it does at the end of the day dune is a triumph it builds a world and strings together so many narrative threads and characters that its mind boggling how well it works theres an entire universe to explore but villeneuve manages to let it wash over you and fully immerse the audience in its political and religious underpinnings its hard to call it his best movie when it dangles so many unfinished stories in the air but it is certainly his greatest achievement in almost every respect part two cannot come soon enough chris is a graduate of communications from simon fraser university and resides in victoria british columbia given a pint he will talk for days about action films video games and the works of john carpenter
Feb 11 2022,positive, denis villeneuve brings his distinctly grandiose style to a classic that has been begging for a bigscreen adaptation in the age of blockbuster franchises and he makes the final product stand out in a big way dune part one hits theatres on october 21 and you can stream it on hbo max in the us on the same day from 6pm et dune part two and an hbo max original series dune sisterhood are due out in 2023 the story follows the young paul atreides as he relocates with his family from his ancestral planet caladan to the desert planet arrakis his father a duke has been assigned to oversee the planet by the ruling empire arrakis is where spice  a rare and extremely valuable substance used for space travel  is harvested but upon arrival its clear the atreides family is a target most notably of the rival harkonnen family who want to control the spice and the native population of arrakis the fremen all the while paul is training to master the powers passed down by his mother a member of the bene gesserit a typically female sect known to many as witches paul may be the prophesied kwisatz haderach a powerful messiah who could be instrumental in the upcoming conflicts on arrakis dune is chock full of major stars too timothée chalamet plays paul and hes joined by zendaya rebecca ferguson oscar isaac josh brolin stellan skarsgård dave bautista stephen mckinley henderson charlotte rampling jason momoa javier bardem and more the 2013 documentary jodorowskys dune lays out the making of a dune adaptation that never actually materialized the cult auteur alejandro jodorowskys take on the source material attracted immense talent and some initial financial backing but as its aspirations grew so did pushback the project eventually fizzled out what was left however was a huge legacy of creative work that made its way into other projects jodorowskys dune has its fingerprints on everything from star wars to alien to raiders of the lost ark to blade runner to the terminator and so many more even david lynchs own largely reviled 1984 adaptation of dune has traces of it its fascinating to watch denis villeneuve draw very directly from those aesthetics blending concepts and visuals from both the nonexistent dune and the many films it did inspire im sure someone will eventually edit together a string of inspirations for villeneuves vision but for now its incredibly rewarding to tease apart the look of the world onscreen and why its so familiar that aesthetic is broadly a grim one we see distinctly fascist architecture ugly brutalist buildings made of concrete populate all of the imperial worlds grotesquely organiclooking machinery also peppers the landscape and all of that is juxtaposed with gorgeous nature shots with vast oceans of water sand and stars filling the screen its all mesmerizing and verging on sublime and thats the bulk of the films appeal really its worldbuilding writ large theres a narrative of course and characters but the political intrigue is relatively convoluted we get bits and pieces of it often incomplete and drowned out by the majesty of the natural world constantly threatening to eat up the nasty human world  in the case of the giant sandworms of arrakis quite literally dune is big in every sense its event viewing and doesnt shy away from the bizarreness of its source material from the repugnant harkonnen clan to the recycling of sweat and spit to cryptic visions of a coming messiah as with his previous film blade runner 2049 villeneuve takes a more is more approach here and that means the scale of this thing is truly epic in the classical sense of the word but it also means the pacing can feel a bit chaotic rushing through exposition one minute and then just casually hanging out on some sand dunes the next to soak in the beauty this suits the worldbuilding elements no doubt i feel like i could actually visit the planets arrakis and caladan but more i can believe that they are part of a much bigger inhabited galaxy without seeing it these places exist their people are real the resources they fight over are indeed precious and finite this is the great gift of dune it compels us to suspend our disbelief and become immersed in its universe the imax screen i saw it on surely didnt hurt but i have no doubt villeneuves efforts will still pay off on hbo max of course by splitting the film in two villeneuve is also denying us a great deal of narrative resolution it would be nice for dune to feel a little more complete on its own villeneuve picks a smart point to end on but were watching the pieces being put in place on the game board without actually seeing a whole lot of gameplay worldbuilding only goes so far and at the end of the day this is effectively the first half of a movie maybe none of that matters though as the film certainly left me wanting a dune part two hopefully warner bros lets this story live on to its conclusion
Feb 10 2022,positive, denis villeneuves longawaited adaptation of dune is contender a for one of the most beautiful science fiction movies of all time thats only let down by a screenplay that lacks any real flair  its here its beautiful and its so bassy it makes you vibrate in your seat denis villeneuves longawaited adaptation of dune has finally premiered on the sunny shores of the lido at the venice film festival treating audiences to an astronomically impressive film that favours characterisation over bombastic action  the epicbilled in its opening credits as dune part oneisnt just a contender for one of the most stunning science fiction movies of all time but perfectly strikes the balance of leaving you positively parched for part two while never feeling like half a film with the best hans zimmer score of the past decade and endless crisp tableaus of jawdropping cinematography denis villeneuve has delivered and then some of his mission to give frank herberts pioneering novel due diligence on the big screen  dreams are messages from the deep reads the opening message of dune setting the tantalizing scene for the following 155 minutes of sheer cinematic prowess if youre not overly familiar with the source novel of the same name villeneuve has you in safe handseasily sketching the characters locations and backstories for any arrakis newbies without an annoying sense of spoonfeeding for any diehard duneheads the year is 10191 and house atreidescomprising of duke leto oscar isaac lady jessica rebecca ferguson and their son paul timothée chalamet are readying themselves to leave their home planet of caladan flanked by their master of assassins stephen mckinley henderson weapons master josh brolin swordmaster jason momoa and doctor chang chen they are set to take control of arrakis a desert planet home to spice this sacred hallucinogen not only enhances mental capabilities but is hinted to have potential uses for interplanetary space travel  despite duke letos early assertion that there is no call we do not answer no faith we do not betray house atreides is rightfully nervous about the move arrakis is populated by millions of fremen the planets native inhabitants who are mistrustful of those who continue to colonise their home in order to harvest spice fremen members include chani zendaya a mysterious young woman who continues to appear in pauls dreams and stilgar javier bardem the leader of one fremen group on dune  whats more arrakis previous rulershouse harkonnenarent too pleased about being usurped from their role of power and are already ancient enemies of house atreides the blancmangelike baron stellan skarsgård and his henchmen glossu dave bautista and piter david dastmalchian scheme to ensure house atreides are doomed to fail partnering with an emperor who is threatened by the growing power and prestige of the family  running alongside these more political struggles for power is a more spiritual search for the one or kwisatz haderach someone who can access memories see the future and exercise superhuman cognitive powers a mysterious female group known as bene gesserit headed by reverend mother gaius helen mohiam charlotte rampling have been crossbreeding different houses in order to try and locate the one and if that wasnt enough the entire planet of arrakis is in oscillating fear and awe of giant subterranean sandworms that threaten to consume everything in sight every time they hear a thudding footstep  in undoubtedly his best performance since call me by your name timothée chalamet shines as the central homeric hero born with an albatross around his neck he plays paul atreides with an athletic angst that stands strong in the films airtight ensemble easily rising to the task of such a demanding enigmatic role as well as his trademark vulnerability all furrowed brow and byronic curls chalamet is forthright and fierce when needed a believable fledgling leader that exudes his houses trademark loyalty  another highlight is rebecca ferguson who serves as the films emotional corenot as a hackneyed weepy woman trying to protect her family but a mysterious and spiritual figure who sees horror fear and destiny in a way that others do not grande dame of cinema charlotte rampling draws upon her long history of cold fish roles to frighten everyone unlucky enough to cross her steelyeyed path  as the brusque weapons master to house atreides its a shame that josh brolin fades into the background an early training scene with paul feels merely expository to prove that the young boy can indeed fight when provoked and the character has little significance beyond that in part one however jason momoa proves for the umpteenth time his status as one of the most charismatic men in hollywood bringing a recognisable gentlegiantthatbaresitsteeth energy to the screen only really making an appearance over two hours in well have to wait until part two to truly see how zendaya chews the scene as the blueeyed chani and how javier bardems character will develop beyond an initial blank gruffness  put simply dune is a visual feastnay banquetthat takes us from stunning locale to stunning locale before you even have time to drink in the exquisite composition villeneuve does an excellent job with worldbuilding making each location fleshed out and unique whether its the dusty climes of arrakis with the air alive with specks of glinting gold or the windswept shores of the oceanic caladan the feeling is painterly turneresque and truly breathtaking  cinematographer greig fraser makes us choke on the dust and sand that fills the planet while never resorting to dull or muddy opacity thankfully dune avoids the ugly greenscreen trappings of many modern films that rely heavily on cgi it truly feels not like a twodimensional dystopia but a frightening and possible version of the future which is exactly what this world is meant to be  filming also took place on location in jordan and abu dhabi adding real texture that technology often tries and fails to emulate in particular one scene that comes around the middlewhere we witness spice harvesting interrupted by our first glimpse at a sandwormis simply breathtaking costume designer jacqueline goya studied the ochretoned paintings of francisco goya for inspiration in the characters clothing balancing textural history with functional futurism from the reverend mothers kamilavkastyle headpiece to lady jessicas goldencrusted veil each piece hides details about the characters  evoking the eerie pulsating rhythms that send sandworms into a frenzy hans zimmers score is spasmodic cinemashaking eardrumbursting stuff the chanting and wailing of female voices reflects the power that lady jessica and the rest of the besse gesserit have on the direction of the drama as well as the feminine presence haunting pauls dreams  while dune looks incredible an area that perhaps suffers is the screenplay coadapted for the screen by villeneuve jon spaihts and forrest gump writer eric roth theres a real absence of literary flair considering the source prose this is undoubtedly a choice to make the dialogue as natural as possible but with such visual pomp and ceremony more talky scenes often feel a little flat many characters deliver their lines in irritating whispery vocal fry often deployed by actors in an attempt to evoke a sense of hushed dramatism  any poetic phrasing one might hope to see translated from the book seems to be gone and what dialogue is written doesnt seem to be utilized to its best effect with a 400page novel you can take time to introduce your dystopias concepts and language but with this film sometimes the real significance of certain objects and concepts struggle to stick in the memory a second watch might be needed in order to tell your gom jabbars from your chakobsa  dune is sure to satiate the scepticism of herbert purists and win over fresh audiences alike its not quite an emotional suckerpunch but its cinema loud gorgeous and sorely missed denis villeneuve has described this film as an appetiser for the second part still to come which is the main meal if thats the case then were all in for an absolute treat    steph green  steph is a freelance film critic from london she has written for outlets including sight  sound the bfi little white lies new

Feb 3 2022,positive, of course that didnt happen even the easy availability of free vaccinations didnt persuade a significant segment of the population to embrace science and community over conspiracy and hostility  whats that have to do with me making my choices for the best movies of the year as i have done very year since gulp 1996  but now there are reasons beyond convenience to stay home i frequently go to the movies the screenings are almost never crowded and thus feel safe but who am i to tell you you should  as a result of this ongoing pandemic reality ive opened the doors to well everything though of course ive seen only a very tiny fraction of everything  most of the movies below did play at a memphis movie theater or during the indie memphis film festival in 2021 but a few didnt and most of those that did screen here probably found their largest audiences at home via netflix or hulu or amazon or some other streaming service opening the doors to everything is intimidating and humbling im very much aware that i likely will encounter in the months to come many movies from 2021 that should be mentioned here  an unconventional year calls for an unconventional approach a top 10 list can be found below but what you mostly will find here are 13 categories containing most of my choices for the best newrelease movies i saw in 2021 i picked 13 because this feels like an unlucky year but its actually been a good one for movies if not for the theatrical movie business and the evidence can be found in these titles nobody is making movies that feel more alive

released in theaters i was a freshman at wheaton college and went to see it with a group of dorm friends it was a magical memorable moviegoing experience awesomely cinematic and transportive in retrospect i wonder if that trilogy was the last great big cinematic event with the exception of christopher nolans films and terrence malicks the tree of life few moviegoing experiences have matched the awe i experienced watching lord of the rings will we ever have movies like that again  moviewatching is changing the screens are smaller the experience less communal for all but the biggesttentpole superhero movies most people seem to prefer watching movies from the convenience of home how will the evolving economics of hollywood change the nature of the films produced time will

excellent memorable thoughtful theologically interesting and redemptive releases of the year as always viewers should use discretion in terms of content though i chose only movies that are in some way edifyingdepicting goodness truth or beauty in ways christian viewers can celebrateseveral films on my list are rated r or tvma and should be viewed with caution and discernment few films gave me more joy this year than kenneth branaghs semiautobiographical film about a working class family in 1960s belfast though the troubles of protestantcatholic conflict are in the background in important waysthe foreground here is family three generations of a northern irish protestant family who have called belfast home for ages i love so much about this movie its depictions of traditional married love the awe and innocence of 9yearold buddy the beautiful embrace of membership in community and place the celebration of cinema and beauty dancing even amid the reality of death but perhaps most of all i love how belfast captures the sehnsucht longing that another northern irish protestantc s lewisonce described as permanent as it feels in our hearts home in this life is always a phantom and

Jan 24 2022,positive, imagine if star wars a new hope part one ended overlooking mos eisley as obiwan says you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy we must be cautious director denis villeneuves much anticipated rework of frank herberts dune was held back from theaters an entire year and film production reportedly stopped while waiting for a release date unlike david lynchs 1984 dune trying to cram an entire book into one movie and cutting it to ribbons trying to make it fit villeneuve wanted to take the time to tell the story film technology has come a long way in almost forty years too so better tools are available to realize the beloved science fiction novel the trailers tease the vast scope of the saga and how small mere humans are in comparison but since were only getting part of the first book how complete can part one actually be the new dune is for lack of a better word incredible  not just arrakis but the entire production design the dragonflylooking ornithopters for example have never before looked so plausible or realistic even down to the labels on the instrument gauges the level of detail is astounding even taking its time however key parts of the story are still glossed over particularly the political intrigue and machinations its always a little sad when modern audiences cant be trusted with instory reasons why characters engage in action sequences what does appear onscreen is exhilarating making the runtime feel much shorter than it is by the time the credits roll  unlike the fellowship of the ring telling a lot of story up to a known stopping point dune part one feels more like a downpayment on the promise of more zendayas chani is barely in it chalamets paul is just getting interesting before the credits and the film ends on a glimmer of hope when things are darkest its the bottom of the first huge hill on a spectacular roller coaster launching into a dark tunnel just before bonking your head on a to be continued sign and being asked to leave the ride not a spoiler but withholding part one from the title is like leaving of mars off of john carter youre not fooling anyone folks  it isnt fair to compare the lynch film  with a production aesthetic eerily similar to krull if you really think about it  to the villeneuve films stillsuits and spacecraft following a decade of superhero movie effects dune 2021 looks huge bigger screens and speakers are going to show and boom more theres also a lot of emotion packed into it  you cant stage a coup without breaking a few peoples backs  and these folks enjoy seizing the day and night the worst part now is the wait  locking down the cast getting new things built and actually filming and editing the thing  but as of this writing dune part two is slated for fall 2023 dune part one is rated pg13 for sequences of strong violence some disturbing images suggestive material and whoa sandworms you hate em right i hate em myself to be fair david lynch filmed many many hours worth of material for the 1984 film however it wasnt his choice for most of that film to hit the cutting room floor in fact it was the studio who requested the cut down its part of the reason david lynch wanted his name removed from the final theatrical cut the studio wouldnt agree he did have his wish granted for the extended tv release when his name was removed and replaced by one of the last uses of the alan smithee pseudonym its too bad the studio in 1984 didnt have the foresight to agree to a multipart film series seeing the amount of film left on the floor it certainly would have made the film more cohesive and longer however one change that i didnt really like was turning house harkonnen into mostly disgusting blobs when i believe they were intended to be much more regal in nature in similar form to house atreides considering jessica was the daughter of baron harkonnen that blob issue doesnt really make sense the funny thing is a few months ago i listened to the dune audiobook i found the 1984 film pretty much followed the book in lock step all the way to the end save more description in the book and less details in the film the dl dune film did tell the vast majority of the dune story to completion without missing the major beats as for this updated film ive not yet seen it though i guarantee it will be compared to both the 1984 movie and 2000 tv miniseries versions whether it will be better is really a matter of opinion i actually liked the 1984 movie im probably one of the few who did the reason i liked it was its cerebral nature it required you to think through the plot even after the film was over in other words it took two or maybe three viewings before you got everything that was going on in the film there are a lot of subtle but important details throughout that film that are easily misunderstood our group was divided on dune the two guys who read the books liked it none of the girls did hate might be a better word the two guys who did not read the book kindasorta found it boring boring slow and pointless i suspect one reason the females didnt like it was the general treatment of females in that universe females in the dune universe are moreorless not treated as equals to the males the men hold the power the females are treated as servants concubines and forced into arranged marriages the female group which held any power in dune universe the bene gesserit were almost universally hated the bene gesserit were tolerated only because of their foreseeing abilities dune is a hard read to be sure however it doesnt help the way that the female gender is portrayed in the story material this situation also doesnt much improve in the later novels to be fair frank herbert completely avoids the damsel in distress theme throughout the dune novels at least the the ones ive read so far he instead treats the characters more matteroffactly and realistically meaning when alia goes insane because of her inability to handle her inherited memories she isnt treated as needing saving in fact its just the opposite they treat her as damaged goods instead she is effectively moved out of the way to minimize her damage her position of power within house atreides combined with her abilities does cause many to treat her with kid gloves but never as a damsel in distress
Jan 11 2022,positive, home  recommendation  films to watch  the bonus features accompanying denis villeneuves dune part one delight longtime fans while enriching the experience of the novice there are some works of science fiction that never seem to let go once they get their grasp on society william gibsons neuromancer was published in 1984 but it still felt just as vital and prescient when i read it in graduate school in the mid2000s in its exploration of humanitys interlocking life with technology it predates the wachowskis the matrix 1999 which is more widely known and is a film which clearly drew inspiration from gibsons novel ray bradburys fahrenheit 451 was published in 1953 yet the concepts of government control of what information should or shouldnt be accessed remains prevalent as senate bill 1142 is set to go into effect in the 20222023 school year a law allowing parents to report inappropriate library books and earn a fee if the books remain while the librarian will be punished as much as wed like not to panic in our quest to understand life the universe and everything the notions of these great forward thinkers linger in the air even more now than they did at the times of their writing enter frank herberts 1965 novel dune inspired by his observations of a conservation attempt along the oregon coastline he imagined a story of incredible fantasy that explored the intersection of nature tribalism and capitalism though attempts have been made to adapt this work none seem to have done so faithfully until denis villeneuve arrival blade runner 2049 with his 2021 release dune part one coming available on home video in the year 10191 the expansion of life has grown to the point of interplanetary travel throughout the universe and families overlooking entire planets as part of the new empire led by emperor shaddam corrino iv in order to achieve space travel safely at nearlight speeds the ships require a key ingredient called spice found on the harsh planet arrakis this planet has been overseen by house harkonnen for the last 80 yearsthat is until shaddam transferred control from baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård to house atreidess duke leto atreides oscar isaac whose family currently oversees the planet caladan under direct orders leto moves his people to arrakis including his companion lady jessica rebecca ferguson and their son paul timothée chalamet making plans to develop a partnership with the natives of arrakis known as fremen so that there can be harmony where house harkonnen used violence and discord to rule but while the house that manages spice production has the opportunity to earn untold riches letos more interested in how he can best serve those around him making him a formidable adversary in the emperors game of galactic chess lr rebecca ferguson as lady jessica atreides and oscar isaac as duke leto atreides in warner bros pictures and legendary pictures action adventure dune a warner bros pictures release having never read the book i will not be making a comparison between the two forms of the story what i will do is offer a perspective on the film through the lens of someone who is not already versed in the shakespearean tribulations that befall house atreides and the potential rise of paul atreides as the one lr director denis villeneuve and javier bardem on the set of warner bros pictures and legendary pictures action adventure dune a warner bros pictures release credit to villeneuve jon spaihts doctor strange and eric roth a star is born in adapting herbets work because this film is a meal and its not even complete most screenwriters attempt to make their stories as accessible as possible often using excessive exposition or taking additional steps to spell things out so that none in the audience are left behind for the most part villeneuve isnt interested in holding anyones hand in the film presenting things naturally for the characters placing them first above the audience this reverence is apparent throughout the film as characters discuss the faith system of the bene gesserit of which lady jessica is a member the prophecy of lisan al gaib translated to voice from the outer world that both the bene gesserit and arrakians believe in as well as just identifying but not explaining what a cyrsknife is the true significance of the gom jabbar sequence and many other moments if the prior sentence seemed like a word salad to an audience member without the reference point of the book thats what it feels like watching dune for the first time i say for the first time because despite the feeling of separation as one tries to navigate the political and personal relationships of the characters trying to understand the significance of some of the relationships to characters we barely spend time with and more we want to come back we want to understand villeneuve uses the full power of cinema to help connect relationships or intent so that even if we cant fully comprehend whats happening well know that it has meaning we just need to be patient to understand it for instance in an early scene where lady jessica is having breakfast with paul he asks for her to pass her some water and she tells him to use the voice they dont explain what it is but therere plenty of context clues between what is spoken the actors performances and what villeneuve shows us to understand whats happening as paul speaks and its more than chalamets voice thats heard speaking we can infer from the tight focus on paul that hes focusing we can infer some significance of the location as villeneuve jumps to objects of historical significance in the room and this allows us to consider that the voices we hear are the combination of paul and the people tied to those objects its a moment which implies that the training pauls receiving from his mother the way of the bene gesserit enables him to tap into his ancestors to use this gift did i make this realization on the first watch nope but i could feel it meant something gratefully it began to click with the second watch and the bonus features included with the home release confirmed it in more than one home release review ive praised bountiful bonus features and mourned the entire absence of them whether a brief featurette or a short film either of these enable the audience to learn something extra about a film they care enough about to purchase villeneuves dune part one offers a feast of materials that compliment that meal that is the film itself good bonus materials will enhance the experience of the film through new insights into the narrative or by offering behind the scenes details dune part one does both and includes materials which elaborate on content that readers of the novel are more likely to be aware of but that the movie didnt take the time to discuss because of this if you enjoyed the film but didnt read the book i recommend jumping into the bonus features before rewatching the film not only is it a joyous experience not sure ive ever seen so many cast and crew members absolutely giddy as they work or describe their work but its incredibly informative in the film lady jessica is dressed down by reverend mother mohiam charlotte rampling for having a boy when the bene gesserit are supposed to have girls creating a suggestion that lady jessica made a choice rather than the usual 5050 odds most parents face thanks to the twominute featurette filmbooks the bene gesserit i now know that members of the bene gesserit possess such control over their bodies that they are impervious to poison and can yes determine the genetics of their gestating children on first watch reverend mothers line could be taken as disappointment at the accident of paul but after watching the featurette its easy to see that theres more than disappointment theres frustration by lady jessicas purposeful action of giving birth to a boy this sets up a later reveal courtesy of pauls psychedelic spice trip that future lady jessica will join the fremen and become a leader within it displaying that while lady jessica is a loyal member of the bene gesserit she has her agency  reckless or thoughtful is to be determined details like this are all over the featurettes not just the filmbooks offering bits of insight that benefit the novel illiterate and the cinematically impressed if you reside in the latter make sure to check out each of the technical featurettes my personal favorites are designing the sandworm and a new soundscape as they overlap in their discussion of the sound design and mix present in the film for those who have seen the film youre aware of the thumpers used on arrakis to distract or attract the sandworms in designing the sandworm not only are you walked through the process of how the creature was designed for the film from a physical and a physics perspective but how they sound in this case its discussed how the sound of the thumper is intentional mimicking the sound paul hears when the sandworm speaks to him watching the film once the tool is merely understood as its explained to us the audience but with this additional information suddenly the arrikian tool transforms into something far more deliberate and thoughtful going further a new soundscape explores not only how to capture the sounds of the fictional arrakis but the sounds of dune itself pushing composer hans zimmer gladiator to find entirely new sounds and new instruments to create the score as youll learn in the bonus features both villeneuve and zimmer are enormous fans of the novel so they strove to make everything as unique as possible zimmer even mentions watching a certain popular space operaaction film that opened with french horns and when seeing it he wondered how humanity evolved so far away from us yet sounded just like us its not a denigration on that particularly famous and beloved score or auditory cue its an acknowledgement of how zimmer wanted to approach dune so that even the music felt unique and a bit foreign tidbits like this are strewn throughout the more than 71minutes of materials included on the 4k uhd bluray and digital editions keep in mind as you pick your home release edition that the bonus features may be included on these editions but the 4k uhd disc itself contains no materials you need access to the bluray or the digital edition to enjoy the bonus features the dvd edition only includes the eightminute the royal houses featurette lr directorcowriterproducer denis villeneuve and timothée chalamet on the set of warner bros pictures and legendary pictures action adventure dune a warner bros pictures and legendary release if youve seen the film theres a constant physicality to it that frequently makes the impossible feel as tangible as the device youre reading this review on part of that is the intricate detail in every aspect of patrice vermettes arrival production design and jacqueline west the revenant and robert morgans maleficent mistress of evil costume design as well as the fact that villeneuve purposefully built as much as was reasonable in order to make the performances as authentic as possible only then did he use cg so as to marry the physical and the digital to create plausible sequences that trick the mind into belief in the fiveminute featurette constructing the ornithopters its discussed in the process of designing the machines based on loose descriptions from the novel showing how the cast and crew used these physical objects in their scenes and then walking us through how the crew recorded helicopters to find the right camera angles so that they could then digitally replace them doing this may be a lot of work yet the results speak for themselves as not once does the camera go somewhere inauthentic to reality thereby supporting the illusion of cinema as great as the bonus materials are there is a small case of buyer beware that you should know about before deciding which version of the film to purchase for context ive seen the film in three forms first in 4k uhd streaming via hbo max there was no local press screening offered second in bluray on my 63in plasma and a third partial viewing in 4k uhd on my 43in 4k uhd television i mention this because anyone whos been a fan of dune the property or who followed the entertainment news ahead of the theatrical release is aware that villeneuve wasnt happy about the hbo max simulrelease because he felt his film should be seen in theaters its easy to be glib about this notion as covids variants continue to plague us and the capitalist response continues to hurt the social one right in line with dunes message amusingly but after enjoying all the bonus features theres a shift from viewing villeneuves desire for theateronly viewing as an elitist one toward an artists plea everything about dune part one is designed for the theater from the imax cameras to the sound design and score they knew that it would be viewed at home eventually but the aim was to create as immersive a theatrical experience as possible why does this matter now in revisiting the film via bluray i noticed that the more cgheavy scenes felt flat by comparison to my initial 4k streaming watch the lack of depth created even more distance between myself and the story even though i was more familiar with the material because i could sense the falseness in the art to its credit the home release mix is superb my 51 yamaha stereo producing immaculate sound even in its geriatric age which conveyed the otherworldliness that zimmer intended by contrast when i went back to the 4k uhd disc and watched several of the scenes that felt off the enhanced picture generated the sense of texture and depth which existed in my initial 4k streaming watch the sound coming through my far younger 51 yamaha sound system took full advantage of the truehd dolby sound mix convincingly making me feel as though as i traveling alongside paul on his journey of selfdiscovery in short if youre planning to purchase a copy and can watch it in 4k uhd thats the version you want anything short of that may result in a cinematic experience that wont live up to the vastness of dune dune is a narratively complex film if i felt like i was capable of writing about that complexity with any authority i would as i havent read the book and what villeneuve has given us is part one nothing i could write on its obvious correlation between global imperialism and the middle east capitalism and conservation would hold water and water is a precious resource instead all i can speak with any kind of certainty for now is that i want to see part two in order to complete the story and consider all its parts if youre interested in a deep dive of dune part one and havent read roxana hadadis article dune has a desert problem i cant recommend it enough that offered fascinating insights which i cant possibly fully comprehend until after villeneuve completes his adaptation but before i saw part one i possessed zero interest at all in the film now between a yearning to finish the story and hadadis insights part two has become an anticipated release in whichever form i am able to see it in
Jan 9 2022,positive, frank herberts dune is complex even that doesnt seem to communicate just how gigantic and seemingly convoluted the iconic book is david lynch famously adapted the 1965 novel into a feature film which isnt fondly remembered by anyone and alejandro jodorowsky also tried to adapt the book into a movie in the 70s but failed to complete the project dune has become notorious for being a difficult perhaps unfilmable piece of sciencefiction literature  the latest to tackle the challenge is denis villeneuve the director has already mastered complicated scifi with arrival and blade runner 2049 but can anything really prepare one to tell a story as massive as dune villeneuve has certainly given it his all and the end result is a visually ravishing but at times hollow film  dune follows paul atreides timothée chalamet the son of duke leto atreides oscar isaac who is moved to the planet arrakis paul has been plagued by strange visions of arrakis as well as a mysterious girl with blue eyes a characteristic of those who have lived on arrakis and ingested the planets valuable asset spice for a long time the house atreides are an easy target on the ruthless planet and soon they are betrayed leaving paul and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson at the mercy of the desert dune as expected looks great but looking good for a film of this scale feels like the bare minimum the real challenge of adapting dune is to make a coherent entertaining film that not only makes sense but never talks down to its audience and thats where villeneuve succeeds for the most part at least the first 30 minutes of the film is clumsy and expositionheavy there is simply so much to set up so much to cover that any filmmaker would buckle under that zendayas soothing voice guides us into the world of dune and introduces us to arrakis before we change to the point of view of paul  it takes a while for dune to get going once the script penned by eric roth jon spaihts and villeneuve gets past the inevitable introductions the story of political power struggles becomes compelling and dune is constantly a thrilling watch some of the attempted humour falls flat and dune takes itself way too seriously villeneuves world often lacks warmth and even humanity as characters come and go without distinct personalities or agenda arrakis might be scorching but dune is at times cold  villeneuves vision of dune is clear and surprisingly concise the story while gigantic in scale feels accessible and arrakis feels both ancient and futuristic its mostly made out of sand and stone and unlike most sciencefiction films dunes world is dirty and tangible close enough to ours to feel real but fantastical enough to provide a sense of utopia arrakis can get visually a little bland and repetitive but cinematographer greig fraser captures the sand dunes and vast desert impressively  the sound design of villeneuves film including hans zimmers monumental score is eardrumbursting sometimes needlessly so increased volume doesnt always guarantee a more immersive viewing experience and dune would be a stronger film if it didnt constantly try to outdo itself and be the biggest film of 2021 villeneuve confidently guides the story but often gets too lost in it and herberts detailed mythology and loses the sense of intimacy he works to build there are simply too many characters and too many actors all of whom are on fine form  all of villeneuves cast bring their agame chalamet is confident if at times comically brooding as paul paul isnt an easy role as hes often frustratingly emotionless like a blank slate but chalamet is typically watchable the films biggest surprises are rebecca ferguson and jason momoa momoa especially is delightfully relaxed here and this is the actors finest work to date ferguson gives a nuanced complex performance as lady jessica but most of the women in dune are magical and while powerful somehow lack agency  villeneuves dune isnt perfect but it is impressive its clearly only half a story  the title reads dune part one on screen  but even as such this is exciting work from one of the most assured visionary directors working in hollywood 
Jan 5 2022,positive, frank herberts dune which was originally serialized in the science fiction magazine analog between december 1963 and may 1965 before being published as a complete novel in 1965 has long been considered one of the cornerstones of modern science fiction literature which accounts for why there have been so many attempts to translate it to the screen despite its being widely considered unfilmable that unfilmable status of course is part of its allure offering up the ineffable of challenge of cinematically rendering herberts dense prose expansive narrative and heavy themes about power politics and messianic religion set 20000 years in the future  the chileanfrench provocateur alejandro jodoworsky was the first out of the gate in the early 1970s envisioning a singularly bizarre spectacle that had it ever made it out of development would have featured a score by pink floyd and a starring role for the surrealist artist salvador dali ridley scott fresh off the success of alien 1979 spent more than a year trying to bring it to fruition before abandoning it in favor of blade runner 1982 after which it was picked up by david lynch at the behest of megaproducer dino de laurentiis de laurentiis got more than he bargained for as lynchs innate weirdness and love of ambiguity ran headlong into the producers need for a viable commercial vehicle and the result was a critical and commercial flop vestiges of lynchs grandly weird and perverse original vision remain scattered throughout the film making it an experience that is both compelling and frustrating an enigmatic provocation that melds wild artfilm grotesquerie with poststar wars blockbuster ambitions sixteen years later the scifi channel produced a threepart miniseries in 2000 that was more faithful to herberts novel and was considered a success but the very fact that it gets so little mention attests to its ultimate lack of impact and into this cinematic maw now ventures denis villeneuve who is without doubt one of the most intriguing and compelling filmmakers working in the mainstream today although he first gained notice in hollywood with the tense violent crimeandpunishment dramas prisoners 2014 and sicario 2015 he has spent the past half decade working exclusively in the realm of heady science fiction which has seen a significant resurgence at the box office first with his elegant emotionally rending alien encounter drama arrival 2016 and then the long awaited sequel blade runner 2049 2017 villeneuves proficiency with both intimate human drama and largescale spectacle makes him an ideal candidate to tackle herberts epic which he and coscreenwriters jon spaihts prometheus passengers and eric roth a star is born forrest gump have wisely split in half a second dune film has already been announced thus ensuring that this one doesnt suffer the fate of ralph bakshis 1978 animated version of the lord of the rings which covered one and a half of tolkiens three books but wasnt successful enough to warrant a concluding film the general beats of the story will be familiar to those who have seen lynchs version full disclosure i have seen lynchs film at least a dozen times over the years have never seen the scifi channel miniseries and have not read any of herberts dune novels drawing on ancient epics and messianic religious myths dunes story unfolds in an emperorruled universe structured around a feudal system in which planets are controlled by various royal families there are two main rival housesthe atreides and the harkonnensthe latter of whom has been given the power to oversee the mining of the spice mélange a special substance found only on the desert plant arrakis also known as dune where nary a drop of rain falls and the surface provides cover for giant menacing sandworms the size of aircraft carriers spice is the most precious element in the universe because it expands the mind and allows for interstellar travel that would otherwise be impossible ruling over the two feuding houses is padishah emperor shaddam iv who unlike in previous adaptations is kept entirely offscreen here which renders him a shadowy and unknowable figure his primary machination is setting the atreides and the harkonnens directly against each other by allowing the atreides to take over spice production while secretly helping baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård and his nephew raban dave bautista plot a surprise attack with the help of the emperors army to destroy them the atreides are led by duke leto oscar isaac his concubine jessica rebecca ferguson and their son paul timothée chalamet jessica is a member of the bene gesserit a mystical female order that has been working for generations to produce the messianic figure known as lisan algaib which may very well be paul atreides while lynch was much more fascinated by the vile harkonnens with their physical grotesquerie and leering ambitions villeneuve pays decidedly more attention to the atreides who he presents as models of humanity in a universe of cutthroat imperialism duke letos treatment of javier bardems stilgar one of the leaders of the fremen the embattled native inhabitants of arrakis is telling of his fundamental decency and the fact that the fremen are cast almost entirely with people of color makes clear the films indebtedness to the realities of colonialism past and present  the problem however is that the weight of the films various subplots and narrative machinations leave only minimal room for character development which makes dune quite different from both arrival and blade runner 2049 both of which were as intriguing dramatically as they were visually villeneuve was smart to cast chalamet as the wouldbe messiahwarrior as his slight frame and narrow face remind us that he is as herbert envisioned him a teenager struggling under multiple burdens of expectation and troubling dreamsnamely the ones that prominently feature of a fremen woman named chani zendayathat he cant decipher however chalamets languid blankness often works against our investment in him which leaves us with few options for emotional engagement interestingly some of the peripheral characters namely josh brolins gurney halleck and jason momoas duncan idaho are more interesting and engaging primarily because they have energy and anger and determination chalamets paul starts to come into his own near the end which is of course the point but it makes the previous two hours slow going at times there are no issues however with the visual elements of villeneuves film which are just as stunning and engrossing as you might hope the digital effects blend seamlessly into the physical locations and sets producing a world that is entirely convincing and provides an attimes breathtaking backdrop for villeneuve and cinematographer greig frasers painterly compositions dune is a beautiful and austere film composed primarily of sand and rock and metal rarely is a primary color to be found villeneuve has an innate feel for the raw power of imagery and he infuses the film with numerous moments that captivate the eye whether it be the opening guerillastyle fremen attack in which they literally explode from the sand to the moment when baron harkonnens head slowly emerges from a vat of black oil like some creature from a horror film stellan skarsgårds corpulent physique bald head and slack face evoke nothing so much as marlon brandos abstruse kurtz in apocalypse now skarsgård plays the baron as the opposite of kenneth mcmillans take in lynchs version downplaying the bulgeeyed grotesquerie in favor of something more quiet and menacing which villeneuve emphasizes by often framing him out of focus in the background or at the edge of the frame thus even though dune isnt entirely successful on a dramatic level it has enough pull to draw us into its rich imagery and leave us wanting more its sudden ending evokes the the serialized nature of herberts novel while priming our hope something better is yet to come james kendrick offers exclusively on qnetwork over 2500 reviews on a wide range of films all films have a

Jan 4 2022,positive,dune gives us a reason to celebrate the art of the hollywood blockbuster for once instead of condemning it
Jan 2 2022,positive, you neednt be much of a musical fan to find emotional and spiritual nourishment in linmanuel mirandas feature directorial debut hinged so shrewdly on a topdrawer andrew garfield performance at once an adaptation of the late jonathan larsons stage musical of the same name and a poignant tribute to the mans curtailed life itself tick tick boom soars on the strength of mirandas tenacious visually dynamic direction the diverse and toetapping tunes and a wonderfully rambunctious lead turn from garfield for anyone whos ever looked at their contemporaries and thought that theyre just not doing enough with their lives mirandas film is sure to strike a mighty chord wrapping its overpowering existential throughline around what is at its core a testament to larsons takentoosoon artistic gifts michel franco dishes up another fascinatingly provocative drama  though not nearly as rabblerousing as his prior eattherich thriller new order  with this character study of a man tim roth who attempts to abandon his life and family while holidaying in acapulco francos second collaboration with roth after 2015s mesmerising chronic similarly asks a lot of audiences both to stick with it through its airier moments  despite an 83minute runtime  and to engage with subject matter that only becomes more discomforting as the pic wears on roth is typically excellent here digging deep into a character who internalises so much until incredibly late in the story while francos filmmaking yet again dares to contort the audience into some squirminducing positions clint bentleys directorial debut may not offer up much in the way of surprises but a familiar story well told can prove plenty entertaining in the right hands as is most certainly the case with jockey its always enormously gratifying to see an extremely talented character actor finally get the push into lead territory and here the opportunity arrived for the fantastic clifton collins jr who gives an outstanding oscarworthy performance as ageing horse jockey jackson silva laudably straightforward and unpretentious in both presentation and narrative jockey serves up just enough personal conflict without bogging itself down in treacly melodrama while offering a perspective into a quarter of the sports world fairly underserved by cinema as a whole denis villeneuves almost impossibly ambitious adaptation of the first half of frank herberts scifi opus dune is one of the most meticulously crafted and downright aweinspiring feats of blockbuster filmmaking ever made for this critics tastes it is certainly a film easier to respect than it is to love largely due to my own lack of emotional engagement with the story or characters  a problem i also had with the 84 lynch version  but so magnificent a feast is it aesthetically that its absolutely still a film i rush to recommend the battery of eyewateringly beautiful images and goosebumpsraising sounds combine with villeneuves holistic worldbuilding and a topdrawer cast to ensure that despite its sparseness of feeling dune carves out a space for itself in the annals of alltime visionary scifi movies dunes narrative may be a lot less interesting than everything else around it but theres little arguing with the mastery of the filmmaking on offer ramin bahrani rebounded from his massively disappointing fahrenheit 451 adaptation with his most ambitious piece of work yet  a terrific oscarnominated adaptation of aravind adigas 2008 novel the white tiger without giving much of its narrative chicanery away the plot centers around balram an excellent adarsh gourav who uses his wiles to lift himself out of the impoverished indian village where he was born the slumdog millionaire comparisons are inevitable and while bahranis film similarly slaloms between stark social realism and frothy genre fare this is far more concerned with indicting the indian caste system and our characters unfavourable place in it not a single living soul is going to watch steven soderberghs latest and call it anything but minor soderbergh but even the prolific directors evident offcuts usually prove to be more enthralling and entertaining than most filmmakers toptier work no sudden move is one such example a lowkey thriller elevated by the directors extreme formal control throughout the talents of an exceptional ensemble cast and some deliciously barbed dialogue yes the narrative is convoluted as is tradition for classic crime thrillers but the cast is clearly having such a good time chewing through it all that youd be forgiven for not really noticing or caring no sudden move is far from toptier soderbergh and even he would probably admit that but it nevertheless glides on an uncommon refreshingly calm rhythm for its genre lauren hadaway makes a scintillating a debut as writerdirector of this singular tale of pathological obsession following a college freshman isabelle fuhrman who joins her universitys rowing team with the overpowering goal of becoming the best of the best the novice could be glibly compared to whiplash but this drama  which through its intensity sometimes verges on psychological thriller  is really quite different eschewing a teacherstudent dynamic in favour of focusing on the shattering mental and physical toll of striving for 1 above all else if hadaways direction occasionally verges on heavyhanded  especially the recurring visual motif of a crab which has specific relevance in rowing nomenclature  for the most part she creates a bracingly intense visualaural landscape on which isabelle fuhrman delivers a stunning performance one which scored her a best female lead nomination at the independent spirit awards the humans might well be the most unnerving nonhorror film of the entire year a homefortheholidays thanksgiving psychodrama set largely inside a single new york city apartment as a fractured family unspools their various neuroses and traumas buoyed by a magnificent cast  especially a sublime richard jenkins  and karams eerie kubrickinspired framing and sound design this is perhaps cinemas purest recent distillation of how existentially horrifying yearend familial rituals truly can be its easy to see how karams unwieldy approach will turn many viewers off but the humans is one of the most tonally adventurous skincrawlingly uneasy films in recent memory daniel craigs longdelayed final sojourn as 007 didnt quite live up to the brilliance of casino royale or skyfall but it slid confidently into third place and in turn delivered a fitting shockingly emotional sendoff for craigs james bond if you can forgive rami maleks weak sauce villain and some needlessly convoluted story elements theres a remarkably wellcalibrated bond film to be enjoyed here braced between the triedandtrue globetrotting formula and a clear attempt to move the series forward with the times thanks to cary fukunagas electrifying direction and the efforts of cowriter phoebe wallerbridge to tidyup bonds sadly traditional sexism no time to die feels like an exciting nexus point for the ip that really anything could happen moving forward with craig giving fans the most cerebral visceral james bond portrayal to date its fitting that he went out in unexpected divisive and deeply moving fashion no time to die doesnt hit the highs of craigs best bond outings but takes some hard swings to challenge audience preconceptions of what the franchise can and cant do  and they mostly pay off a film you almost certainly wont see on any other top 50 list given its wildly divisive sundance reception erin vassilopoulos superior ambitiously expands her 2015 short of the same name into a daring headspinner of a feature debut without going into specifics  youll want to go into this one as cold as possible  superior follows a woman marian alessandra mesa who flees her abusive boyfriend and hunkers down with her identical twin sister vivian ani mesa what follows is a twisted heady riff on identity that borrows lovingly from the david lynch playbook albeit with its own grittyyetcolourful sense of style making the absolute most of the 16mm film it was shot on the mesa twins give outstanding performances in a film thats as playful as it is twisted constantly asking viewers to reassess their perception of events through the regular switcherooing of its two leads
Dec 31 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune is the type of epic filmmaking that many reach for and cant grasp full of emotional resonance and with the philosophical core of the book coursing through the films veins like lifeblood it puts other franchises to shame
Dec 24 2021,positive,these are complex dynamics its a reason why dune has been so tough to crack in this medium i think villeneuve has done it
Dec 23 2021,positive, the characters did not draw us into anythingit was all landscape and unheard whispers of a plotmaybe it would be better seen on the small screenwith pause and volume control but no were done
Dec 21 2021,positive,when the anticipation is feverish it sets up movies to disappoint and fail this longawaited movie smashes those expectations
Dec 21 2021,positive, last year i wrote about how hard it was to get two movie lovers to agree on a mutual top 10 this year in the spirit of the last duel sean fennessey and i decided to put our lists headtoheadyet we still didnt find room for the best ridley scott movie of the year which will only make sir ridley crankier the upshot of this exercise wasnt just to spotlight as many worthy movies as possible but to contrast different ideas about what constitutes cinematic value beyond taste even when there were instances of crossover in our lists we seemed to be coming at the films themselves from different angles nayman back in april i wondered whether anything would clear the bar set by rose glasss uncannily wellexecuted debut and unless you count the 40th anniversary rerelease and restoration of andrzej zulawskis magnificently messedup and terrifying possession no other horror movie came close however lets give a silver medal to james wans malignant for proving that the right way to spend all that aquaman collateral was on a movie about a sentient tumor in a moment when critics and fans are caught up in debating the phenomenon and cinematic vocabulary of elevated horror saint maud passed the audition as handcrafted highminded festival fare with big themes that didnt sacrifice scares its a beautifully made movie as finely embroidered and darkly enveloping as a funeral shroud and its carried by a heroic lead performance by morfydd clark as a woman whose belief that she can talk to god could be taken equally as delusions of grandeur or the pinnacle of humility glass knows how to ratchet tension but also how to let scenes breathe topping it all off saint maud sticks the landing with an ending that basically burns a hole through the screen ideally horror movies show us things we cant unsee glasss money shot has been living rentfree in my minds eye for months now sean fennessey adam i had a kid this yearour firstand its poisoned my movie brain where once i could a watch an endangered child onscreen and hardly bat an eyelash at the fictional terror now i recoil at even the suggestion of a little girl or boy in peril im a cliché dad prudish and fragile and thats ok with me for now but what i had not anticipated is how this can work in other directions in maggie gyllenhaals often unsettling adaptation of elena ferrantes novel she crafts a portrait of mothers at the end of their wits that is perceptive and relatable and fearless its a movie that withholds judgment but shows women constantly confronting the joy toll and simmering frustration of motherhood gyllenhaal is a firsttime writerdirector and hers is the most assured debut of the year anchored by four terrific performers olivia colman jessie buckley dakota johnson and dagmara domińczyk tasked with four visions of motherhoodone in repose one in retreat one in recalcitrance and one in anticipation im pairing it with cmon cmon another of mike millss gentle and episodic works of miniature opera after tackling his father 2011s beginners and his mother 2017s 20th century women mills is focusing on his child and his relationship to parenting he uses a proxy uncle character played with the recordflip softness that joaquin phoenix likes to break out after every joker or so to animate the parental love for a young boy pingponging between precocity and arrested development shot in gorgeously creamy black and white across la new york and new orleans its a movie not without scares or drama but ultimately warm and refreshingly free of guile it made me feel as good about this stage of my life as anything that isnt my daughter  nayman i also had a kid this yearbringing our households grand total to twowhich didnt so much poison my movie brain cant poison something thats already toxic but cut into my movieviewing time so significantly that ive missed enough key 2021 titles to make me wonder about making a list in the first place for instance i havent seen the lost daughter cmon cmon the tragedy of macbeth or ghostbusters afterlife how can i properly assess the year in cinema without ghostbusters afterlife the other wrinkle to having two kids is that even when i have managed to catch up with for your consideration stuff its largely been at home via dvds and screening links which is why im grateful that i actually saw the power of the dog in a movie theater where the exquisite widescreen compositions and stinging musical score could feel suitably overpowering so yes im adding my voice to the choral praise for jane campions latest not least of all because i cant remember watching a movie of this kindbig intricate and literary with a cleanly diagrammed structure and heavily underlined themes dial m for masculinitythat wrongfooted my expectations so deftly some critics were annoyed that it takes the plot a long time to kick in but thats not just good scenesetting by campionits a way to show that for some of the characters decisive action is a long time coming i liked the way that what seems to be an emotional triangle between two brothers and a woman keeps revealing new vertices and the last half hour is some of the greatest work yet from a filmmaker who plays havoc with expectations while honoring a larger and inexorable design  fennessey with two notable exceptions i saw every film on my list in a theatera privilege i appreciate and dont take for granted that includes hamaguchis epic tale of quiet contemplation a movie about a man constantly on the movein his vintage red saab 900but rarely able to move forward based on a rather terse haruki murakami short story hamaguchis rendition involves a theater actor and director channeling loss through a complex staging of uncle vanya that blends languages and symbols to cross cultures in hiroshima this is an audacious threehour movie that is by turns restrained and remote until an explosive finale that shifts the emotional turmoil from hidetoshi nishijimas theater director to his driver and companion played with a coiled power by tôko miura hamaguchis movie is beyond deliberateits a study in pace and unknowable truths but its mystery propels it forward to a feeling of autonavigation the sense that life keeps hurtling toward you even if you want to run from it better to have seen it without the distractions of a life at home and a second screen in reach instead let it drive right over you  nayman it was a great year for monsieur hamaguchi who also cowrote the no 8 movie on my listone directed by his old filmschool instructor the title of kiyoshi kurosawas wife of a spy is very it is what it is but starting with its brilliant bristling screenplay and expanding outward through its directors dexterous use of setting and shadow to evoke cloaked wartime motives the film is as complexly pleasurable as any prestige thriller of recent years statuesque satoko yu aoi is an actress married to successful importerexporter yusaku issey takahashi whose movements between japan and manchuria have piqued the interest of kobes local authorities when a woman in yusakus circle turns up dead she gets suspicious too the chess board that kurosawa keeps returning to in a series of symbolic closeups summarizes the movecountermove machinations of the plot but what kurosawa and his collaborators are really up to is more of a meditation on roles and performance the devastating revelation of what yusaku is really keeping hiddenor perhaps trying to exposeputs a political frame around the action while calling back to the apocalyptic horrors of kurosawas previous genre masterpieces superfans like myself can enjoy the shoutouts to cure and charisma while those unfamiliar kurosawas cinema will simply recognize the touch of an old master  fennessey theres an awkward twostep happening in the dance of film discourse swaying left to blindly stan actors and filmmakers no matter their cultural output or depth and then swaying back right to adjudicate the moral and political valences of art above intention or its absence movies are denounced before release based on a plot synopsis or ferociously defended in the face of criticism into this freeforall parachutes red rocket what to make of it a gimleteyed portrait of a suitcase pimp returning home to texas city texas after a couple of decades working as a porn star in la bakers movie at first feels like a provocation his star simon rex is an exmtv vj alum of the scary movie series and a posteminem shock rapper he has a rubbery face and a whirling dervish spirit all limbs and teeth and weathered skin his character mikey saber wields a hustle that is cheery and destructive he grooms young women sells drugs deceives his wife and brags about it all to his lone friend hes disgusting and yet charming some of that is rex who is pure gogogo and some of that is the way baker situates the character in a decrepit world where survival feels more important than decency saber is puerile but funny and ruthlessly determinedhis story feels like a soft projection of all the hucksters and groping assholes whove blown into our political and social lives these past five 50 years  but is saber really a standin for donald trump that feels too elementary and doesnt do justice to the psychologically layered construction of the character who desperately tries to win the audience any audience over even as he burns the world around him baker sets the antic pacing and boundarychallenging vim of italian comedy against a gorgeously elegiac vision of a dying american center in the film a doughnut shop operates in the shadow of an oil refineryim not sure theres a better metaphor for this country and while baker doesnt judge his characters even when theyre monstrous hes manifested a unique confrontation for audiences and perhaps the dreaded discourse too what to do with a problem like mikey saber get a close look at him maybe even hear him out just dont stan him  nayman just dont stan himthe eternal conundrum when it comes to m night shyamalan who arguably makes it easier on his haters than any major working american director even as he preaches blissfully to the choir back in july i called nights mystery about yes a beach that makes you old  a big swing that makes contacta reference to the ohshit revelation in signs that the only thing standing between earth and an alien takeover was joaquin phoenix and his trusty wonderbat twenty years later shyamalan has lived down his reputation as a twistmonger and hes regrouped by taking and matching the pulse of a zeitgeist that had seemed to pass him by the visit found a genuinely inventive way to use found footage postparanormal activity split and glass simultaneously satirized and cashed in on the superhero cinematic universe trend old meanwhile takes on such trenchant contemporary issues as the surveillance state predatory pharmaceutical companies and top 40 rappers called midsized sedan the moment when mr sedan aaron pierre was identified as such by an ardent teenage fan was also the moment when old won my heart and im not likely to give it back anytime soon in a period when even interesting filmmakers seem content to simply produce content shyamalan seems committed to keeping it weird thanks for the laughs night and maybe you know hit me back  just to chat truly yours your biggest fan etc fennessey this was quite a good year for directorial autofiction joanna hogg completed her memoiristic the souvenir diptych with a righteous glee janicza bravos zola transposed the ohshit virality of a strippers twitter thread onto a larcenous fairy tale of cultural identity david lowerys the green knight quested to the heart of his greatest fear only to discover a whole lot of cowardice and some resolve too wes anderson even made a movie about a visionary curator wrangling all of his charges to create something bigger than all of them directors like to see themselves in their stories in case you hadnt heard or asked m night shyamalan nowhere was that more evident or vital than in the french filmmaker mia hansenløves bergman island a skilled chronicler of millennial ennui and quiet longing hansenløve takes her story of a husbandwife pair of filmmakers a perfectly cast tim roth and vicky krieps finally rewarded with a worthy followup to phantom thread to the swedish island of fårö where ingmar bergman lived worked and died in another directors hands this might amount to hoary homage but this is a mashup of moviewithinmovie nesting doll symbolism with hansenløve creating an unofficial followup to her 2011 film goodbye first love and unraveling our expectations of conventional narrative in the process when mia wasikowska and anders danielsen lie arrive as exes reunited at a wedding more than halfway through the film it transforms into something sensual but selfabnegating you can almost hear hansenløve asking herself is this a good idea few directors are willing to work out their feelings out loud and bergman island is not a movie with thunderous conclusions but it has something that few examples of autofiction can claim humility nayman you left out one key guy in your inventory of visceral autofiction say bonjour to leos carax whose chaotic seriocomic rock opera annette is among other things a selfportrait of the artistby the final scene the wan pencilmustachioed adam driver this years best actor has become the spitting image of his director i cant say i found annettes mix of amour fou fatal melodrama puppet theatre and popcultural pastiche completely successful or convincing but no movie this year had higher highs beginning with the opening fullcompany singalong that winkingly begs the audiences permission to let the festivities commence and peaking during a final duet between driver and the titular child star that somehow echoes both robert bresson and pinocchio is drivers caustic bill hicks routine as the ape of god tough to sit through yes do all those pounding tinny sparks songs grow tiring after a while sure does annette come out the other side of its annoyances and score the kind of bold emotional coup we expect from the greatest movie musicals for me it did  fennessey forgive the doubleup but i dont know how i could refuse consider the archival music documentary in which hardly any archival footage of the subject exists that was the challenge haynes conquered in his velvet underground film adopting the ecstatic visual style of an andy warhol picture and the spelunking delight of an academic deep in his thesis to render a story about one of the more iconic if not chronicled bands of the 20th century and the new york artistic underground swelling around it his velvet underground movie is downright electrifying like watching culture get born in a tiny circle of noise  nayman the same late60s spirit of get back and the velvet underground haunts ephraim asilis ingenious collectivist comedy the inheritance whose characters are attempting to uphold revolutionary ideals in a modern context we are a shoeless home explains one of the inhabitants of the house of ubuntu a residence modelled after and located nearby the west philadelphia move commune that was made infamous in 1985 by a fatal and ulimately unpunished police bombing the line is resonant in the sense that asilis characters are trying to follow in the footsteps of the past principled intellectual 20something julian eric lockley has inherited the house from his late grandmother and filled it with friends colleagues and hangerson committed to studying a treasure trove of artifacts that taken together comprise a syllabus of modern africanamerican artistry and activism books magazines records sculptures murals manifestos partially based on his own experiences in a black marxist collective and brimming with affectionately selfdeprecating dialogue asilis film serves doubly as a showcase for julians hallowed texts and a sly formally rigorous satire on the paradoxical compromises of group livingthe way that even ideological solidarity cant prevent people from getting on one anothers nerves  fennessey i made a pact with myself a long time ago that when paul schrader adds another wounded creature to his menagerie of gods lonely men i will abide with its inclusion on a yearend list this is made a bit easier when the films assume the same sense of grace and despair as 2018s first reformedthis years entry the card counter does just that his latest examination of alienation soul death and the american lie follows a onetime abu ghraib prison guardtorturer named william tell ha haunted by his past and seeking to escape one full house at a time via the roadside casinos of these united states oscar isaac with his boxy good looks and hooded stare is a schrader monk par excellence when he stumbles upon a young guy tye sheridan wormish looking to avenge his fathers death tell is forced to face down his trauma this is not a subtle film and not a terribly good gambling movie but there is a psychic blankness in the performancesascetic control trumping actorly vanitythat had me once again plumbing the depths of the torture cell schrader calls his brain i can count on one hand the number of filmmakers who are capable of ripping out the insulation of our daily lives and dragging it into view for everyone to wince at schrader is 75 years old and his social media presence suggests a somewhat loony crank but i hope hes got a few more films in him as our pals on the press box podcast like to joke the old guys still got it nayman speaking of old guys whove still got it paul verhoeven takes pole position amongst 2021s octogenarian success stories as much as i enjoyed both the last duel and cry macho neither ridley scott nor clint eastwood can claim to be working from a position of industrial weakness theyre playing with house money while like schrader verhoeven has to try to game the system every time out hes currently in his third decade of professional exile from the usa and since refashioning himself as a classy classical arthouse filmmaker hes made a few of the best movies of his brilliantly checkered career five years ago the viciously terrific thriller elle sniffed the oscar race now comes this deceptively sleazy intellectually searching factbased period piece about a nun experiencing mystic visions in 17th century italy what do you do with a problem like benedetta as played by the superlative virginie efira verhoevens heroine is a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigmashe claims to have a direct line to god and one of the fringe benefits of her successful power grab at the local abbey is that she gets a private room to hook up with her fellow sister bartolomea having been taught from a young age to hate her body suddenly shes loving it is she a faker an opportunist a rebel with a cause or does the lord work in mysterious ways certainly verhoeven does mixing lurid cynical exploitation with fluid storytelling and the principled irreverence of a satirist whose art always punches up against institutional dogma and scores a knockouthopefully not for the last time fennessey if the beatles felt so big that they could not be confined to anything less than 468 minutes imagine how long a film that purports to untangle the hidden connections that link national myths artificial intelligence collectivist fallacies imperialism chinas cultural revolution and 2pac should be at least 10 minutes longer according to adam curtis who has been creating overwhelming recombinant visions of our cursed past and paranoid future for the bbc for the better part of four decades his latest is his biggest widest and chewiesta tapestry of conspiracy theory lawyerly evidentiary presentation archival wizardry and curtiss trademark needle drops blended together across nearly eight hours cant get you out of my head remains my definitive document of quarantine powerwatching the film has not officially been released in the united states though it can be seen on youtube i subjected my thenpregnant wife to the experience over two typically isolated days this winter and while i cant say this is the kind of uplifting material youd like to view as you prepare to bring life into the world i remain tantalized by curtiss style and mission are some of his conclusions bigbrained leaps of logic perhaps but you dont have to be convinced of anything beyond curtiss utter commitment to his truth in less skilled hands youd have well a bad youtube documentary and maybe this is merely the steroidal version of subgenre that has wrought havoc on the minds of millions over the past decade but curtiss deeply researched literate and cosmic sense of events suggests a world not of individual moments but a star system flashes of light that when connected create a constellation of existence  nayman the protagonist of azor likes to give assurances on assignment in buenos aires circa 1980 representing a highend swiss bank yvan fabrizio rongione tells his clients that their money is safe but the country is edging towards economic and political chaos and yvans boss and colleague mr keys is nowhere to be found in a moment where argentinas ruling powers are known for disappearing anybody inconvenient to the regime the missingperson subplot gives azor a thriller hook but beyond the machinations of its plot the film achieves a kind of ambient creepiness in which every encounter no matter how refined or banal seems to point to sinister intentions the films darkhued painterly images evoke new hollywood thrillers like chinatown and night moves and as in those films its as if reality were rotting from the inside out its a fine line between subtlety and stasis and azors slowburn may be challenging for viewers who crave more consistent stimulation but if marinating in paranoia is your idea of a good time fontanas beautifully executed debut is as good as it gets fennessey sometimes bigger is better goddamnit this was a lousy year for conventional blockbusters and i typically like to find one or two a year that rises to the level of visceral joy that only a shiny noisy hollywood production can create im not sure dune is a joyful filmthat isnt quite villeneuves registerbut i was transported by his adaptation of frank herberts beloved oftadaptedbutnevernailed novel the ambition and scope is invigorating a longtime passion project this is a movie where a filmmaker is attacking the source material head on with respect admiration and a visionary craftsmanship that perhaps even its author didnt know was possible when he was writing herberts novel is a psychotronic tangle of heady imagery and the film strips away the haze to focus on the arid desperation and religiosity of its characters without sacrificing the grandeur of sandworms thopters and the slug majesty of its villain baron harkonnen hollywood is going through a difficult transitional period with regard to bigbudget moviesif it aint mcudceufast it aint a sure thing unlessunlesswe entrust hundreds of millions of dollars to blindly driven auteurs adapting books they have loved since adolescence roger ebert once wrote that movie theaters unashamedly provided a proscenium for our dreams in dune villeneuve dreams big and boldly uses the voice go to sleep nayman ive already written some thoughts on ptas freewheeling teen comedy the only thing i want to add in this yearend context is that of all the toptier auteurs whove released new work in 2021 anderson seems to have been the most inspired by shooting under limited conditions part of whats so beguiling about licorice pizza is how it seems to take place in a world where grownups arent really aroundthe san fernando valley circa 1973 becomes a playground for characters on the verge of maturity whether growing up too quickly or not soon enough the slightly uncanny quality of the location shooting can be chalked up to the directors mandate to shoot closer to home including some family cameos but the vibes arent wholly cozy or nostalgic amidst all the hijinks theres a feeling of encroaching crisis or maybe a bubble about to burst time keeps on slipping throughout licorice pizza faster and faster and anderson and his everagile camera take it in stride this is filmmaking that doesnt break a sweat  fennessey i have clear and undistorted memories of critical decisionmaking points in my late 20s and early 30s take this job move to this city befriend this person go to that party maybe pack it in tonight three whiskeys is enough sir i live a more domesticated life these days often homebound and unambitious but occasionally i will think back on some of those choices did i miss out on meeting someone at that party who could have changed it all for me or have i played the notes of life as well as possible i definitely blew it on more than one occasion but im happy and healthy and  well this all sounds like rationalization doesnt it what youre reading right now is solipsism and im far from above it most people born after 1980 at least arent either joachim trier understands this in the final third of his oslo trilogy the norwegian director trains his eye on julie an intelligent vivacious young woman who frequently seems to make the wrong choice theyre not cataclysmic decisions but anytime a relationship or a career path makes some headway in her psyche she flees renate reinsve plays julie in what i believe is the performance of the year as a woman with a deeply millennial sense of false bravadoshes a person roiling with feelings and beliefs but harboring selfdoubt and confusion at every turn i recognize julie if i am not her i have met her worked with her had zoom calls with her while she blithely presented her grand vision of the world to me it is the confidence and passion of a person who was told that she can be anything she wants colliding with the reality that maybe just maybe she can trier and cowriter eskil vogt have an uncanny feel for this conundrum crafting the movie into 12 discrete parts a selfconsciously novelistic approach that does in fact reflect how people tend to recall their youth this movie knocked me over everyone should see it nayman sean you already very accurately described drive my car as a movie that cruises right over you and i know its a bit cliché at this point to roll over for ryusuke hamaguchi but the guy is just such a controlled intelligent filmmaker and hes on a hot streak where drive my car chugs along with brilliant linearityleaping across weeks and years to chronicle an artists struggle to turn grief into inspirationwheel of fortune and fantasy turns curlicues about chance fate and heartbreak its made up of three miniature 40minute dramas each featuring sexy existentially angsty characters each with a delicious twist each whirling away in succession one after another like a perfect little anthology of short stories no movies this year took more pleasure in the architecture and engineering of narrative and no matter how precarious and intricate the structures get they hold up with drive my cars chassis reinforced by chekhov and wheel of fortune and fantasy dipping into speculative sciencefiction in a finale that moved me more than anything else i saw all year  fennessey anyone who has read or listened to me over the years knows that paul thomas anderson is my favorite filmmaker ill admit i sometimes struggle to put to words why i remain ensnared by his films i think the word is ineffable of course hes a master filmmakerhes seen it all and knows what he likes but what do i like perhaps its the overweening sense of intensity meeting the sneeringly hilarious disposition of his characters there are times when i look at people and i see nothing worth liking maybe its the absolute delight he takes in capturing his characters in motion its possible we share a sense of humor and his frequency is coming over the airwaves loud and clear to me he makes movies that feel important but i think thats a feint what we want from artists is purely individualized expressionpta makes movies only he can make licorice pizza feels like a perfectly reconstructed memory like someone hopped in a time machine and brought a 35mm camera which is not to say its a documentaryit has all the clever setups brisk editing and euphoric climaxes of great filmmaking like hal ashby got lost in the valley and pulled over for a bite he gets remarkable performances from cooper hoffman and alana haim two firsttime actors representing the sensation of infatuation if not consummation he selects songs impeccably as if touched by john peel he shoots la like its babylon a place where people are born and eventually entombed in the glorious dumb history of this company town licorice pizza is a showbiz movie about all the reckless dangerous ghouls who haunted the industry and also a pieeyed picture of kids just trying to make something of themselves its hard to describe why i loved it but i know that i did
Dec 19 2021,negative, directed by denis villeneuve dune part one follows timothée chalamets paul atreides as hes forced to embrace his destiny as the leader of his family and an entire race of people filmmaker villeneuve working from a script written with jon spaihts and eric roth delivers a fairly faithful adaptation that is for the most part visually impressive yet dramatically inert as the movie much like its source material suffers from an armslength feel thats exacerbated and perpetuated by an emphasis on dull onedimensional characters and dialogueheavy sequences transpiring predominantly within dimlylit environs  with the farfromenthralling atmosphere preventing the viewer from working up much interest in or enthusiasm for the protagonists deliberatelypaced exploits its clear consequently that villeneuves largerthanlife approach doesnt fare nearly as well as one mightve hoped or anticipated as the pictures myriad of meticulouslycrafted setpieces are unable generally speaking to pack the exciting visceral punch for which the filmmaker is obviously striving ie the movie is ultimately big on spectacle but frustratingly short on everything else by the time the nigh endless third act rolls around dune part one has cemented its place as a distressing misfire that seems to confirm that frank herberts 1965 novel is just not suitable for bigscreen treatment ie dune part one and david lynchs dune are about on the same level in terms of entertainment value
Dec 17 2021,positive, dune has been built up as a potential turning point of 2021 cinema since its premiere at the venice film festival in the weeks since its release in october simultaneously in cinemas and on hbo max that chatter has accelerated in the wake of a successful boxoffice haul the confirmation of a sequel and predictions and concerns about the current state of western cinema dune feels momentous that momentousness is not all for good and not all in good faith but dune has become as is the case with films of this kind something of a symbol for things that exist beyond it when i say films of this kind i dont mean sciencefiction  but commercially successful films theres a lot thats hanging on dune and whether it becomes a success not just a potential sequel but depending on who you talk to it portends so much more it could be a signifier of the ubiquity of timothee chalamet who is headlining two major films this year from two very different directors it could be a signifier of the future of sciencefiction adaptations it could be a signifier of what kinds of texts are adapted and readapted to the big screen and it could be a signifier of the still complicated question about cultural representation and appropriation on the big screen dune is many things to many people which makes sense for a film that announces itself as an epic with very big ideas but also because this is a film based on a novel that comes loaded with swathes of context and consideration that exist way beyond director denis villeneuve in spite of that context i went into dune eerily ignorant of any it its more happenstance than deliberate avoidance but my knowledge of frank herberts novel 1965 the david lynch film 1984 or the john harrison miniseries 2000 was scant my fledgling interest in the new adaptation was predicated more on my interest in villeneuves work as a director more than any firm opinion on the source itself i managed to see dune without even seeing a trailer my entrypoint to this story was filtered through the lens of villeneuve its only in the days since seeing the film that ive waded into the context the complications the ellipses and the tensions of that work and in thinking about dune  the film and the mythos  considering the contexts feels like its own adjunct to the filmmaking the film takes place sometime in the very distant future where humanity has regressed emotionally while prospering scientifically earth is not the centre of this nebulous future and although its some time before we understand quite where we are we come to recognise that a sandy planet arrakis is central to this an imperial family the atreides are caught up in this intrigue the artreides patriarch oscar isaac is a noble ruler his son paul chalamet is callow and uncertain but potentially heroic pauls mother jessica rebecca ferguson is mysterious and potentially powerful its a science fiction text with explicitly realised tropes you understand who everyone is from early on the wise advisor to paul the unnerving olderwoman whos up to something the female ingenue that will complicate pauls journey we know these kinds of worlds even if we dont know this world the desert planet becomes a topic of concern for the main players desperate for its wealth of spice and soon an attempt at extraction becomes a game of political subterfuge its not so much that plot isnt important to dune so much that the plot isnt necessarily built on twists that are out of line with our understanding of these kinds of stories the most significant narrative concern is pauls potential role as a messiah figure who might be able to put an end to the worst of the world by following his destiny in this first part of the novel this is all more set up than follow through as villeneuve invites us into the world and its here that dune is notably exemplary a lot of this is on cinematographer greig fraser who is conjuring grandiosity mood and tension in his collaboration with production designer patrice vermette dune looks good and the stills of it going around the internet echo that  even better though is the way it sounds a genuine recurring note of dread and anxiety pulsating throughout with some chilling work from sound designer mark mangini its a technical wonder and even if its detractors argue that its style with no substance it feels like the style is the substance when the main preoccupation is a world that seems to seduce these characters it was curious providence that i was thinking of dune in the same week that the cave hill campus in barbados was holding the west indian literature conference the topic of caribbean science fiction emerged during the conversation the contours of western and mostly white sciencefiction the way that historically science fiction has been regressive on issues of race and gender why is it that futuristics imaginings are so limited by ideas of race a number of major releases over the next few months are adaptations of preexisting material some of the original texts are decades old thinking of adaptation studies as a field and the relationship between source and adaptation feels critical right now can adaptations really transcend their source can they ethically address issues that create complications today which works do we adapt and why do we adapt them these are questions beyond dune and that dune has fostered a return to this conversation is beneficial even if like so much about dune it is complicated reading herberts issue with race into villeneuves dune or reading them out villeneuves dune is a complicated venture denis villeneuve is intentional about his filmmaking but he cannot be a director onto himself and he knows this after all his recent blade runner 2049 attempted another complicated task of outrunning the shadow of the past with his sequel to ridley scotts blade runner i need to sit with the contours of dune i am moved and haunted by its formal sharpness the sand the shots the music i can marvel at the sharp precision of hans zimmers score even as i wonder at the use of ululations in a film that seems still cagey at really embracing with arabic culture but then this is a future world our contemporaneous cultures dont exist in the future but they exist now and even if dune is set in the then it exists in the now how do we wrestle with those paradoxes im not sure dune has the answers for that and its probably too much for a single film to answer villeneuves control of this world and the sharp precision is wholly compelling enough so that the sheer scope and power of the spectacle feels enough my ignorance of the context of dune became a boon for me but with the recent announcement of the sequel one wonders what the future of dune might look if we engaged those queries what kind of futures can we imagine for sciencefiction
Dec 16 2021,positive, since it was first published in 1965 frank herberts epic scifi novel has had quite a shelflife as well asdeep breath nowfive herbertpenned sequels theres a series of prequelssequels cowritten by his son a bad 1984 film directed by david lynch an indifferent 2000 miniseries even a 1983 iron maiden song called to tame a land because herbert wouldnt let them use the title like herbert writerdirector denis villeneuve is great at worldbuilding although his narratives sometimes run away from himsee blade runner 2049 could he be the one to finally tame the material the first step he and cowriters jon spaihts and eric roth made was to cut the novel in halfa bold move seeing as a sequel isnt yet guaranteed still with part one running at a bladderstraining 155 minutes they probably could have gone for a trilogy in the future the stewardship of the desert planet arrakis is passed from house harkonnen aka the baddies led by baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgard to house atreides the goodies led by leto atreides oscar isaac this takes letos familyincluding young paul timothy chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson whos only 12 years older than chalametto arrakis where they must win the hearts and minds of the local fremen people led by stilgar javier bardem all this while mining a valuable hallucinogen known as spice and avoiding huge marauding sand worms lawrence of arabia never had it so tough put simply its your commonorgarden hero narrative with chalamet as a jesusluke skywalkerneo figure slowly realising his power in the face of interplanetary tyranny if its a little speechy and slow to begin with at least herberts words are brought to life by a worldclass cast including josh brolin jason momoa charlotte rampling dave bautista and zendaya but its villeneuve and his crew that really dazzle australian cinematographer greig fraser is an expert at capturing extraordinary landscapes zero dark thirty lion the mandalorian and some of the shots in dune are so beautiful that a certain type of bachelor will want to frame them and put them on his wallmake love to them hans zimmers suretobeoscarwinning score which swells from rumbling bass to clamorous whispers to the mangled wail of a bagpipe gives proceedings a suitably stirring heft as anyone whos seen sicario or incendies knows villeneuve is one hell of a director and he directs the hell out of this creating moments of spellbinding spectacle such as the atreides huge spaceship emerging whalelike from roiling seas or the sky over arrakis split by fire as the harkonnens attack sending paul and lady jessica out into the desert badlands occasionally the material does feel a little overly familiar aside from the baron himself who rubs his head a la colonel kurtz marlon brando in apocalypse now and thrillingly can levitate the harkonnens are the kind of generic goth baldies weve seen a hundred times before in the likes of dark city the fremen meanwhile are often cast as cliched mystical natives which isnt helped by the eruptions of indigenous wailing on the soundtrack but the main reason for this overfamiliarity is that filmmakers have been ripping off dune for years star wars for instance borrowed its desert planet and visionary teen turning the sandworms into a sarlacc pit no wonder herbert was so touchy about protecting his ip although fatigue sets in just before the endat which point we are informed frustratingly that this is only the beginningvilleneuve has achieved something beyond an impressive adaptation with streaming taking over the world and the future of cinema at stake his is a vision so huge so overwhelming that it demands to be seen on an imaxsized screen so it can swallow you whole like some kind of subterranean invertebrate dune may not be for everyone but what it has in spades is an unshakable belief in its own worldbuilding from a drop of sweat trickling down the ear of a desert rodent to the massive shimmering tsunamis of sand now how about that sequel
Dec 16 2021,neutral, dune the muchhyped new film adaptation of frank herberts classic scifi novel starring timothée chalamet and zendaya finally heaves its bulk into cinemas this week kicking up a cloud of dust  and not much else the dystopian blockbuster has gone all out to impress with its popular source material a wellregarded director blade runner 2049s denis villeneuve and an impressive cast also featuring oscar isaac jason momoa dave bautista rebecca ferguson josh brolin and javier bardem but somehow it still commits the ultimate cinematic sin of being well a bit boring chalamet stars as paul atreides son of a powerful duke isaac in the far future of humanity who is given the stewardship of the dangerous and unforgiving desert planet arrakis aka dune the planet for all its difficult conditions  including giant sandworms its hostile native people the fremen and the necessity of wearing suits that recycle sweat yum  also yields the precious substance spice the properties of which extend human life and make fasterthanlight travel possible  however the planets previous stewards the harkonnen led by stellan skarsgårds grotesquely fleshy baron vladimir are not willing to let go of arrakis riches without a fight meanwhile paul is haunted by visions of the future including that of fremen girl chani zendaya as he exercises special powers encouraged by his mother lady jessica ferguson a member of the bene gesserit group who train their bodies and minds to achieve superhuman abilities so far so scifi standard  but semientertaining however dunes key issue is its pacing with every one of the films two hours and 35 minutes seemingly stretched out with not quite as much plot as you would expect to fill them the buildup to the storys major action takes almost the entirety of this movie with a dune part two confidently referenced although not yet confirmed with the slow pace although the film is nicely shot by greig fraser at times its hard to escape the overpowering sense of it really just being an awful lot of dust and quite a few sandworms bursts of action and plot give a glimpse at the exciting epic that dune could have been the whole way through but it doesnt help with the movies dryness when theyre lacking for a film that takes its sweet time setting out its premise its also frustratingly short on some contextual detail such as more on the mysterious bene gesserit and the reasoning behind lady jessicas overall mode of fraught although that would have made the film indeterminately longer so maybe not dune is not particularly helped by its harsh soundtrack either courtesy of hans zimmer which is a lot of similarsounding futuristic crashbangwallop that seems to repeat on a loop ready to indicate moments of high tension  even if nothing much ends up happening one undeniable plus of dune is its cast with every performer committed to giving of their all despite a general lack of zing in the script to help the film rise above other nondescript standard scifi fare chalamet proves a strong and convincing lead as paul a slightly uneasy young man forced to grapple with his future as a leader  in more ways than one jason momoa injects some muchneeded humour as the gungho duncan idaho also playing noble soldier to a t in more sombre moments sharon duncan brewster is also a standout as a genderswapped dr liet kynes a complex ally to house atreides on arrakis as an imperial planetary ecologist and also a fremen and a warning for zendaya fans  she only properly appears in the movies final 10 minutes dune is so obviously gunning for its second part that villeneuve has rather let that ambition play havoc with this films content and pace its tough to know whether to reward that with a sequel or not although audiences are likely to be invested in a hopeful payoff of more action in part two keen fans of herberts source novel will likely find more to enjoy in the series getting a refreshed cinematic outing after david lynchs 1984 version but for others its hard to escape dune feeling very slow and very dry as a scifi if youve got a celebrity story video or pictures get in touch with the metrocouk entertainment team by emailing us celebtipsmetrocouk calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our submit stuff page  wed love to hear from you
Dec 10 2021,positive, the extraordinary story the epic visual feast and the sheer immersive scale and majesty of it all on the big screen then theres a stonecold unfathomably flawless cast the hans zimmer score and the gifted maestro denis villeneuve orchestrating it all from the directors chair from the frank herbert novel we are transported to a universe ruled by those who control the one commodity they cannot live without  spice the house of atreides are sent to govern including the enigmatic son of the duke paul atreides fuelled by his mysterious dreams and on the cusp of uncovering his powers
Dec 7 2021,positive, when i was a child i had deeply disturbing dreams of vastness like my unconscious mind was tapping into the sheer unfathomable scale of the universe the entire sweep of not just geological but celestial time and the dim awareness of how small and finite i was when set against all that was terrifying it was all very abstract there were no concrete images that i can now recall only the impressionistic sense of huge unknowable shapes moving perhaps rotating in yawning space and my insectile flawed apprehension of something absolutely beyond my minds ability to fully and accurately encompass maybe that doesnt sound like much written down but it was annihilatingly horrifying at the time enough to jolt me awake in a welter of uncomprehending and fearful tears more than once i remember one time i was out the front door through the front gate and halfway down the street in the middle of the night before i recovered myself enough to return barefoot and shaken to my bed now dune  in any of its varied forms  isnt exactly about that but its a little bit about it its about finite lives lived in infinite space and time its about free will and prophecy destiny and what hardcore historys dan carlin calls the two schools of history the trends and forces school where vast and largely rudderless social and economic movements combined with preexisting conditions shape the course of our existence and the great man school which puts the blame squarely on charismatic movers and shakers  your adolph hitlers your napoleon bonapartes your paul atreideses its about colonialism and imperialism and oil and the new film adaptation by denis villeneuve handles those themes better than any other iteration thus far even if it still doesnt quite thread the needle but what villeneuve does exceedingly well is at least touch on that vastness that scared me half to death as a little kid sense of scale is an interesting thing in science fiction and its far better communicated visually than in prose you could argue with no small amount of justification that the key image in modern science fiction is that first shot of the star destroyer in pursuit of the rebel blockade runner in the original star wars 1977 how the imperial ship looms into the frame seemingly from behind us and just keeps coming an enormous metal sperm whale running down a minnow gareth edwards who already had monsters 2010 and godzilla 2014 under his belt at the time got a similar if less iconic effect in 2016s rogue one with the shot of the death stars super laser dish being lowered into place the king of this sort of thing is scifi artist chris foss whose paperback covers communicate the sheer size of his ships and planetbestriding robots better than any other artist chris foss actually worked on chilean lunatic alejandro jodorowskys aborted but hugely influential attempt to film dune back in the 70s and while little of his influence is readily discernible in villeneuves film and thats a pity as well talk about in a bit denis big brutalist spaceships and buildings certainly pack a punch especially on the big screen and you should if you can make the trip for this one oppressively immense walls of metal tower over us and even the quiet airy spaces of the atreides castles on caladan and arrakis seem too large for human use the spacing guild heighliners that carry house ships and personnel between the stars are so big you begin to understand how an ant must feel when a human fingertip stabs towards it with murderous intent and we havent even got to the worms yet the plot of dune is both wellturned earth and a bit byzantine but to summarize it is the year 10191 and humanity has a universespanning civilization organized under powerful noble houses with an emperor at the top of the heap computers are banned but human potential has reached its zenith with human computers called mentats handling the information processing and all kinds of wild shaolinmonklevel martial arts and psychic powers thrown into the mix for good measure the latter chiefly wielded by the bene gesserit an order of allfemale witches who have been manipulating bloodlines for countless generations in order to produce the kwisatz haderach  a universal superbeing capable of bringing order to the cosmos and whom they want to control all space travel is controlled by the navigators of the spacing guild whose own mental abilities allow them to fold space and chart a course between stars they derive this power from ingesting vast quantities of the spice melange a potent narcotic and lifeextending anagathic without the spice all space travel would cease to exist melange is only found on one world the desert planet arrakis also called dune this is a pretty valuable piece of space real estate essentially analogous to the oil fields of the middle east which is also why its home to tribes of fierce desert warriors called fremen who are essentially space bedouin and have been fighting off every noble house tasked with mining spice for ages now when the film opens we got there eventually the emperor has ordered the brutal house harkonnen to cede control of arrakis to their ancient enemies house atreides led by the honorable duke leto oscar isaac house atreides decamps for arrakis with leto his concubine the bene gesserit jessica rebecca ferguson his heir paul timothée chalamet and their trusted servants and advisors including swordsman duncan idaho jason momoa general gurney halleck josh brolin master of assassins thufir hawat stephen mckinley henderson and royal physician doctor wellington yueh chang chen all making the trip they know theyre walking into danger but do not suspect that the emperor has set them up for a fall and house harkonnen led by the loathsome baron vladimir stellan skarsgård and his nephew the brutal glossu rabban dave bautista are planning a terrible betrayal but paul who is reticent about his destiny as the leader of house atreides has been dreaming of arrakis and a fremen girl chani zendaya are his dreams actually prophecy is he the kwisatz haderach and does the future of house atreides lie in the deep deserts of dune with its warrior cults and giant sandworms that took a lot of typing and heres the thing thats half the book the film released this year is dune part one with villeneuve leaving a big old sequel hook dangling just before the end credits however the film as directed by villeneuve and written by him jon spaihts and eric roth does an excellent job of relaying all that info above in clean and elegant ways and more besides some changes to the source material have been made but largely for the better whereas the writings of the princess irulan miss not appearing in this film frame the narrative in the novel and that character as played by virginia madsen delivered the opening voiceover info dump in david lynchs 1984 film adaptation here the duty falls to zendayas chani who muses who will our new oppressors be before we even meet nominal hero paul and his ostensibly honorable family while the film goes to great lengths to illustrate letos steadfastness and the nobility of the atreides to the fremen theyre just another cadre of invaders whove come to plunder the planet thats smart and dune the film is full of similar smart choices the workings of the personal forcefields everyone uses are portrayed in a single perfectly illustrative shot when gurney is training paul similarly a shot of an ornithopters wings beginning to beat as it takes off framed through the still wings of another ornithopter on the landing pad communicates more about the aircraft of arrakis than a whole speech could we still get a speech describing the function of the stillsuits that are vital for survival in the open desert though but given its delivered by sharon duncanbrewster as dr liet kynes and imperial ecologist who has to use a vulgar term gone native thats just fine duncanbrewster is stepping into the slipfashion desert boots of max von sydow the character having been genderflipped since the 84 film and novel and to be honest might actually be an improvement on the swedish legends turn narratively two things stand out for me one is the films clear and vital trust in its audience dune is a big weird story full of bizarre customs and conceits oddball characters alien in the broadest sense of the word technology and more and yet while villeneuves film is deliberately paced to evoke a sense of grandeur and gravitas it rarely if at all stops the action to sit us down and explain things rather it communicates with us visually giving us the data we need to extrapolate a decent understanding of what were seeing the occasional exposition extravaganzas are taken from the source novel and thats hard to complain about for all that dune has been sitting in the unfilmable basket for ages this adaptation is a clear a distillation of frank herberts novel as you could hope for without getting bogged down in reams of talking head as you know bill dialogue looking right at you early 2000s syfy channel miniseries the other thing that impresses is villeneuves gift for locating the emotion in any given scene a vital task in a film of this scale it would be so easy to lose track of that small human element in all the big sweeping epic action but dune is all about the interplay and contrast between the human and the infinite sometimes its a glance between leto and jessica a shot of paul looking at his father a joke cracked by gurney or duncan often its simply letting fergusons jessica drop her mask for a second and see how terrified she is for her son as when the bene gesserit reverend mother charlotte rampling tests him in the films opening scenes the cast is great simply wonderful across the board im not sure if i can see chalamet as the warrior prophet paul later becomes but hes perfect as the unformed young man being put through the gauntlet momoas cocky charisma brings duncan a character previously poorly served on the screen to remarkable life and the same goes for brolins gruff charm as gurney while isaac brings a doomed nobility leto other performers sketch out their characters with limited screentime bautista a genuinely gifted actor is stripped of all but his physicality in the role of rabban although skarsgård is memorably grotesque as the horrifically corpulent baron harkonnen still i think we really missed out on seeing more of david dastmalchian as harkonnen mentat piter de vries  obviously the process of adaptation is one of deciding what to cut though i think his character suffers the most in this version i do love the feral intensity that javier bardem brings to fremen leader stilgar especially in his brief scene with leto but i also think the film missed a trick by not casting mena middle eastern and north african actors as the fremen i also dont think the choice villeneuve did make sinks the ship but its a missed opportunity and if mena actors and activists are angered its not hard to see why while this dune is less guilty of orientalism and endorsing colonialism than its forebears its not guiltfree and while its a complex text and you can argue that the overall series ultimately works as a condemnation of colonialism and white savior tropes its a bit weak for fans to complain when people are engaging with and critical of the text as presented in this form for the record a few years ago when i was ruminating on how youd do dune i landed on three tenepisode tv seasons with mena fremen led by alexander siddigs stilgar and a hispanic house atreides largely due to the bullfighting theme under antonio banderas duke leto a part of me does at any rate when youve got the fingerprints of certified freaks like alejandro jodorowsky and david lynch on the clay its hard not to wish that villeneuve had let his own personal freak flag fly a bit higher this dune is the most accessible version of the source material and thats great but i wonder if it plays it too safe the film makes mention of melange being a sacred hallucinogen but we dont get any hallucinations apart from pauls very literal prophetic dreams recall the nightmarish visions in lynchs version which are not a million miles away in tone from the nightmares that plagued my childhood greig frasers cinematography is gorgeous as is the production design by patrice vermette and the costumes by bob morgan and jacqueline west but the color palette is so subdued as to be mostly beige  even the lush planet caladan is in muted greys and dark greens while the visual realization of the dune universe is impressive im reminded of the mexico filter american filmmakers use to evoke suburban notions of life south of the border for sure it makes those bluewithinblue fremen eyes really pop but the lack of color and art and culture feels off and maybe a little paternalistic indeed were talking about fictional cultures fictional people but theyre meant to remind us of or at least key off of realworld cultures and people and if history has taught us anything its that youve really got to be hard up against it to stop making art its a niggle not a dealbreaker but its one i keep circling and poking at when commentators complain that much of dune looks like a perfume ad i wonder if thats partly down to the brightness being turned down on the cultures against which the action is set perhaps im being precious complaining about such things in what is to my mind a clear fivestar film but i think its a fair criticism and besides when so much is executed so well any flaws are going to stand out all the more rest assured dune is a triumph of a film certainly the best major science fiction film weve had in years and the only real competition comes from movies also directed by denis villeneuve its bold ambitious and staggering in scope but that very ambition pushes it in a certain direction while leaving others less explored perhaps when part two rolls around and we can watch the whole thing as one sweeping epic even my minor gripes will prove unfounded for now we have this and its great
Dec 6 2021,negative, dune is a triumph of mediocrity what it does it does well enough but was it worth doing its a cookiecutter movie a restatement of every trope that now impoverishes cinema size rather than drama action rather than character adrenaline rather than engagement imitation rather than creation a book that sold 20 million copies because of ideas and vision becomes a movie with neither frank herberts novels have been notoriously tricky to adapt as david lynch found in his earlier much recut film version the gifted quebecois director denis villeneuve after fine work on arrival and sicario solves most of the problems by pretending they dont exist he has cut the book into pieces to extend the life of the series hes already making part two the first film retains some of the complexity of herberts plot but doesnt bother with complexity of character  and without that the characters just seem ridiculous a set of medieval knights barons and witches flailing around a desert planet in outer space striking poses against big backdrops  an arthurian legend with more sand than lawrence of arabia the ethereallooking timothee chalamet is paul heir to the throne of the atreides clan on planet caladan oscar isaac is his father the duke who rashly accepts his emperors command to take over mining operations on the planet arrakis rebecca ferguson is pauls mother lady jessica part of a secret order of crazy nuns led by charlotte rampling as reverend mother mohiam who wields pain as a political weapon stellan skarsgard is hilarious as the sleazy baron harkonnen  the flabbiest badass since jabba the hutt  and jason momoa suits up with space armour to play pauls faithful warrior friend the great and good are here in numbers  josh brolin and javier bardem too  but with buggerall to do the hauntingly beautiful american actorsinger zendaya plays the girl of pauls dreams  a warrior nymph from the blueeyed sand warrior tribe the fremen basically its the story of a messiah born to rule in a world full of warring dukes and scheming ladies  something like france in the 12th century every once in a while a giant worm pops up out of the sand and eats a space ship or a spiceharvesting contraption the size of a football field spice is a mineral so rare that empires rest upon its exploitation intergalactic navigation depends upon it when the worm approaches the cinema in which i saw it one of the most technologically equipped in the country started to vibrate even the seats shook with excitement  or dolby wizardry in an era of loud movies this is perhaps the loudest i have experienced in four decades of reviewing the strategy seems to be to beat us into submission you will get excited by physical intimidation if not by stimulation of your imagination dune is probably the first movie in history designed to appeal primarily through the posterior its triumphantly arseabout if youll excuse the expression herbert wrote dune while experimenting with psychotropic fungi he was trying to bring ecology into the realm of mythology while stoned on magic mushrooms villeneuve wants so desperately to break into the modern audiences consciousness to drag us away from our phones that he resorts to an everpresent bass rumble thats like a drone massage come on feel the noise even then in the bestequipped cinema in sydney much of the dialogue was inaudible greig fraser has done a fabulous job as cinematographer but what can you do with a movie that looks so good and sounds so awful the book dune inspired star wars the creation of complete worlds with their own languages and customs was part of what excited george lucas but he added humour denis villeneuve does this adaptation straightfaced just another boring superhero instalment for the generations raised on luke and leia you search in vain for the deeper ideas the sense of a metaphor worth the name a shard of meaning beyond the usual a hero is born guff good luck with that the worm can have the whole thing
Dec 6 2021,positive,villenueve has mistaken humourlessness for seriousness before now but with a dream cast and a streamlined script this dune flies
Dec 5 2021,positive, early in denis villeneuves film dune paul atreides timothée chalamet the teenage scion of a politically powerful family is breakfasting with his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson on their lush rainy homeworld caladan she tells paul that his father duke leto oscar isaac wants him dressed in full uniform today later paul stands on a podium alongside his parents and their key aides weapons master gurney halleck josh brolin and thufir harwat stephen mckinley henderson the mentat of house atreides paul wears a crisply tailored black uniform with collar insignias and a gold braided aiguilette his trousers tucked into kneehigh boots banners flying military forces ranked behind them they watch an imperial delegate spaceship slowly descend its passengers disembark and process towards the podium with great pageantry the herald of the change benjamin clementine reads an official announcement from a scroll the emperor has granted house atreides fiefdom over the desert world arrakis where the precious psychoactive spice melange is sifted from the dunes and used to power interstellar travel duke leto ritually accepts the appointment  we are house atreides there is no call we do not answer  and seals the deal with his ancestral signet ring atreides atreides atreides shout the assembled troops house atreides cares about its traditions  its noble necropolis its love of bullfighting the proud burden of leadership passed from father to son yet underlying their display of power and fealty is a sense of anxious foreboding later lady jessica wakes paul in the middle of the night and makes him dress again for another private ceremony a shadow twin of the first jessica an acolyte of esoteric matriarchal order the bene gesserit has trained paul in her ways and now her mentor reverend mother gaius helen mohiam charlotte rampling arrives in a different spaceship in a different procession to perform a ritual of testing upon paul the way villeneuve repeats ceremonial motifs throughout the film is itself ceremonious the descending aircraft the ranked and waiting staff and troops the formations and processions in formal dress the fraught moments in which risk and safety teeter in balance the simultaneous possibility and doubt that theres something special about paul the chivalric gesture of holding a blade vertically against the heart then horizontally across the head performed first by atreides swordmaster duncan idaho jason momoa and then at the films climax by paul as he begins a ritual duel this isnt a didactic film instead of explaining its feudal courtly world it immerses the viewer in that worlds formalist visual language and the way it loops through fragments of pauls dreams and premonitions  which are relaxed chaotic unceremonial  builds a sense of anticipation or dread in one of his most terrible visions he sees himself alongside chani zendaya the fremen girl from arrakis who has haunted pauls dreams now theyre the ones slowly descending in a spaceship and they turn a pitiless spiceblue gaze downwards as fighters swarm caladan will duke letos ceremony of peaceful power transfer become pauls ceremony of lethal crusade humans are drawn to ceremony because it folds together contrasting ideas of time and space to create heightened meaningful experiences ceremony takes place in an intense present moment yet its events and gestures are traditional and unchanged connecting participants to the longago past by the continuity of the repetition ceremony is also intensely spatial it meshes the subjectivity of human experience with the objectivity of place it can be sublime in the romantic sense in that ceremonies often take place somewhere special that transports us from the everyday provoking overwhelming wonder and an awareness of our smallness in the grand scheme of things cinematographer greig fraser does amazing work here with bold contrasts of light in a film that would have been tempting to flood with warm gold at magic hour  indeed pauls visions of chani are a baitandswitch a teenage dream a perfume commercial inside the atreides stronghold in the arrakis capital arrakeen and in a later sequence in an environmental research station light wells penetrate deep velvety shadows when a poison dart sent by the displaced former spice barons  the pallid insectile house harkonnen  seeks paul in his bedroom he hides in stillness and light like a desert mouse sheltering in a projection of vegetation thrown out by an educational film hes been watching villeneuve returns to this motif of the mouse muaddib which as fans of the novel will know becomes pauls nom de guerre ceremonies can also be mysteries in the sense of the secret religious rites of ancient greece understood only by initiates dune marshals the mood of such hidden power represented here by the bene gesserit i really enjoyed the films use of sound design to render the voice which commands its listener the bene gesserit have basically weaponised ceremony they have spent thousands of years secretly trying to breed the kwisatz haderach a superman who can fold time and space practically as ceremony does magically the eugenic and colonial politics of dune are troubled and this film has caught criticism for choosing soft broad representationism over either the source novels cultural specificity or a more radical revision but its through villeneuves emphasis on ceremony that we can sense the allure of cultural imperialism its a practice that invites participation while the romantic sublime was essentially solitary lonely as a cloud participating in ceremony can also be powerfully communal a surrender of the separate self to a larger shared experience cinemagoing is also a ceremony a shared surrender to darkness and dazzlement and what are film tropes and genres but rituals which draw their power from the way they call to their own past as they unfurl along paths made smooth from repetition and anticipation we dont often express our spectatorship that way though well talk about how some films feel more cinematic because they marshal spectacle on a grand scale or because their deliberate framing blocking and editing make small details and moments feel special and significant sometimes well say a moment in a film is cool or awesome plenty about villeneuves dune is big and spectacular but its small motifs and gestures were what stayed with me i dont think its accidental that hands are so prominent here paul must place his hand in a box of pain he touches the shifting arrakis sands as spice sparkles in the air he and his mother share a handsigned language hands offer and wield crysknives ive never understood the hype about timothée chalamet but i really enjoyed his performance in this film perhaps something about his acting feels at home in formalism yet grates smarmily on me in a naturalistic miseenscène or maybe i too have been lured by the

Dec 4 2021,positive,      to wade into the dune mythology not knowing a whole lot about frank herberts 1965 novel  and with no agenda barring incendies director denis villeneuves badass track record     and the minor mythology of t chalamets runwayready hair  is to bear witness to a fractured and bewildering future world the machinations are a mind boggle but one thing is certain every     bigticket shot rolled out with determined intensity in this first instalment of villeneuves planned twopart tale means mega business       the commodity up for grabs is an invaluable superenhancing spice that among other enviable things makes interstellar travel a reality its home planet of arrakis is a desert hellhole but     thats not about to stop the covetous duke leto of house atreides isaac ruler of the planet caladan or his paramour lady jessica ferguson and their son and heir paul chalamet the     plan orchestrated by their doublecrossing emperor is ostensibly for the duke and his tremendously armoured troops to unseat the ruling house harkonnen and grab arrakis and its spice haul for     themselves unfortunately for the duke the emperor doesnt plan to stop there as any corporate raider could have told him 
Dec 4 2021,positive, in a galaxy ruled by an evil emperor a young man is told he is the inheritor of a legacy that could change the course of history on a harsh desert planet a war between good and evil begins while powerful forces  some of which have access to powers akin to magic  begin to meddle and manipulate fanciful names and titles abound while our hero has a name common on earth today hang on theres no robots  this isnt star wars after all frank herberts 1965 novel dune was such a huge influence on star wars mix dune with flash gordon throw in some decent special effects and youve pretty much got the winning formula its no surprise its had two big budget adaptations over the last forty years david lynchs 1984 attempt remains his one major misfire a confusing and at times embarrassing mess can denis villeneuve arrival sicario finally bring it successfully to the big screen short answer yes in fact go for the biggest screen you can where lynchs version focused on the strange and perverse nature of the galaxy circa 10191 and that date is counted from a point already thousands of years in our future villeneuve goes for sheer size and impact this is a future where humanity is dwarfed by both its creations and the worlds it dwells on if youre after a drinking game you could do worse than take a shot every time we see a giant spaceship touch down close up of landing gear optional followed by a massive access gantry being lowered and a handful of tiny people walking down its definitely impressive to experience even if its slightly at odds with the source material the future of dune which lynch conveyed but villeneuve skips over is one where a religious war long ago wiped out thinking machines there are no robots or computers everything has to be done by someone so combat is mostly handtohand with shields and knives the future of humanity itself will be steered by an individual bred across generations for the role enter paul atreides timothée chalamet son of duke leto oscar isaac and lady jessica rebecca ferguson while he chafes lightly against the confines of being a royal son his father is overseeing a shift in galactic politics the emperor has given house atreides rulership of the desert planet arrakis aka dune its the only known source of spice a hallucinogenic drug that amongst other things makes it possible for humans to guide interstellar travel the previous rulers of dune house harkonnen arent happy which is the point the emperor wants them to fight and harkonnen to win to prevent either side from becoming powerful enough to challenge him the fremen natives of dune have other plans this backdrop of galaxywide intrigue and scheming is a major part of the appeal of the source material  its a big story about big issues  and villeneuve gets that across in every scene theres room for human touches too mostly pauls warmth towards his family and teachers who are alltooaware that in this universe human feeling gets you killed but this is an epic in every sense of the term and if its occasionally a little onenote in the thudding portentousness of it all thats a price villeneuve is clearly willing to pay under the weight of the sheer epic sweep of this film the story itself falters on occasion lynchs version possibly told it better or at least was more interested in it while the plot itself is never muddled many of the supporting characters here blend into the background more than they should on the other hand the insectwinged ornithopters used for travel on dune look amazing if narratively this isnt as fully realised as it could be visually there isnt a dull frame to be found this film focuses on the first half of the novel a sequel telling the second half of the story and possibly providing more of the backdrop was greenlit a week or so into its release overseas theres perhaps a little too much emphasis on pauls mystical visions of the future here pointing the way towards an ending that well now get to see for ourselves in supposedly october 2023 it will be a long wait but considering the epic scale of everything else about dune that seems only fair anthony morris is a freelance film and television writer hes been a regular contributor to the big issue empire magazine junkee broadsheet the wheeler centre and forte magazine where hes currently the film editor other publications hes contributed to include vice the vine kill your darlings where he was their online film columnist the lifted brow urban walkabout and spook magazine hes the coauthor of hit romantic comedy novel the hot guy and hes also written some short stories hed rather you didnt mention you can follow him on twitter morrbeat and read some of his reviews on the blog its better in the dark
Dec 3 2021,positive, if history is anything to go by its been easier to fold space and time than to film frank herberts 1965 scifi classic dune an epic farfuture tale of feuding space dynasties secret sisterhoods and new age prophets that cleaves to  and critiques  the genres classic hero narrative many have tried and perished in the sandstorm wildeyed chilean surrealist alejandro jodorowsky had grand designs  a 14hour version he hoped would star salvador dali mick jagger and orson welles  that proved way too ambitious to realise ridley scott toyed with the idea before giving up and moving on david lynch  a filmmaker in sync with herberts psychic visions  made it all the way to the screen with a memorably grotesque piece of pop art in 1984 only to have it chopped down to the point of near incoherency the latest filmmaker to put their hand in the pain box canadian writerdirector denis villeneuve seems like a bit of an odd choice by comparison hes the kind of filmmaker dubiously marketed as a visionary by studios even as his recent scifi forays  arrival 2016 the deeply unnecessary blade runner 2049 2017  seem better suited to show off flatscreen tvs in designer apartments than evoke any kind of sweeping mystical future so its a pleasant surprise to report that his take on dune which finally descends upon cinemas this week is an engrossing wellmounted adaptation that makes good on his potential as a scifi craftsman  not exactly enough to qualify as a visionary work but an ambitious and largely satisfying space opera that rises like an oasis against the desert of hollywoods current superhero cinema boosted by hans zimmers speakerrumbling score  with its metronomic thump and guttural alien chants  the film is burnished and commanding full of immense wide shots that dwarf the screen jagged spacecraft that seem to emerge from misty oil paintings and an admirable commitment to big earnest movie mythmaking but dunes prettiest effect might be its cast especially its young leads babyfaced androgyne timothée chalamet and galaxyeyed princess zendaya  two kids whore enough to suggest a brighter or at least hotter cosmic future chalamet is paul teenage heir to the noble house atreides a mallgoth glowerpuss who divides his time between learning mind tricks from his witchy mother lady jessica a soulful rebecca ferguson and putting off the politics of the family business with dad house boss and resident dreamboat duke leto atreides oscar isaac its the very distant future  never mind the swords fauxmedieval trimmings and bagpipes  and the galactic emperor has dispatched house atreides to take custody of arrakis the desert planet rich in the spice that is essential to space travel the appointment isnt going down well with the atreidess bitter rivals house harkonnen a planet of sinister creeps who bathe in black slime keep giant spiders as pets and whose leader baron vladimir stellan skarsgård seems modelled after marlon brandos performance in apocalypse now 1979 exploited for its natural resource arrakis  also known as dune  is inhabited by the indigenous fremen a band of blueeyed nomads who include zendayas chani the desert warrior whos been turning up in pauls dreams these premonitions also suggest that paul might be a kind of space messiah much to the concern of lady jessicas clan the bene gesserit a shadowy distaff order of psychic witches whove been trying to summon forth a chosen one  via an atreides daughter  to bridge space and time past and future so much potential wasted on a male hisses the orders reverend mother played by charlotte rampling in a neat echo of her allfemalecult queen in john boormans zardoz 1974 its certainly a lot to swallow for the uninitiated a fact that undid lynchs truncated version in which poor virginia madsen as imperial princess irulan heir to the galaxy had to dispense reels of exposition over the eerie spectral opening moments villeneuve has the relative luxury of two chapters  be warned this is only part one  and he uses this to his advantage allowing the narrative to breathe against the scope of the images shooting partially on location in jordan abu dhabi and norway villeneuve australian cinematographer greig fraser rogue one and production designer patrice vermette sicario arrival give the story a sense of scale and livedin detail welding the widescreen vastness of lawrence of arabia 1962 to the scrappy grit of the first star wars 1977 a film whose desert sequences were famously inspired by herberts writing the vistas are enhanced by all the special effects a reported 165 million dollar budget can buy combat holoshields that glitch and glimmer insectlike ornithopters that swoop through sandstorms and titanic spacecraft that seem to have teleported right off the pulp paperback covers of the 60s and 70s but the showy effects are also offset by an attention to less expected humansized details jason momoas easy moviestar charm as duncan idaho a swordmaster who paul adores the way the great stephen mckinley henderson as human computer thufir hawat parades a parasol during a military inspection or the beverages distilled from sweat tears and spit  presumably not available in the dune combo at the candy bar unless you incur the wrath of a disgruntled teenage employee what villeneuve and his coscreenwriters jon spaihts prometheus and eric roth a star is born will do with dunes overarching narrative  with its messianic leader and looming holy war  is harder to assess given the obviously unfinished nature of their story at least initially paul is a character in conflict with his destiny  as an heir to a patriarchy that ravages an ecosystem as a potential saviour to a people  and chalamet plays him with a suitably furrowed brow villeneuve has also tweaked herberts novel to open the film not on the imperial princesss tale of paul but on chani  effectively framing events through the eyes of the fremen elements drawn from arabic culture and eastern mysticism run throughout herberts work which tangles with themes of colonialism ecological neglect and the corruption of power though this mixing of cultures  a staple device of science fiction  sits less well with the current moment where such creative license however nuanced is viewed with suspicion the new dune has drawn some intelligent criticism for flattening the nuances of herberts text downplaying the source materials grounding in middle eastern culture even as hans zimmers recourse to arabic vocal tones  often used to underscore an emotional moment of pause for the protagonists  leans on a western audiences notion of the mysterious for dramatic shorthand all of which might have been less noticeable had villeneuve been more attuned to the psychic power of images in the way lynch and certainly jodorowsky understood  the kind of filmmaking that might transcend a realworld analogue and transport an audience to something genuinely strange or alien his dune is too polished and cautious to risk putting a foot wrong  which makes sense given this projects history but also means theres nothing here willing to court ridicule and by extension genius if we cant have pugs and space slugs couldnt we at least have gotten timothée chalamet doing the worm in place of the sand walk but it more than captures the attention and sometimes even inspires awe

Dec 3 2021,positive, denis villeneuves dune part 1 aka dune instantly joins the ranks of the great bigbudget massmarket scifi extravaganzas including 2001 star wars close encounters of the third kind and blade runner all of which it either references pays homage to or is clearly influenced by in the case of star wars the references become quite heady because star wars is so clearly influenced by dune the novel that villeneuves imagery rebuilds upon imagery influenced by his source material is this a sandcrawler that i see before me what villeneuve does so well here is make all this familiar stuff feel so fresh and a huge part of it involves hans zimmers score which is ominous threatening suitably alien and omnipresent it really sets the tone and its really unique im no musician but i reckon its singular arresting sonic motif combines or is inspired by the bagpipe and an islamic prayer call this aint also sprach zarathustra nor  very definitely  is it john williams no this is darker all around zimmers intense at times frightening score is clear about that its dark and its serious there is one clear joke delivered by the one character who seems allowed to make jokes everywhere else all is somber in a way it feels like star wars for grownups what took me by surprise was how much action there was the first act is worldbuilding but acts two and three are both pretty much relentless action setpieces it may be hard scifi but its totally accessible its also really fun gorgeous to look at vibrant stimulating and huge its extremely gratifying to see this kind of massive entertainment being made with such inventiveness and intelligence the adaptation of a notoriously challenging text is superb and deserves an oscar nomination for adapted screenplay its villeneuves best film and i greatly look forward to part two cj johnson is the president of the film critics circle of australia fcca a golden globes voter a member of the international body of film critics fipresci and a lecturer in cinema at the art gallery of new south wales sydney film school and other institutions

Dec 2 2021,positive, dune denis villeneuves adaptation of the science fiction novel by frank herbert begins with an ambush armed figures patrol a desert devoid of human life guarding machines that mine swirls of sand for a rare and mysterious commodity called spice then attackers emerge from the sand beneath their feet and the desert erupts in gunfire and explosions the ambush is part of a campaign that is not successful in voiceover an enigmatic character named chani played by the actor zendaya reveals that our warriors couldnt free the planet from the harkonnens the occupying force responsible for the mining operation but the scene establishes a motif that recurs throughout the film a landscape that appears static and unchangeable shifts under ones feet      dune is by almost any set of criteria a difficult novel to adapt into film alejandro jodorowskys failed attempt and david lynchs campy and largely unsuccessful 1984 adaptation provide evidence of the pitfalls the story takes place within looming spaceships and across ecologically distinct planets including its main setting the desert world of arrakis which is inhabited by enormous sandworms that regularly gobble up mining rigs and aircraft these worms produce the spicea cross between a fossil fuel and a powerful hallucinogenneeded for everything from space travel to religious rituals given the importance of alien fauna and futuristic technology to the story its hard to avoid the slapstick of failed special effectsfor example in a climactic scene in lynchs adaptation you can see bits of green screen

of detail that feels compelling without being opaque or as in lynchs adaptation cheesy and overthetop the narrative has been adjusted to place it closer to contemporary postcolonial theory they ravage our lands in front of our eyes why did the emperor choose this path and who will our next oppressors be chani asks in the films opening scene clarifying its political allegiances the films greatest success is its understanding of scale clusters of humans in vast landscapes of their own making isolated from the past and future these landscapes and the structures humans build on top of them appear

Dec 1 2021,positive, despite reading frank herberts 1965 novel many moons ago and viewing david lynchs bizarre 1984 adaptation during my youth dune was still a title that felt foreign to me when entering the theatre to bare witness to denis villeneuves muchdiscussed imagining  sure i can clearly see the inspiration this operatic story had on the sciencefiction tales that came in the years since  namely a little series known as star wars  and the narrative surrounding the spice business at the core of the story lacks subtlety when held up to the petroleum industry of the now but villeneuves vision in all its robust glory is its own beast and in adapting the novel with his own unique vision hes made familiar material feel somewhat untapped dune or dune part one as its so specifically stated during the opening credits is a film so vast that we are thankful we have a confirmed sequel to look forward to as perhaps to the frustration of many a viewer this is a product that very much feels narratively unfinished  its heavy on exposition that in some ways it feels designed as a precursor for a bigger grander story to be told one that villeneuve and cowriters eric roth forrest gump a star is born and jon spaihts prometheus doctor strange consistently tease throughout with certain influential characters deliberately shadowed anyone hoping zendaya will have a constant presence best check their expectations as the starlets screentime barely adds up to 5 minutes in total speaking of zendaya her character chani is what seemingly drives the story forward for its protagonist young paul atreides timothée chalamet the ducal heir of the house atreides a royal family of sorts who have taken over ruling duties of arrakis a harsh desert planet known for its produce of spice a valuable substance that bestows its users heightened vitality and expanded consciousness  under the ruling of his father the stern duke leto atreides oscar isaac and his various aides  namely weapons master gurney josh brolin and swordmaster duncan idaho jason momoa one of the few actors on hand able to inject a genuine sense of fun into proceedings  paul is instructed in the ways of combat and self defence  at odds with this are the teachings from his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson simply luminous a member of a divine sisterhood whose representatives possess advanced physical and mental abilities attributes she is sharing with paul in spite of the fact that these only be shared with other women holding the power he has honed from his mothers teachings  specifically something called the voice a vocal tone that manipulates the minds and wills of others  signifies a future of greatness for paul and the visions that haunt him throughout though unclear to him as to what they represent connects him to the mysterious chani and a tribe of warriors that will seal his fate whether that be aligned with his salvation or doom is yet to be determined  his fathers move to arrakis indicates pauls vision holds weight and the majority of dunes significant run time  it clocks in around 156 minutes  bases itself around positional politics and a heft of double and triple crossing that if youre not paying attention finding a narrative entry point may be a somewhat murky experience thankfully so much of dune works purely on an aesthetic level  though its a particularly muted looking film in terms of colour it remains no less gorgeous in its visual sumptuousness as to what villeneuve and cinematographer greig fraser rogue one the batman create and display on screen and the performances though understandably heightened never indulge in unnecessary melodramatics  its a larger than life film and though it easily could have rested on spectacle it manages to have substance in its detailing of tyranny rebellion and respecting ones culture  a true achievement in every sense of the word film critic with a penchant for dwayne johnson jason momoa michelle pfeiffer and horror movies harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news
Dec 1 2021,positive, dune  155 minutes m yes its been worth the wait having been delayed for over a year thanks to covid dune lands with grace beauty and on a scale so awesome and majestic and immersive it often looks like they flew out and shot the thing on alien worlds as jawdropping as the sweep of the film often is writerdirector denis villeneuve incendies prisoners blade runner 2049 has done a superb job using the epic scope and grand designs that power the films rich visuals to frame an engrossing intimate characterstrong story of dynastic ascendancy colonization and interplanetary rivalry the desert planet arrakis contains a special spice in its sands for the indigenous people the fremen it has great health benefits for those who come to plunder it the spice gives them the power to traverse space for mysterious reasons the notsonice and rather ugly miners from house harkonnen have upped stumps and left arrakis in their gargantuan bricklike ships and gone back to their dark grotty home planet giedi prime replacing them to harvest the spice are their enemies from house atreides a far more attractive bunch of people who reside on the far more attractive postcardfriendly planet of caladan awarded the planet by the intergalactic emperor  there always has to be an intergalactic emperor just like in star wars  the duke oscar isaac has a different agenda than his predecessors yes they need the spice but he wants kinder gentler dealings with the local fremen whose powers and knowledge he wants to harness to secure dominion over the planet against the everpresent threat of the harkonnen hordes by his side is son paul timothee chalamet a gaunt eager young lad who would rather be at the rough end of operations with space jock and trusted pal duncan idaho jason momoa duty however demands he keep within his ceremonial and diplomatic roles after all he is in line to take over house atreides paul is also trying to master an inherited gift called the voice a mind control power notatall dissimilar to the force from star wars a coincidence surely ahem on top of that paul radiates a strong vibe that has those around him suspecting that he could be the one again a concept notatall dissimilar to what we saw in star wars  so off they scoot to arrakis the hot desert planet again an idea notatall dissimilar to luke skywalkers home planet tatooine anyone else sensing that its possible george lucas might have read dune before coming up with star wars just a thought we didnt needed yet more proof that australian cinematographers are world leaders in the art yet here we have greig fraser last ride the boys are back zero dark thirty foxcatcher filling the film with luminous images that often make it look like they went offworld and shot the film in space has somebody already said that with stately compositions that are often painterly he captures both the jawdropping scale of the story and its intimacy as when paul connects with a tiny bigeared kangaroo mouse that inhabits the hot sands of the planet lovers of movie spacecraft will love dune for its design work and the marvellous extremes therein on the one hand when were in space we get an assortment of oddshaped spaceships with smooth features and an imposing presence on the ground however its a fabulously different design deal everyone flies about in things called ornithopters which is like a helicopter but instead of rotor blades there are these long foldable wings that make the machines look like giant mechanical dragonflies theyre beautiful to behold yet they have the visceral nutsandbolts feel of a loud flying machine with everyone having to yell to be heard through clunky headsets its a stark contrast to the ships we see in orbit a brilliant example of great movie design work its the emotion and intrigue that matters most of course along with staging some stellar action sequences  including a great rescue setpiece involving a sandworm  villeneuve does a superlative job imbuing the drama with a fruity shakespearean feel as the actors move about massive sets clearly inspired by the brutalist school of making things look grand and commanding and a bit oppressive the beleaguered fremen have long been forced to fight for their survival in the face of a neverending succession of invaders who come to plunder their home for resources without giving them a  cut in this regard you cant help but warm to the performance by oscar isaacs who gives the duke a real sense of regal decency he knows the power of his vast forces yet his intentions towards the fremen is based on respect and partnership and desperate though he is to get spice production up to speed he gallantly puts life before profit as one scene boldly illustrates its a really deft touch that really grounds the duke as a man of honour for his part timothée chalamet does a fine job in the lead as paul tentatively feels his way into the role he is destined for reluctant though he might be to accept such huge responsibility the film is of course based on frank herberts awardwinning 1965 novel a universally hailed work long regarded as one of the most influential in modern scifi as george lucas would no doubt attest those whose formative years were in the 1970s the novel also holds the distinction of being the most popular unread novel of the decade everybody owned a copy but nobody ever got through the first few chapters because the story was so dense after the incomprehensible garble of david lynchs 1984 film whichever version you sat through and the very good if occasionally plodding 2000 miniseries frank herberts dune starring william hurt it is heartening that this dune has as one of its producers frank herberts son brian who has written many novels in the dune canon if only theyd worked in a cameo for kyle maclachlan or even david lynch to complete the circle perhaps theyll pop up in the sequel which is already in preproduction
Nov 30 2021,positive, when it comes to remakes and reboots hollywood has a natural tendency to stick what works from comic book adaptations like spiderman to dramasturnedmusicals like a star is born to actionfests like king kong to period piece dramas like little women to likeaction transfers like beauty and the beast to slasherthrillers like halloween to iconic westerns like true grit the rationale is obvious  if its made money before theres a good chance itll make money again dune goes against the grain yes its based on the bestselling 1965 sciencefiction novel from author frank herbert but when first adapted for the screen in 1984 it was both a critical and financial failure americas two leading film critics of the time gene siskel and roger ebert described it as the biggest disappointment of the year and needlessly complicated it made just 30 million usd at the local boxoffice below its budget and even director david lynch admitted it was a total failure the most noticeable difference in this new adaptation from frenchcanadian director denis villeneuve prisoners arrival is that its a twoparter with the second instalment slated for release in late 2023 having five hours to work with as opposed to just two provides a far greater opportunity to explore this interesting world and flesh out the many characters within it utilising the latest technology in terms of both visual and sound effects also provides a legup over its cheaperlooking predecessor the plot is hard to surmise succinctly but to do my best dune is a multiway power struggle set in the distant future the year 10191 to be precise the desert planet of arrakis contains the most valuable substance in the universe  a spice used as fuel for interstellar travel three key groups are looking to control it  the alliancebuilding house atredies the villainous house harkonnen and the native population of freman oh i should mention the planet is also home to some giant peopleeating worms whilst the film boasts one of the largest bigname casts of the year this is timothée chalamets show hes front and centre throughout and his impassioned noteperfect performance is the key reason why audiences will invest their emotions he plays the stylish paul atreides heir to his familys throne and a powerful young warrior who is discovering and harnessing newfound skills both physical and mental that will be pivotal in deciding the future of arrakis following on from his oscar nominated performance in call me by your name and scenestealing efforts in little women im convinced the 25yearold chalamet is one of the best actors of his generation villeneuve has been publicly critical of a decision made by warner bros to release his film simultaneously in cinemas and hbo max in the united states that view could be seen as arrogant and nearsighted given everything thats happened with covid but having seen the finished product its easier to see why he wants it seen in packed movie theatres dune is as much an experience as it is a movie  an orgy of immersive visuals music and sound that pull you into its enthralling world i bought my first hans zimmer soundtrack three decades ago backdraft and dune will be the next addition to the collection the 64yearold composer is the master of adrenalinpumping scores interstellar is a masterpiece and this is another beauty australian cinematographer greig fraser lion also deserves a shoutout for the distinctive contrasts he creates interior v exterior shots and the use of tight facial closeups in pivotal scenes it resembles a poetic terrence malick film in places
Nov 29 2021,positive, welcome to my site my name is andrea thompson and im a writer editor and film critic who is a member of the chicago indie critics and also the founder and director of the film girl film festival which you can find more info about at filmgirlfilmcom i have no intention of becoming any less obsessed with cinema comics or nerdom in general credit to director denis villeneuve and his fellow cowriters they are serious about the latest adaptation of dune and in doing justice to frank herberts novel as in deathly serious since i wasnt the only one laughing at the screening when the film kicked off by announcing dreams are messages from the deep ive not seen the other dune adaptations and have really only bothered with any part of the franchise until recently so i cant say how well other attempts at bringing herberts book to the big and small screen holds up so it might just be my ignorance talking when i say that the 2021 version is one of the best most skillful attempts at bringing an intricate infamously dry world to life ive seen  lets face it its hard to picture anyone but the most ardent fans enjoying a discussion about the economics of spice palace intrigue and religious and political philosophy but villeneuve is determined to have his cake and get moviegoers to eat it too because he actually manages to fill us in on the world of young nobleman paul atreides timothée chalamet whose family is sent to manage the affairs on dune a desert planet containing the allimportant spice only to experience death and disaster at the hands of their enemies the harkonnens thats where things get kind of awkward because humanism doesnt exactly inform herberts philosophy the world he created is unapologetically elitist and the atreides family are the good guys mostly because theyre the more reasonable colonizers the movie doesnt try to avoid this at least openly pointing out that paul and his parents the duke leto atreides oscar isaac and lady jessica atreides rebecca ferguson are basically the new oppressors especially to the desert people known as the fremen leto has just enough time to prove how much they want to be nice before things go to hell and paul and his mother jessica are forced to flee into the harsh desert environment of dune in order to survive just how it comes to that is where the movie falters in the book the harkonnens were dangerous calculating enemies who could believably triumph against the honorable atreides family they were going to undergo a few changes regardless since main villain baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård embodied the worst villain tropes taken to an extreme  fat decadent and a predatory gay man with a nauseating predilection for teenage boys its noteworthy then that the only characteristic that survives from the original is the fat part with the baron an almost featureless floating blob and the rest of the harkonnens equally as lacking in development and with their bald heads and allblack clothing clearly on the side of evil its not much for a genre thats often defined by the opposition but those who choose to view dune in the environment they were clearly meant to will have a lot to enjoy many films have claimed to be strictly for the theatrical experience but dune is one of the few who can honestly make that claim and its sound design is on par with the quiet place dialogue is raised and lowered as were meant to perceive it and the allencompassing world has the effects to go with it leaving my chair literally rattled beneath me during some sequences in other words come to theater and youll live quite deliciously throughout the two and a half hour runtime and if the villains are a bore theres plenty of side characters which include josh brolin and jason momoa as the warriors gurney halleck and duncan idaho respectively to liven things up even the character of paul bows to 2021 standards its hard to picture the book version kicking off his morning with a joke but thankfully chalamet is allowed to bring some badly needed levity every now and then without having to fulfill the usual shirtless wonder requirements with isaac stepping up to give us a little thirst trap lets hope it carries on to the next film because theres no guarantee that therell be one its been a long time since the days of simultaneous filming and lord of the rings and whether therell be a part two hopefully with more zendaya isnt a done deal at least until warner bros sees the box office receipts thats disappointing because this is clearly a set up one which introduces us to a world and tears it down when zendayas chani says this is only the beginning its a meta prophecy in itself and the hope of studios everywhere
Nov 29 2021,positive,villeneuves dune is a triumphantly cohesive assembly of a very difficult to adapt novel by frank herbert
Nov 20 2021,positive,dune is easily one of the best visually  audibly crafted films of 2021 hans zimmers score is perfection narratively hmmm not so much
Nov 20 2021,positive,dune part one is a stunning piece of work in that context one that could well be for the ages
Nov 19 2021,negative, theres more of timothée chalamet in dune in considerably less whimsical mood and more oscar isaac too  just as saturnine as in the card counter but behind a severe fatherly beard this longawaited blockbuster is cinemas third stab at frank herberts supposedly unfilmable science fiction epic outré visionary alejandro jodorowsky tried but it never happened while david lynch did pull it off but to somewhat murky effect now comes denis villeneuve sicario arrival with a dune for the cgi age his version certainly takes the novel seriously and itself too its unfailingly sombre as if determined not be written off as merely star wars sprinkled with sand chalamet plays paul atreides scion of a planetary dynasty given the contract to extract the priceless material spice from the deserts of arid planet arrakis that pallid youth paul may be the foretold messiah who will one day bring about the liberation of arrakiss desertdwelling fremen  could this be any more of a white saviour fantasy still it seems that villeneuve wont get round to grappling with that problematic issue until episode 2 if it ever gets made the most ominous closing words in recent cinema this is just the beginning this film gets as far as landing paul and his mother rebecca ferguson in the desert til then we get a lengthy caravanserai of austere set pieces a beautiful platform for patrice vermettes extraordinary designs and various striking performances stellan skarsgård is the levitating villain baron harkonnen charlotte rampling is her icy best as an intergalactic mother superior josh brolin and jason momoa are burly bruisers with beards
Nov 19 2021,positive, craftwise dune is a marvel filled with impressive visual effects imaginative costumes and an otherworldly score by hans zimmer but the cinematography falls victim to that all too modern trap of being drastically underlit and murky all this is in service of a plot that feels shockingly threadbare for a film thats about intergalactic political intrigue and civil war this is mostly due to this being act i of a larger narrative but if the lord of the rings managed to deliver three films with three act structures and fully rounded stories i see no reason why dune cant do the same theres clearly an interesting world here one that provides an alltootimely critique of wealthy elites vying for control of natural resources in order to gain political power but dune takes three hours to get to really get started and then it ends  perhaps it will ultimately work better when seen in its full context once part ii is released but dune as it stands is a curiously weightless affair all sturm and no drang a vaguely intriguing setup that is shockingly unsatisfying one cant help but feel that the narratives been robbed of its context serving as little more than an appetizer for another better film  its a first act without a climax a sweeping visual spectacle that ultimately lacks the substance to justify its grim selfseriousness heres hoping part ii makes it all worth it
