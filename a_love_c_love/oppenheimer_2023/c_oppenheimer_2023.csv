"Apr 7, 2024",positive," As increasing tensions with Russia rise once again, it seems fitting that Oppenheimer sets forth the events that led to those initial tensions in aftermath of World War II. For too many, the Cold War still haunts their memories of fallout shelters and threats of nuclear annihilation and that fear stems from one event, the creation of the atomic bomb. Brought in by the U.S. government hoping to beat Nazi Germany to the punch of creating one, they choose one of the foremost theoretical physicists in the world, in spite of his wide travels of Europe. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a brilliant scientist, but his curiosity and desire to advance technology lead him on a collision course with history. This film follows Oppenheimer from his time as a young physics student to the head of the Manhattan Project as he works with some of the leading scientists in the world to put together a nuclear weapon to his post-Hiroshima/Nagasaki efforts to foster nuclear disarmament, which earned him a secret investigation that brought down the man who orchestrated it, Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). There’s a lot of ground to cover in this 3-hour biopic, but director Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job of keeping things moving while skillfully explaining to the audience some of the more esoteric concepts on display. Writing your own screenplay like Nolan has gives you an intimate knowledge of the subject matter, but it also keeps you from seeing some of the flaws. While it’s a lot of years to go over, it still feels like it drags a bit through its middle hour. Still, most of his more excessive tendencies, the ones that marred films like Interstellar are kept thankfully in check. The slow realization that Oppenheimer makes about the destructiveness of his efforts might sit poorly with audiences who expect him to come to understand its devastating capabilities sooner. However, as an early scene with him trying to poison his professor shows, it isn’t until after a lot of dwelling that he comes to that conclusion and attempts to rectify it. At that point, perhaps it’s too late, especially against an administration desperate to label him as a malcontent and a foreign spy. The film’s performances are all solid, especially Murphy in the lead role. His shift from wide-eyed optimist to cog in the political machine to anti-nuclear activist is convincing with the toll of years weighing heavily on his face. Nolan has always known how to use Murphy well and he might well have given him the role of his career. That’s not to demean anyone else in the film. Downey Jr., Josh Hartnett, and Florence Pugh all deliver strong performances. Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife has some great scenes, but they build up almost out of nowhere. Her third act emergence as a key emotional force of anger in the film feels disingenuous. It’s an underwritten role for an actor who deserves better. That said, there is an utter sour note in the film and its the cameo of Gary Oldman as President Harry S. Truman. His scenery chewing abomination is tacky.Truman was oft said to have defended the decision to save hundreds of thousands of lives by dropping the bomb, but that decision-making process is given short shrift and the nuance of any such event is marred by the flippant dismissal of Oppenheimer. It’s a crass moment that wasn’t needed at least not without more context, even if rooted in strong anecdotal evidence.  Anyone leaving this film should take to heart Oppenheimer’s quote recited twice in the film. The first is as the optimist sharing conjugal relations with Pugh’s character, reciting from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad-Gita, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” It is an instructive quote for if his character did not fully understand its salience upon its first utterance, his late-film use of the phrase drives the point home effectively. Oppenheimer is a film about cycles and patterns, such as what Oppenheimer himself attempted to bring to theoretical physics and ultimately to applied physics. His theories are scientific brilliance, but the end result is incredibly tragic. It exemplifies not just the difficulty of advancing technology without harming others but also the challenge of coming to terms with what’s created afterwards. It takes a noble mind to recognize one’s culpability in that and this film enables the viewer to recognize that and honor Oppenheimer’s legacy however challenging it might be."

"Mar 8, 2024",positive," There are moments that change everything. The detonation of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima is arguably one of those moments: the birth of a weapon of untold destructive power. For the first time, mankind had the potential to destroy the world in a matter of hours, if not minutes. Oppenheimer (2023) tells the story of the creation the bomb and the man who spearheaded the project. Cillian Murphy plays Robert J. Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who put together the team and masterminded the architecture of the Manhattan Project. Thin and weary looking, with an impassive expression and bright blue eyes that are a well of determination and worry, Murphy incarnates Oppenheimer as a man driven. As a Jewish-American, he feels a duty to stop Hitler and the Third Reich at all costs, and he fears that Nazi scientists are already ahead of the rest of the world in their project to harness atomic energy. But there is also the pioneer spirit of a scientist conquering the next frontier, putting the theoretical into practice in an unprecedented way. Nolan gives us the sweep of his complicated life—the film spans decades and features scores of characters—as it delves into the history, the politics, and the morality around it. He wrote the screenplay (based on the biography by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin) and hews to the historical record, and there is a lot going on: a marriage (Emily Blunt plays his often frustrated wife) and family dragged around and often neglect in his odyssey, friendships tested by his zealousness, the tug-of-war between politics, military expediency, and scientific possibility. And, true to form, Nolan jumps around key periods, helping us keep the eras straight with different styles. It’s challenging, to be sure, but not daunting. For a film so enmeshed in ideas and loaded with meeting and conversations and debates (scientific and moral), it is as visually compelling as it is narratively. Nolan is a filmmaker who has commanded huge budgets and production resources. He made Oppenheimer on a relatively smaller budget, at least compared to previous production, and creates an epic of sorts that never shows signs of compromise. And for that first test detonation in the desert, he displays the power and fury of the atomic explosion without recourse to digital effects. It’s a remarkable way to evoke the power of splitting atoms unleashing the fury of the gods. Matt Damon is General Leslie Groves, who gambles on Oppenheimer and backs him against the government’s wariness of his past politics, and Robert Downey Jr. the chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, a wily political player whose resentment of Oppenheimer drives efforts to discredit the scientist once the war is over. They are the most consequential supporting players in a massive cast and it’s to Nolan’s credit that even the smaller supporting roles carve out their own place in the story: Kenneth Branagh as Dutch physicist Niels Bohr, Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock (who had a long affair with Oppenheimer), Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. There’s also David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Benny Safdie, and Casey Affleck, just to scratch the surface. It won seven Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actor for Cillian Murphy, and supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr., and Nolan won best director awards from the Director’s Guild and the New York Film Critics Circle.

"Mar 8, 2024",positive," Writers’ lives as depicted in French films continue to be things of great mystery, and I don’t mean murder mystery. In Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall, a married, middle-aged writer couple (Sandra Hüller and Samuel Theis) seems overly involved in rap fandom. Their dog is named Snoop and husband Samuel “often,” according to wife Sandra, plays an instrumental steel-drum version of 50 Cent’s “P.I.M.P.” at full volume while doing home repairs on their massive A-frame in the French Alps. The day he falls out a window and dies—accidentally, a suicide, murdered by Sandra, who knows?—he’s blaring it “on a loop.” The film will go on to pester us with this track five times during various flashbacks and trial scenes. It comes across as a weird joke or a prank Triet is playing that has some meaning for her but not for us. It’s not mischievous like the repetition of “California Dreamin’” in Chungking Express because Anatomy of a Fall is otherwise po-faced. By the end, any sympathy we might have had for Samuel evaporates with these “P.I.M.P.” needle drops. They make him into a ridiculous man, and after 152 minutes it’s a great relief not that Sandra has been exonerated of his murder, but that we won’t have to hear those steel drums again. Triet’s previous film, Sibyl (2019), was agile, witty, and original. This one is prosaic, as if an article from The Cut about the domestic lives of writers has been crossed with an episode of Law & Order. If only an expert like Ice-T had shown up in the courtroom scenes to push stop on “P.I.M.P.” and explain things to the judge: “Somebody try to bust my eardrums, I’m gonna bust their ass.” The writer couple (Greta Lee and John Magaro) in Celine Song’s debut feature, Past Lives, are younger, less established, and blander than the one in Anatomy of a Fall. Residents of a not-great apartment in the Lower East Side, they don’t have much in the way of personality. Nora is Korean and a playwright, Arthur a white-guy novelist who has written a novel called Boner. If Nora can be said to have a characteristic, it is her desire to win literary prizes. She has left her successful arty parents behind in South Korea “because Koreans don’t win the Nobel Prize for Literature.” She also dreams of winning a Pulitzer and a Tony. This seemed dated and contrived, since Koreans do win Oscars. Pretending Nora is not a screenwriter-director like her creator, or might become one, is a deflection after Parasite’s success in 2020. The film is more literature than cinema, elevated mumblecore for graduate writing seminars, the opposite of, for instance, Hong Sangsoo, who makes low-budget films about writers and filmmakers without worrying about prizes, and whose films don’t seem written at all. With its expensive-looking cinematography, Slowdive-sounding score, and fancy editing, Past Lives is designed to win awards, which it has. Like Nora, Celine Song made a conscious choice to leave one life behind and start another. Her film is the result of a series of other professional choices, too, and it shows. It is hard to understand the decisions that went into Cord Jefferson’s adaptation of Percival Everett’s unique and startling novel Erasure but, with the exception of the cast, they were decisions that don’t work. American Fiction is watered-down, unexciting, and nonabrasive. Its unclever title is an example of the film’s basic strategy, which is to take material that might offend people, material that was in fact designed to offend people, and update it for a world that demands to not be offended. Though it’s topped with an inconclusive series of postmodern codas, this is a family comedy with Hallmark touches. When the main character, Thelonious “Monk” Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a beleaguered Black novelist, announces early in the movie that he doesn’t believe in race, I didn’t think that meant he wanted to be in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The twin worlds of publishing and Hollywood are mocked here, without ever looking or feeling anything like those worlds do in real life. The ersatz quality of it all extends to the music on the soundtrack. Why hire the great Patrice Rushen to play gentle jazz piano over everything, in a score she didn’t write herself? An earlier meta-scene, in which we see Keith David and Okieriete Onaodowan as a stereotypical drunk father and gangbanger son acting out scenes in Ellison’s deliberately bad novel, and arguing with him about how corny and exploitative they are, is a good idea, but it’s truncated, maybe because it hits too close to what Jefferson is doing himself. The direct criticism of other movies in that scene and in other parts of American Fiction is dubious, too. Are we supposed to think Boyz N the Hood is a bad movie now? It’s a thousand times better than this one. Jeffrey Wright seems held back in American Fiction. The same cannot be said of Paul Giamatti, who plays a lonely, bitter classics teacher at a New England prep school in Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers. Fitted with one wall-eye contact lens, Giamatti stares at the corner of the room while fixing what’s left of his gaze on his students, whom he considers recalcitrant philistines, “entitled little degenerates.” Giamatti’s performance is a pleasure to watch. He is the presiding presence in the movie, and David Hemingson’s erudite screenplay allows him free range to deliver long lines of invective. At the same time Giamatti is part of a Three Stooges act with Da’Vine Joy Randolph, as the taciturn manager of the school’s cafeteria, and Dominic Sessa, the one student left behind at the school over Christmas. If this trio seems to shut out the rest of the world and to reduce the other characters in the film to walk-ons, it’s because they are also doing that in their own lives, each trapped alone in various stages of grief. The Holdovers is destined to be a Christmas classic precisely because it is not a feel-good movie. Randolph’s son is a casualty of an unjust war, Sessa’s father is a hopeless mental case with the official Cuckoo’s Nest haircut of institutionalized madness, and Giamatti is denied a happy ending as he drives away from the school with a bottle of pilfered brandy pressed to his lips. The movie isn’t feel-good. Set in 1970, it is nostalgic. Payne and cinematographer Eigil Bryld have given The Holdovers a warm, old-school shot-on film look that the viewer can slip into like a coma. Leonie Benesch gives a sensitive, lively performance in The Teachers’ Lounge as Carla, a young seventh grade teacher in Hamburg. With her two big, functional eyes and her positive attitude, she’s the opposite of Giamatti in The Holdovers. She shows love for her students and a great desire to help them, which she expresses with dance-like physicality in the gym classes she teaches along with her main job, teaching math, an arrangement that would be comic in an American film but in a German one is graceful and nurturing. She’s too good to be true, so of course director İlker Çatak is setting her up for a fall. A series of thefts at the school implicates minority students in the eyes of the other teachers, but Carla suspects one of her colleagues, thereby initiating a series of events that will embroil this place of learning in recriminations, ill will, and chaos. But it’s a lite, low-stakes kind of chaos. The lesson here is that no good deed goes unpunished. The film is a mild version of a Haneke movie, seemingly made for the middle-schoolers who populate it and who are presumably not yet ready for a full-strength Piano Teacher’s lounge. Barbie like no movie before it pushed the limit of what constitutes legitimate news versus what’s free publicity for a pseudo-event designed to rake in money for a large corporation. Obviously Barbie came out ahead, making $1.5 billion worldwide, though even with that haul, Barbie’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, somehow lost $3.1 billion in 2023. If their board of directors was on the ball, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig would be running the studio, not David Zaslav. The push for Barbie was intense. Its only analogue was the right-wing media’s obsession with Hunter Biden, the MAGA Barbie. CNN.com, which is also owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, published 128 separate news stories about the film. The New York Times published 84 pieces on Barbie, and mentioned Barbie in non-Barbie-related pieces over 450 times. Richard Brody of the New Yorker became Barbie’s Number One fan among film critics, tweeting about Barbie or its principals some three dozen times, including one tweet in French and another that stated that Barbie was a better movie than 2001: A Space Odyssey, “except for the unrivalled Stargate sequence.” Brody had mentioned Barbie as early as February 2020, more than three years before the film came out, in a review of the Robbie-superhero-starrer Birds of Prey, in which he told readers he was “greatly looking forward to her performance in the title role of Barbie, the next film by Greta Gerwig, who, I suspect, will have an altogether more original view of Robbie’s art.” That is what you call advance praise. One CNN.com piece, on how enraging it was to the author that Robbie and Gerwig were not nominated for a Best Actress and Best Director Oscars, stated that the only people who “didn’t love” Barbie were “reactionary right-wing dorks.” When Hillary Clinton weighed in with a punny tweet to console Robbie and Gerwig about the snub, it became clear that Barbie was a form of official art, an item of capitalist realism about which only one set of values should be expressed in public. It was supposed to matter that those values were feminist and not just consumerist. This view and its proponents became clearer for me recently when a cinephile friend told me about how last July she had excused herself from a bachelorette party that included going to see Barbie. She thought she had dodged the pink bullet, but one day in January while she was out she got a couple of texts from her building’s unofficial super, a man in his sixties. “Have you seen Barbie?” the first text asked. “If not, you should. It’s quite clever and funny,” said the second. “I left it on your stair just in case.” When she got home and entered her building, there it was: a Blu-Ray of Barbie borrowed from the local library sitting on the steps to her door. Yorgos Lanthimos is our leading auteur of half-baked ideas, but since he’s begun working with screenwriter Tony McNamara on movies starring Emma Stone, things have started to gel and get moist. Poor Things, a film of “sugar and violence,” is a bizarro Barbie, a forceful, entertaining movie without smugness, featuring a kind of outré production design all its own. Every effect is thrown in: the film is in color and black-and-white, it pushes the use of wide-angle cinematography in new directions, hybrid animals wander about, and mad scientist Willem Dafoe belches floating orb-like bubbles—all this before the film gets to Emma Stone’s Bella, a Victorian wild child chasing mysteries of the organism through an ocean liner’s casino and a Parisian brothel. Dafoe is a disfigured Frankenstein and Stone his messy, demanding monster, a creation that escapes his lab, moves on, and quickly takes over the action. Once she discovers the pleasures of sex (“furious jumping”) with Mark Ruffalo’s louche playboy, she leaves England for Lisbon, a world of fine dining and ballroom dancing where she gets to declare, immortally, “I must go punch that baby.” It was reported that Poor Things looks like a Tim Burton movie. It doesn’t—it’s more like an animated Karel Zeman movie come to life—though it does synthesize almost every Frankenstein movie that came before it. Instead, it’s a film with a true Sadean quality, made for libertines, not Puritans, who will find many opportunities in it to be offended. It’s about time something so wicked was made at such a high level. I’m troubled by writers who never ask themselves, “What if I didn’t do this?” Some things should be passed over in silence. I felt that way last fall when Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour came out in theaters. When I noticed aging male film critics rushing to see this nearly three-hour concert film so they could write about it, I was embarrassed for them. Another kind of movie is also like that to me: musicals based on movies that were not musicals but which became stage musicals, then movies again. I saw the musical version of The Producers when it came out in 2005 and it struck me as inert, laughless, and botched. Since then I have avoided musical versions of Hairspray and Mean Girls, and probably some others I’ve forgotten existed. The new Color Purple movie musical is one of these. It starts well, with a pre-title song called “Huckleberry Pie” performed with delighted charm by Phylicia Pearl Mpasi and Halle Bailey as sisters, accompanied by Colman Domingo as a bluesman cowboy playing banjo on a horse. Set along the Georgia coast amid trees draped in Spanish moss, this number appeared to pay homage to Daughters of the Dust and was directed by Blitz Bazawule in a very up-to-the-minute CGI style that showed a certain flair, like maybe the movie was going to use its artifice to some new advantage other of these musicals had not. As an introductory interlude that evoked life in a rural Black community in 1909, it promised something that was not just hokum. But then the rest of the film was just hokum, and there was a lot of it, with plenty of beatings, especially for poor Celie (Fantasia Barrino) at the hands of Mister (Domingo), who gets his comeuppance and is forgiven, and as an act of contrition decides to wear shimmery “fancy pants” to the big group hug at the end. He looked clownish but as punishments go he got off easy. The brute fact of Killers of the Flower Moon’s three-and-a-half-hour existence is something to be reckoned with, but it also emphasizes how its story is hard to endure. Scorsese’s film is truly novelistic, like a Dreiser novel—which is to say it also has the detail of a silent Stroheim film from the time in which most of it takes place, the late 1910s and 1920s, offering meticulous period set decoration, props, and wardrobe, down to the boots and driving goggles. Once again, as he has been doing at least since Goodfellas in 1990 and up through the more recent Silence and The Irishman, Scorsese presents a mentor relationship in which an older man takes a younger one under his wing so that he can exploit him by making him do his dirty work. Here, this is pushed to its extreme, as it involves the murder of a race—the Osage on their reservation in Oklahoma—and the expropriation of their oil-rich land. DiCaprio and De Niro have lost almost all expressiveness at this point in this kind of story, both of them frowny-face masks riveted in place, with all the other white people, bastards with their hands out, looking like variations on the Pep Boys. Scorsese compares them to wolves, the same way the Chinese communists in Kundun were visually equated with vultures pecking at the bones of the dead. The Osage are lost here, literally “vanishing Americans,” a racist concept hammered home by De Niro’s villain. In the film’s criminal scheme, the performances of the Native actors are swamped by the white country and Americana musicians Scorsese has cast in small roles as various murderers, thieves, and creeps. William Belleau, by contrast, is tragic and difficult to watch as the hapless Henry Roan, the melancholic, suicidal, alcoholic Osage who is befriended and discarded, shot in the head and left in the road. For the first time in a Scorsese film, however, a woman is at the center of the men’s relationship. Lily Gladstone’s Mollie, a wealthy, diabetic (she’s “got too much sugar”), and unmarried Osage comes between Dicaprio’s Ernest and De Niro’s Hale after Hale subtly sets it up for Ernest to marry her. Gladstone’s performance is unlike anything else in Scorsese’s work. She’s calm and smart, but taken in by Ernest even though she knows he’s a kind of wolf, too—“coyote wants money.” In the second half of the film, Gladstone must portray her as the martyr of the film’s sickening, deglamorized violence. She lingers between life and death, unaware she’s being poisoned by her husband as she grieves for her mother and sisters, dying one by one. Ernest starts the film as a taxi driver, reminding us of Scorsese the modernist auteur of the 1970s, who here reasserts himself outside of this naturalistic movie in its coda, where the lie of entertainment mirrors the contemporary scenes of the cleaners in The Zone of Interest. In Europe there are museums for these horrors, their history expressed in piles of shoes and eyeglasses. In America it’s called showbiz. “Yeah, well, fuck that. I’m gonna swim from Cuba to Florida” is probably the least relatable statement I’ve ever heard in a movie. Annette Bening, in the title role as Diana Nyad, however, convinces us that it’s worth doing, no matter how many times she has to try. As Diana’s ex-lover, best friend, and coach (Jodie Foster) says, “When she starts hallucinating, you go with it.” Nyad is a tribute to Diana’s self-centered delusion, which the film eventually locates in her father’s obsession with her destiny as a swimmer because he’d changed their last name to the goddess-like but fishy Nyad, and in the years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of a coach while she was a teenage Olympic swimmer in training. In the ocean she mentally escapes her past, using boomer pop hits like “The Sound of Silence” to measure her pace during these self-imposed, saltwater marathons. The film should come alive to these songs but it never quite does. A scene of a near shark attack is immediately followed by Diana just getting on with it, to the tune of Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold”—she is crossing the ocean for one, you see. Nyad was directed by the sports doc couple who made Free Solo, and follows its story closely and faithfully, never rising much above sea level. Its one hallucinatory underwater scene looks too much like it’s set at a fish-bowl castle. I couldn’t tell if that was intentional or not. Bradley Cooper’s ambitious Leonard Bernstein biopic starts out lively, presenting the world of midcentury classical music and life in the Carnegie Hall apartments as a fast-paced, same-sex romp, with Aaron Copland shouting advice from off-screen. It’s in black-and-white, too, the same way the similar 1950s milieu of New York theater is presented in Asteroid City. Soon, though, it’s in color and bisexual Lenny gets bogged down by a wife (Carey Mulligan) and a country house with a swimming pool, where, during the parties they throw, they also throw around adjectives like “big-ass” and “random” and phrases like “misread the room,” which I’m certain no one was using in the Dakota or in Connecticut in the 1970s. Mulligan’s Felicia has to put up with a lot in Bernstein. She knows what he’s like and what he needs to be happy and to do his work, and she gives up her career as an actress for him and their children, ignoring his male lovers as best she can while sliding inexorably into the lonely role of long-suffering wife. Bernstein exists parallel to her, and Cooper’s performance is daring and convincing, but something doesn’t add up. Since the film skips the 1960s, by the time we get to Felicia’s cancer, Lenny and she have aged and now look like Evel Knievel and Nancy Reagan miscast in an unhappy marriage, a change-in-mood time leap commandeered from Boogie Nights and now standard in biopics that include cocaine. Gone are the late 1950s and all of the 1960s, when Bernstein went radical chic and was doing TV shows with Miles Davis and donating money to the Black Panthers at cocktail parties in his huge apartment with Otto Preminger and Richard Avedon by his side. That’s a loss. If you have a chance to have somebody play Preminger in a movie, take it. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is closeted/not closeted, too, but his non-secret is left-wing politics and his parties are with the CPUSA. Around sexy fellow travelers he can’t help mentioning he’s read all three volumes of Capital, in German, making sure to add that Marx bored him. This tension also splits Oppenheimer into black-and-white and color. The color sections of Nolan’s film concentrate on quantum physics and show the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, the frenzy of the Trinity Test and its aftermath; the black-and-white parts follow the confirmation hearings of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission and Oppenheimer’s stealth nemesis, who is up for a seat in Eisenhower’s cabinet. Politics is for gray men; science is chromatic. Murphy inhabits Oppenheimer so completely that at times he disappears into the background of his own biopic, making it easy to understand why his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), continually implores him to fight politicos redbaiting him. Downey, freed from his iron suit and the MCU, is plunged into a hidden universe of waves and particles, where Oppenheimer casually dismisses him because he knows Strauss is in over his head. He doesn’t realize he’s paranoid, too. Downey’s performance is one of subtlety and guile, right up to the last twist. I have never seen an actor so thoroughly redeemed by taking a hard, thankless role like this. The film is cast like a Preminger movie, specifically like Advise & Consent, which it resembles in key ways: the backroom politics and endless meetings with the branches of the federal government and the panoply of stars in minor roles. Advise & Consent had Burgess Meredith and Betty White, this has Benny Safdie and Casey Affleck. Nolan often cuts their dialog within an inch of its life, making his scenes less dynamic so that their words can emphasize how high the stakes are (ending World War II; nuclear holocaust). He does make room for the romance of radiation within the drama of security clearance. When Oppenheimer meets Kitty, we’ve already seen the firework bursts of color that play in his head when he’s contemplating the motion of atoms in space, so there is an erotic charge when he explains physics to Kitty at a nighttime commie shindig in Pasadena. He looks almost into her eyes, touches hands with her, and describes the subatomic action in “this glass, this drink, this countertop, our bodies.” Later he’s part of a government group enumerating potential deaths when the A-bomb is dropped on Hiroshima, a corporate meeting that echoes similar conclaves in The Zone of Interest. These scenes of groups of men tallying mortality are an obscene cloud hovering over 2023 movies. The political activist Bayard Rustin, a contemporary of Oppenheimer and Leonard Bernstein who organized the March on Washington in 1963, was both gay and an ex-communist, so the struggles in his biopic are not going to be easy ones. Colman Domingo’s portrayal of him in George C. Wolfe’s Rustin is warm and involving, and this is a somber drama about a consequential time in our nation’s history. Yet the film’s perfunctory elements are enlivened by kitsch. Rustin mixing cocktails in his bachelor pad and playing the lute for his boyfriend was more than I expected. The film, like Oppenheimer, offers a who’s-who of its specific milieu, the Civil Rights Movement and its leaders. It’s odd that Jeffrey Wright is so much stronger in Rustin than he is in American Fiction. Here he plays Adam Clayton Powell Jr. as a self-important raconteur with a cigarette holder, a man who doesn’t know he’s past his prime as a macher in national politics and race relations. The British guy who plays Martin Luther King Jr. (Aml Ameen), on the other hand, can’t stand up to Domingo at all, or even to Chris Rock’s Roy Wilkins. I’m convinced that hiring Brits to play MLK is a continuing conspiracy to undermine his message. Somehow the FBI has taken control of the casting. The Branford Marsalis jazz score in Rustin is as tasteful as expected, the film less so. Rustin yelling “Cheese spoils! You should’ve known better!” at the movie’s moment of truth came out of nowhere, like one of those loud, low blats Lester Young used to drop into solos. Wes Anderson released five movies in 2023. Four of them are his Roald Dahl adaptations, shorts, the longest of which is The Wonderful World of Henry Sugar, at thirty-nine minutes. The others—Poison, The Swan, and The Rat Catcher—run seventeen minutes each. His feature film, Asteroid City, is a fleet 105 minutes, with no waste. That’s 195 minutes of cinema, about the same length as Killers of the Flower Moon or Oppenheimer. Bifurcated between black-and-white and color sequences, Asteroid City has a lot in common with Oppenheimer and Maestro. Its plot is clear enough, though it seemed to confuse some people, who somehow also found it thin. The film in color is a 1950s teleplay, the writing and production of which we see in black-and-white. In the play, a group of scientific whiz kids and their parents have gathered for an astronomy convention in a tiny town in the Southwest that’s located near a nuclear test site. The kids are to be presented by a government agency with achievement awards for their various inventions. During the ceremony, an alien visits to retrieve an asteroid that fell thousands of years ago. Meanwhile, two of the parents—one a famous movie actress (Scarlett Johansson), the other a roving photojournalist (Jason Schwartzman), both actors in the play—briefly fall in love before going their separate ways. Because of the sets, which were built on location, the film has an abstract quality. It draws on a rich history of midcentury drama and science, moves swiftly, nothing lingered on, it isn’t a biopic, and it makes no concessions to emotionality. In Asteroid City and these Dahl shorts, through elaborate but simple on-screen stagecraft, Anderson presents an ever-changing world of plastic beauty that he creates from the ground up. The screenplays are hyper-literate. In an unprecedented total avoidance of cheese in commercial narrative filmmaking, the act of writing and the writers doing it appear in these movies, but Anderson refrains from showing their writing on the screen in superimposition. Just by being cinema Anderson’s work now seems to some viewers avant-garde and difficult, yet also something obvious they can parody on social media—another sign of the regression of the movies into content. In Asteroid City, Rupert Friend has a minor role as a singing cowboy in the teleplay who’s later revealed to be a British actor as, of course, is Friend. That’s another unprecedented thing, to reveal the Brit under the cowboy. Friend narrates and stars in The Swan in full British mode, as an adult version of the boy in the story who is set upon my two unseen, gun-toting bullies, whom he also brings to life just through they way he delivers their dialogue. Friend’s also in The Rat Catcher as an auto mechanic with a shop next to a newspaper office. There was something so marvelous in seeing this actor in four roles, each of which he nailed, in these excellent films that did not get the recognition they deserved. J. A. Bayona’s Society of the Snow is this year’s All Quiet on the Western Front, a mishandled European remake of an American film based on a grueling historical event and a best-selling book. Bayona has become a worse director since he made The Impossible in 2012, also a disaster movie but much more cinematic and enjoyable in the way it seemed to punish a tourist family for going on vacation in Thailand right before a tsunami. As CGI has become dominant, Bayona’s work has suffered along with the cinema in general. Because of that we have to suffer, too. The one fact everyone knows about the Alive disaster is that the Uruguayan rugby players who were trapped in the snow in the Andes after their plane crashed had to resort to cannibalism to survive. Netflix is touting Society of the Snow as a “much-needed celebration of the human spirit” and downplaying the cannibalism, which is now known as “survival anthropophagy,” which doesn’t sound much nicer and is still the movie’s selling point. It is inhuman to deny that. Bayona ends the movie imitating Terrence Malick, because the boys had a religious experience, which is what having very little to eat in freezing temperatures for seventy-two straight days will do to you. I have known about the Alive disaster almost my whole life. One summer afternoon when I was about 7, on a rainy day when I had to stay in, I was sitting in the living room with my grandmother in Alton Bay, New Hampshire, watching an afternoon talk show on TV. The survivors of the crash were the guests. I had never heard of cannibalism. It was a completely new concept to me, and at first I couldn’t understand what these young men meant as they were discussing their plight with the host. When I began to get what had happened, I was horrified. I couldn’t believe it. These guys had eaten human flesh? I turned to my grandmother and quietly asked her, “Grammy, if we were in a plane crash together and I died, would you eat my skin?” She answered without taking her eyes off the TV screen. “Sometimes in very bad situations,” she said, “we have to do things we wouldn’t do under other circumstances,” ending our conversation right there. Natalie Portman plays an actress in Todd Haynes’s May December, an alarming film with a poisonous view of drama. An equally brilliant companion piece to Haynes’s Safe, from 1995, which also starred Julianne Moore, May December identifies and measures the new surfaces of banality that have emerged in our lives in the intervening twenty-eight years. Moore is Gracie, a suburban housewife in Georgia in her fifties. Twenty-three years previously she’d had an affair with a 13-year-old seventh grader, Joe (Charles Melton), got arrested for it, became a tabloid media sensation, gave birth to Joe’s son in prison, then married him when she got out. The story is in some ways similar to Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, which came out the same year as Safe, and which was rooted in the Pamela Smart case the way May December comes out of the Mary Kay Letourneau story. The present in May December is a goody-goody era in which sex crime and psychological complication have been swept under the rug. Portman arrives in Gracie and Joe’s life in the form of legitimate fame—she’s the star of a hit network-TV series called Norah’s Ark who will play Grace in an indie movie—but she’s also a duplicitous force who will rob them of their story and plunder Gracie’s odd persona (odder than in the Bergman film) along with her slight lisp. The best acted film of the year, it compares people to all sorts of animals, including snakes and coyotes as in Killers of the Flower Moon, settling on butterflies and golden retrievers. These are associated with Joe, a nice-guy father of three, now in his thirties but stunted and kept babyish by Gracie, who makes him the provider and caretaker of her frilly, conventional life. In showing Portman’s Elizabeth concentrating on “the work,” Haynes slowly reveals her as a self-centered Hollywood monster starting to understand that she’s in the presence of a bigger monster. The film associates Moore’s Gracie with pineapple upside-down cakes the way Poor Things associated Emma Stone’s Bella with Portuguese custard tarts—pastries of excess and derangement. In my late teens I was obsessed with Wim Wenders, and I was fortunate because I got to see almost all the features and shorts he made between 1968 and 1982 before I saw Paris, Texas and Wings of Desire and began to doubt him. There were a lot of Wenders film series and revivals going on then, it seemed like The American Friend was always playing somewhere, and for a brief time in the early 1980s, Wenders was revered by young cinephiles more than Godard. In retrospect it is easy to see why. A cinephile director himself, dedicated to Nicholas Ray, Wenders made films of ennui and longing set in desolate landscapes in Germany and America that showed us what we saw through the windshields of our cars. His movies went directly to the heart of the kind of men who are in them: romantic, post-punk loners who can’t express their feelings verbally and like the Kinks. In American films, I mean. And in reality. These Japanese families are so strong to me, even though I have nothing to do with them: I have nothing to do with the way they eat, or with the way they sleep, or with the way they get drunk all the time. It has nothing to do with me; and I feel so close to them that, if I had to choose, I’d rather sleep on the floor, and sit my whole life on the floor, and get drunk every day, and live in an Ozu family, than pass a single day as the son of Henry Fonda. By obliquely referring to Peter Fonda, Wenders is slagging Easy Rider and the New Hollywood generation who loved John Ford movies as much as he did, and offering a differentiator. He knows about something they don’t, and he is willing to be abject about it. All this seemed odd coming from a man who often dressed like he was auditioning for the lynch mob in Johnny Guitar, and it confused me, though it got me to watch Ozu films. I owe Wenders that. I have a feeling Wenders has not slept on the floor very much since that interview almost fifty years ago. I saw some photographs of Wenders from the Perfect Days shoot in which he is dressed in the same Tokyo Toilet cleaning uniform Hirayama (Kôji Yakusho) wears in the movie. He’s still abjecting himself. Now he’s made a movie about it. The meek Hirayama lives in a tiny apartment, sleeps on the floor, and listens to classic-rock cassette tapes in his van, which is outfitted for toilet cleaning the way the van in Kings of the Road was outfitted for fixing 35mm movie projectors. If it is raining out, Hirayama listens to a song that mentions rain (“Hey where did we go,/Days when the rains came?”); if the sun is coming up, he listens to a sunrise song (“There is a house in New Orleans/They call it the Rising Sun”). This is too on-the-nose, but like I said, simple. Here, Wenders gives us a kind of pleasant neorealism about a man who has withdrawn from life but who literally has his shit together. I thought the film was going somewhere deep into tragic territory, but no, it turns out the quiet Hirayama has a rich father. Hirayama lives the way he lives because he has rejected his family’s values—he’s proving he’s not Henry Fonda’s son. A rock song that’s not in the movie explains it: he wants to live like common people. Refugees from Africa who brave the Mediterranean to get to Europe are not doing it for personal glory like Diana Nyad. Matteo Garrone’s Io Capitano, however, suggests that in some cases they are. Seydou and Moussa (Seydou Starr and Moustapha Fall) are 16-year-old cousins in Dakar who spend their free time making up songs to perform for their neighborhood pals. Though they are fatherless and dominated by their mothers and sisters, their lives are full, with school and part-time jobs in construction. Still, they dream of going to Italy to be music stars. “White people will be asking you for autographs,” Moussa tells Seydou. As in Garrone’s remarkable, incisive movie Reality, about a man desperate to get on an unscripted television show (Grande Fratello) in his home country, Seydou and Moussa have to learn the hard way. An electronics repairman in the market (Oumar Diaw) tells them Europe is cold and crime-ridden, filled with homeless people. “You think Europe is better than Africa?” he asks them. “What you see on TV is not real.” They leave anyway, crossing the Sahara to get to Tripoli and a boat to Naples. Right away they are plunged into a precarious, dangerous world of human trafficking, violent militias, starvation, torture, and slave labor. Their journey, presented by Garrone as mythic, lyrical, and terrifying, ends with Seydou forced by Libyan gangsters to pilot the boat across the sea. Responsible for the lives of the other refugees onboard, Seydou rises to the occasion, because when you’re 16 you can do anything. Paolo Carnera’s virtuosic, unhackneyed cinematography is the co-star here. Io Capitano is an exquisitely shot film, with the warm colors of Senegal competing against the shifting tones of the desert and the rust of the boat at sea. I’m not sure if this is the most accurate version of the situation it’s presenting, but it has got to be the most beautiful. More a report on the human condition than on the banality of evil, Jonathan Glazer’s film of Nazi life next door to Auschwitz is also a Christmas card from a family of blonds in matching sweaters telling you what they’ve been doing all year. Seen as an exploitation film by people who have never seen an exploitation film, The Zone of Interest presents a series of distanced, precise tableaux, with father (Christian Friedel) going over the architectural plans of a crematorium at home in his stocking feet while mother (Sandra Hüller) tries on a fur coat upstairs and finds a used lipstick in its pocket, or tests desserts with the household staff. Do flowers scream? The off-screen space of sound in The Zone of Interest is paralleled to the scale of invisibility of the death camp, which we never see but hear in the background as Hedwig (Hüller) prepares for a garden party or goes about other activities in her family’s domestic life. Here is a single-income family with a father the head of production at the factory next door. The insistent, harrowing chill the film produces is not relieved by the fairy-tale scenes of a girl hiding food around the perimeter of the camp so that the condemned Jewish prisoners will have something to eat while they work themselves to death. Glazer shoots those scenes in some combination of camera negative and infrared photography. In one, we hear the tale of Hansel and Gretel read over the image, the part about the witch being stuffed into the oven. The story turns into one we know. Daddy is promoted and the family will have to move out of their dream house, spoiling their happy life. This is the same plot as Vincente Minnelli’s Judy Garland musical Meet Me in St. Louis, filmed in Hollywood and released in American theaters during the exact same time frame in which The Zone of Interest takes place—1943 and 1944. In Minnelli’s film, which takes place in 1903 and 1904, the father (Leon Ames) announces that he’s taking a job in New York City and the family will have to leave their idyllic life in St. Louis. Things work out and they don’t have to, which is also where The Zone of Interest ends, before its shock cut to cleaning women wiping the glass displays in the present-day Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Realizing this film’s inadvertent connection to a nostalgic MGM musical as I watched the The Zone of Interest placed it in new, even more dire perspective. Glazer’s film is a punk provocation, like the Sex Pistols’ song “Holidays in the Sun,” with Johnny Rotten singing about “the new Belsen” and “a cheap holiday in other people’s misery” as he anticipates World War III. If this film is a work of banality, banal compared to what? n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year. We also post new online-only work several times each week and publish books expanding on the interests of the magazine."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive," Let’s be honest: 2023 was not the best year for Hollywood, which dealt with its first dual actors/writers strike since 1960—with a string of mega-budget blockbusters flopping, independent and international cinema flourished. For me, 2023 will be remembered as the year of Shah Rukh Khan, where the Baadshah of Bollywood came back to the screen four times (!!!) and reclaimed his throne as the King he has been since starring in 1993’s Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. That alone made going to the movies worth it. A few movies didn’t quite make the top ten, including Magic Mike’s Last Dance, Barbie, Extraction 2, The Zone of Interest, Pathaan, All of Us Strangers, American Fiction, Poor Things, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes and Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3, but should be lauded for their attempt to break against the mold and deliver some of the most singular moviegoing experiences of 2023.  Ari Aster’s third feature film is a total hoot, even if it might not be everyone’s cup of tea. With a career-best performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who descends into total and often nightmarish amounts of madness for 179 minutes, Aster continuously assaults your patience into something that never once materializes into anything tangible but is so riotously entertaining and absurd that you can’t help but love it. Just know this: if I ever were to make a feature film and given carte blanche from a studio, I would do something like Beau is Afraid. Take that as you will.  With all of this Oscar talk, I am surprised no one is talking about Daniel Goldhaber’s How to Blow Up a Pipeline, one of the most important movies of 2023. Goldhaber’s environmentalist thriller couldn’t have arrived at a better time in a year that will be remembered as the hottest on record (until the summer of 2024). Oil lobbying groups even attempted to campaign against it when the consensus is clear: fossil fuel-driven burning is the cause of our environmental woes. Goldhaber thrillingly paints this message with the manic energy of a Safdie brothers film through its handheld camera and incessant shouting from its leads, punctuated by Gavin Brivik’s distressing Daniel Lopatin-esque score. Unfortunately, it’s a highly essential movie that isn’t being talked about enough. Here’s hoping it gets brought back into the conversation soon.  In just 91 minutes, Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott keep the laughs coming in breakneck fashion, with each massive setpiece as gut-bustingly hilarious as the last. Sennott and Ayo Edebiri have incredible chemistry, making their script feel alive and highly energetic. It was the big-screen comedy event of the year, and I’m glad to have seen it that way with a massively packed crowd.  Christopher Nolan’s latest is also his best-ever film. Fully at the height of his large-format artistic powers, he crafts a towering and monumental achievement that is highly difficult to watch but continuously thrilling through its career-best performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I may never watch Oppenheimer ever again, but I’m glad I witnessed Nolan’s biggest triumph on an IMAX screen as one of the most important cinematic documents of our time.  No, I’m not talking about the Adam Sandler Lizard movie, although it was highly entertaining and better than most animated offerings released in 2023. I’m talking about Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Vijay-starred character study on how a person’s penchant for violence can never be extinguished if they are born and raised out of violence. Parthiban says he is an ordinary person who wants to live an ordinary life, but the threat of Antony Das (Sanjay Dutt) leads him back into his old (bloody sweet) past. What’s most striking about Kanagaraj’s pictures is how he elevates his action from scene to scene and visually represents Parthiban’s psychological shift. Look at how his camera movements evolve within 164 minutes, and it’ll tell you everything you need to know about his visual-first approach and why he’s one of the best Tamil filmmakers working today.  Chad Stahelski’s opera of violence is one of the most artistically stirring movies of 2023, yet there isn’t a single Awards body even nominating it for its craft. Dan Laustsen arguably delivers the best cinematography of any movie released in 2023, giving John Wick: Chapter 4 the visual palette it needs to set it apart from literally any action movie ever released. I remain convinced it’s one of the greatest American action films ever made, which will hopefully change Hollywood’s approach to action and pave the way for stuntwork to finally be recognized as the craft it is.  Justine Triet’s latest collaboration with Sandra Hüller saw her win the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and it’s the decade’s most deserving win. Patiently revealing the drama, Triet brilliantly shoots the film in a vérité-like fashion, giving an authentic look and feel to a lead character who we aren’t sure to trust. At the end of the film, we will all have different interpretations of what we’ve seen and whether or not Sandra is guilty, but that’s the beauty of ambiguity: it’s a far better and more intelligent way of making art than spoon-feeding the audience, preventing them from thinking. Triet makes us all reflect.  Since her feature directorial debut in A Brother’s Love, Monia Chokri has single-handedly saved Québec cinema’s reputation internationally (Denis Villeneuve is currently working in the Hollywood ecosystem, mind you), with movies that are not only terrifically written but are masterclasses in visual storytelling. Collaborating for the first time with cinematographer André Turpin, the two create a rich visual language inspired by some of the greatest filmmakers for a traditionally paced but emotionally enveloping love story with two impassioned performances from Magalie Lépine-Blondeau and Pierre-Yves Cardinal. It’s the best piece of Québec cinema I’ve seen this year and sets Monia Chokri apart as one of the few singular auteurs in our cultural ecosystem.  Shah Rukh Khan’s return to Masala filmmaking perfectly showcases his acting talents for the uninitiated. Playing the dual role of Azad and Vikram Rathore, Khan exudes glorious charisma and pitch-perfect comedic timing as he continuously plays with his look and façade in front of the camera. Winking at the audience and quasi-breaking the fourth wall to deliver his most fearless monologue on the power of voting, Khan’s screen presence remains unmatched, and with the aid of Tamil director Atlee and musical director Anirudh Ravichander (who also worked on Lokesh’s Leo), he stars in his best movie since Chennai Express and will hopefully pave the way for more spectacles involving the King sooner than later.  No work of art has been more powerful in 2023 than Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. Not so much a concert film but a deeply personal look at Beyoncé Knowles-Carter beyond the public façade she has constructed for over twenty years. Yes, it could be considered a piece of hagiography, but when the music she creates is this resonating and her cinematic approach to representing the highs and lows of the Renaissance tour is so striking and evocative, it’s hard not to be emotionally swelled by how, at times, grand and operatic the concert sequences are represented, but also in how soulful the film’s quiet moments are shot. Some of the film’s purest moments do happen on stage (Diana Ross showing up to sing Happy Birthday to Beyoncé), but most of them occur when she opens herself up to the world through her relationship with daughter Blue Ivy and parents Tina and Mathew. The fact is unequivocal: no one expresses herself like Beyoncé or can even make a movie like her. Taylor Swift tried with The Eras Tour but doesn’t have the cinematic vision that Beyoncé had with her Renaissance Tour picture. It’s, in my opinion, the strongest and most powerful movie of 2023 and is still making me cry as I write these words. That’s the mark of something truly special. "
"Feb 29, 2024",positive," 2023, a real odd, but overall good, year for movies. It feels like every year, the theatrical experience is in a different kind of trouble.  This year, it was a horrific strike that limited even the ability to talk about movies publicly. Without the absolutely insane Barbenheimer event, who knows where we would be.  But this year also contained some legitimate classics of the form and I had a great time at the cinemas throughout the entire calendar.  Yeah, this one might seem out of left field. Or maybe you haven’t heard of it. I don’t consider myself an expert in Indian cinema.  But I am an expert in me having a good time. You like musicals? Romance? Comedy? Family drama and history? This movie has all of that and more. Ranveer Singh is a perfect, lovable, idiot.  He doesn’t know much, but his heart is in the right place. And Alia Bhatt? Perfection and I won’t hear any arguments. This is a long movie, but it never feels like it.  It’s a movie that makes me smile even when thinking about it. Do yourself a favor, find this movie and watch it. Thank me later. I find it interesting that as Yorgos Lanthimos gets more freedom, he becomes more approachable (as long as you’re not a prude about sex). Poor Things being this low on the list just shows you what a great year we had in 2023. Emma Stone deserves all of the praise that she is getting, but I only hope that Mark Ruffalo gets the awards attention, too. He is on a special comedic level here. But also, visually, this is one of the stunners of the year. Lanthimos clearly does not care about realism and uses the fantastical to allow us to just join in on both the wildness and the journey of his characters. I’m just going to be clear here. Trace Lysette gave the best performance of the year. That’s it. She is absolutely perfect. And as she has been discussing on social media, if a cisgender person gave this performance, it would be a guaranteed nomination, if not win. Barring a huge surprise, this will not happen for Ms. Lysette. But don’t let that dissuade you. Monica was one of my favorite theater experiences of the year. A silent discussion of depression, familial trauma, and small moments of healing. This is what watching independent film in particular, and cinema in general, is all about. I saw this movie early in the year and it has stuck with me, and even improved with time. What to say that hasn’t been said. I am a lover of Christopher Nolan films, and this is his true epic. In scale, in story, in pure gall. And yet, unlike many epics, Oppenheimer is an actor’s dream. Obviously, Cillian Murphy is great, and this has been talked to death. But the gigantic cast, they are all just right and serve the movie in ways that supporting characters rarely do. Yet, despite this, Nolan also never loses sight of the bombast necessary to tell this particular story. He manages to do it all; character work, special effects, biopic, and a lesson movie without feeling preachy. Kind of a miracle now that I think of it! And here is the second best performance of the year. Sandra Hüller truly makes you forget that she is acting. You can literally pick any moment in the movie from her as her awards clip. And if you know me, you know that I do not appreciate most child performances. But Milo Machado-Graner is different. A truly moving, stunning performance and story. We can argue all day about whether she did it or not (She’s innocent!) but that may be the most uninteresting conversation in the whole film. Anatomy of a Fall is so good and intimate, it almost feels like you shouldn’t be seeing it. I wrote a whole review of this on this site. Scorsese, incredibly, has not lost a step. This movie contains a performance so powerful that it makes you forget that she is acting against titans like DiCaprio and DeNiro. Lily Gladstone will likely be the first Native American person to win an Oscar, and good for her, she deserves it. Martin Scorsese really is a master, he finds a way to teach us both our part in tragedy, and our responsibility as those who devour this media. His choices in the final moments will stick with me for many, many years.  I am an easy mark for this kind of movie. You want Dave to support your movie? Just make it about longing.  This has longing in spades. I am still in disbelief that this was director Celine Song’s first feature. It is assured, calm, and has more depth than many experienced filmmakers. Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro create relationships that seem like peering into both past and future. The possibilities, the way our lives fork, this movie says it all without spoon feeding and saying it out loud. Past Lives is a treasure and will continue to be for many years.  All of Us Strangers is heartbreaking. All of Us Strangers is heart healing. For those of us who have had to come out of the closet, it tells a truth rarely told. Most of the stories are all accepting or all rejecting. But often, life is not like this. The coming out story here is neither, it is performed by people, real humans with faults and struggles. But beyond this, All of Us Strangers is also a beautiful love story, kind of (watch it, you’ll get what I mean). Both Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal are a perfect fit for their roles and for each other. All of Us Strangers is a beautiful, important, painful watch, and worth every second. Another film that I was lucky enough to review for InSession Film. Although it was surpassed in my list of best films, this is likely the one I will come back to most. If it’s not the best food movie ever, it is just behind the great Tampopo. Love is food. Food is love. Age and time don’t matter. Love will conquer everything, even if only for a short time. The Taste of Things lives in my heart and probably always will. I will admit, this could be recency bias. It also could be that Jonathan Glazer is exactly on my wavelength. Even more than most movies set during the Holocaust, The Zone of Interest, is truly difficult to watch. But the difficulties come for different reasons. There is almost no violence witnessed on screen, very little suffering besides the background sounds that we hear. Glazer spends the entire run time building to a daring moment in the third act. In this moment, you realized that the accusatory is not pointed solely at the evil Germans, but at humanity in general. This movie shook me to my core, and if you can move past the achingly slow pace, it will for you, too."
"Feb 1, 2024",positive," Christopher Nolan’s sprawling biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, after a slow-moving opening to set the backstory, finally comes into its own with the countdown before the Trinity test near Los Alamos, New Mexico confirmed that an atomic bomb would work. Supposedly that site was chosen as no civilians were living in the area, yet Indigenous inhabitants did. Whether any of those were injured by the blast and fallout is never mentioned. In the title role, Cillian Murphy fits the physical, emotional and intellectual requirements of the daunting role to a T. Oscar will be taking notice. Long-suffering, former communist wife, Kitty, is in good hands due to Emily Blunt’s wide-ranging performance—especially her palatable disdain for those jealous of her husband’s fame and success. The only narrative weakness being her “constant cocktail” habit, which soon becomes tiresome. Florence Pugh gives a commendable take on the forever communist, sometime lover of the intrepid scientist who definitely moves up in his profession as head of the Manhattan Project in a small but most important role, Tom Conti fires on all cylinders as Albert Einstein (kudos to the makeup and hair department) who, naturally, provides telling advice and prediction of the future for Oppenheimer the villain of the piece (and in real life) comes in the selfish, treacherous form of Lewis Strauss—Atomic Energy Commission chairman and Eisenhower cabinet wannabe. Robert Downey Jr. digs into the role with copious venom and ambition as required. The most notable aspect of this production is Nolan’s decision to let viewers’ imaginations fill in the truly horrific results of the A-bombs landing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are hints of that in some of the black-and-white “vague” images, then later, assurances from President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, a readily believable occupant of the White House) that he was responsible for the bombings—not Oppenheimer (dubbed father of the atomic bomb in the media). Once the “dust” settles (and the war ends) the remainder of the film delves into Oppenheimer’s appearances in a kangaroo court (setup “anonymously” by Strauss to feed his political ambitions). Sadly, importantly, those hearings are all too close to the ongoing trials and tribulations for a former president whose crimes are—like Strauss’—revenge-driven but far removed from actual facts. The timing couldn’t have been better. As always, Nolan’s non-linear storytelling (based on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin), keeps the mind engaged even as the adroit cinematography from Hoyte van Hotema and superb editing, thanks to Jennifer Lame, becomes a visual feast. The artistic icing on this generous cake comes in the form of copious amounts of nervous strings and forceful brass heard in Ludwig Göransson’s most effective original score."
"Jan 25, 2024",positive,"Pugh is heartbreaking, but doesn't get to shine as much as Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty). Long-suffering thanks to her husband's obsessive career and dalliances, Blunt nonetheless provides needed steel for Bob in the final scenes."
"Jan 3, 2024",positive," Roger Ebert, the father of modern film criticism, loved that quote. He knew that no critic can ever be objective, and they shouldn’t try to be. Every time we watch a film, we view it through the prism of our own experiences. Critics can lean on their knowledge of film history, their understanding of the technical aspects of filmmaking, and their ardent passion for cinema to comprise an informed judgment on a movie’s merits, but that doesn’t begin to account for the most important thing: why a film sticks with you. What makes it lodge in your gut and stick there for days, months, even years afterward? It’s a thing that cannot be explained because it occurs in that meeting place between an artist—or the team of artists and craftspeople who make a film—and the individual viewer. When you get right down to it, the only difference between a very good film and a great one is how much each of us personally connects to its ideas and how they’re expressed. For this critic, 2023 was a hard year. I’ll spare you the full details, but it involved the loss of several beloved family pets, the deterioration of one of my most important personal relationships, and a lot of therapy. There was both grief and loss. I withdrew a bit from the world. At some point, I stopped reading the news; at another point, I finished a book on baseball cinema that will be published next year. I leaned in to my passions and away from that which I had no control over. I ceased reviewing new releases and took on the repertory cinema beat here at City Paper. Revisiting the films of the past has been enlightening, but it has also left me feeling a little out of touch. As a critic, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as groupthink is poisonous to honest discourse. I have found myself out of step with my colleagues on some of the most celebrated films of the year including Oppenheimer (I liked it, but thought the third act nearly cratered the whole thing), Barbie, and Killers of the Flower Moon. Instead, I found myself drawn to smaller independent films that portrayed and probed the simple pleasures of life: art, food, desire, family, love, and friendship. Films like Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret. (#5), the warm adaptation of the beloved Judy Blume novel about a Jewish teenager growing up in suburban New Jersey in the ’70s. It’s a film that finds universality in specificity, and not just its perfect replication of ’70s-era fashion, furniture, and cars. It captures the low-stakes anguish of puberty with startling insight. I don’t know what it’s like to buy tampons or worry about being the last person in your friend group to get their period … but I do know what it’s like to buy condoms before you need them and fret that you’re going to be the oldest virgin on the planet. Written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig, the film feels like a callback to the era of John Hughes—when we laughed at teenagers so we didn’t cry for ourselves. One of the great achievements of Are You There God? is in how it expands the role of the mother, played winningly by Rachel McAdams. She has little to do in the book, but the film delves honestly into her ambivalence over being a homemaker and her complicated relationship with her parents. The compassion the film extends her reminds me of All of Us Strangers (#4), a haunting romance about a lonely urbanite (Andrew Scott) who, after striking up a romance with a sexy neighbor (Paul Mescal), finds himself drawn back to his hometown, where his parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy), who died in a car crash when he was a child, are miraculously still alive and unaged. The romance is steamy enough—Scott and Mescal forge a chemistry that is both emotionally vulnerable and unbearably sexy—but Scott achieves a remarkable transformation in the scenes at home, when he reveals his sexual identity to his parents. It’s somewhere between a wish and a dream, with Scott becoming the 11-year-old boy he once was without the aid of makeup or visual effects. You don’t need big budgets or movie stars to create dramatic tension. Just look to Palm Trees and Power Lines (#6) and The Teachers’ Lounge (#7). Palm Trees was dropped on Hulu earlier this year after a festival run in 2022. Nobody seemed to notice it, or maybe the subject matter scared them off. It’s about 17-year-old Lea (Lily McInerny), who, bored and disgusted with her school friends, embarks on a romance with a 34-year-old guy (Jonathan Tucker). Discerning adults will realize the trouble from the first time they lock eyes, but first-time feature director and co-writer Jamie Dack shows incredible discipline in letting her story play out through Lea’s perspective. When you get to the horrifying climax, it’s both unthinkable and inevitable. Given the subject matter and the creative tightrope in pulling it off, it’s courageous work from all involved. The Teachers’ Lounge plays out more like a traditional thriller, though without the explicit threat of violence. The German film by İlker Çatak concerns a new teacher at a public school dealing with an epidemic of theft. Her attempt to catch the thief seems to bring a quick resolution, but nothing is simple in our world as it pertains to children, safety, and criminality. Leonie Benesch is revelatory as the idealistic teacher trying to do the right thing at every turn and somehow getting herself in deeper with her students, their parents, and eventually her colleagues. Is it possible to do the right thing in our world? Is it even worth it? The Teachers’ Lounge asks those questions and smartly doesn’t try to answer them.  Maybe we should “just keep telling the story.” That’s the advice the playwright gives  the actor in Asteroid City (#9), Wes Anderson’s exploration of terrestrial and extraterrestrial life. Set at a Junior Stargazing convention in a small desert town, Anderson bounces his cast of troubled adults and observant children against each other, while building in a nesting doll narrative structure, and painting some of the richest, most pleasing hues of his career. As I pondered the loss of my beloved dogs this year, did I relate to Jason Schwartzman’s grieving widower? Did I spend a few nights gazing at the stars and pondering my place in the universe? Did I worry about how to tell the children—my remaining dogs—the news? Yes, I did. But I also warmly recalled Anderson’s blue desert sky once or twice, amid months of thinking about how we use art to both heal and relive our traumas.  Or we could just rely on each other. That’s how the central trio in The Holdovers (#8) gets through a mercilessly cold two weeks at a New England boarding school. It’s Christmas vacation, and they have nowhere else to go. Angus (newcomer Dominic Sessa) has been abandoned by his mother and new stepdad; Mr. Hunham (Paul Giamatti) has drawn the short straw and been tasked with supervising Angus; and cafeteria manager Mary (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, in a performance that’s already winning awards) has to stick around and make sure the men don’t die of starvation. Each character is prickly in their own way, but they quickly warm to one another. Their time (and ours) is spent trying to help each other heal, making The Holdovers the warmest film of director Alexander Payne’s career, if not one of his best. Certainly the one I needed at the end of this year. There’s also a warmth in Showing Up (#10) and Afire (#3), although it doesn’t seem like it at first. Kelly Reichardt’s Showing Up opens on a frustrated sculptor (Michelle Williams) rushing an injured pigeon out of her window so it can die in the street. Afire concerns itself with a miserable writer (Thomas Schubert) whose vacation with his best friend is nearly ruined by his own defensiveness. Neither character is particularly sympathetic at the outset. The only reason they earn our compassion is from how caringly they are portrayed by the filmmaker (Christian Petzold) and actors. Over the course of these films, we get to know and love these fictional artists not because they’re flawless people but because, simply, they are people, with all their flaws and complexities. Williams and Schubert play characters who would be fast friends if they ever met—their insecurities would join them at the hip—but they have to scrape and claw for every little bit of peace in the world. In watching them find it, we might find a little peace for ourselves. I had the same wish for the anonymous protagonist of David Fincher’s The Killer (#2), and I might have been the only one. Many otherwise intelligent people found this to be a cold and calculating genre exercise. I thought it was one of the warmest and funniest films of the year. The film opens with our anonymous protagonist (Michael Fassbender) preparing for a job, demonstrating and explaining to us in a hilarious voice-over the discipline that it takes to perform his task well. He shares personal mantras—“Forbid empathy”; “Fight only the battle you’re paid to fight”—that seem to have been taken from a 21st-century dude-bro self-help book.  He makes clear that these rules are the very foundation of his life—then he proceeds to break every one of them. The Killer is certain he is one thing but shows us with his every decision that he’s actually another. It makes him a fool, a tragic hero, and an avatar for every adult living on this planet. If you accept the framework of The Killer’s life—that he commits murder for a living—you can see him striving toward connection and compassion within it. It’s there in the way he murders a cab driver quickly and without warning, sparing him from, as another character later puts it, the worst nightmare of being aware of your impending death (wait, isn’t that all of us?). It’s there in his aliases, all of which represent characters from ’70s and ’80s sitcoms. It’s like he’s waiting for some bank teller or rental car associate to recognize the name Sam Malone and share a laugh with him, but they never do. Hardly a genre exercise, The Killer is a self-referential work in which Fincher acknowledges his own reputation as a controlling director and digs under the surface to find the quivering child beneath. He’s there, but you have to look for him. Speaking of quivering, my favorite film of the year is The Taste of Things (#1), the most tender film of 2023. I regret that it won’t hit most theaters until Feb. 14, but I can’t imagine a more perfect release date than Valentine’s Day. The French romance chronicles the relationship between Dodin (Benoît Magimel), a 19th-century landowner, and his cook and sometimes lover, Eugenie (Juliette Binoche). It opens on a 20-minute scene of the duo preparing an extravagant meal for Dodin and his friends, and while it’s one of the most sensual experiences ever put on film—you can hear every knife cutting through flesh and smell every simmering roux—it never tips over into what we would today call food porn. It’s not a film for people who use pleasure to escape life. It’s for those who believe food is art, and art is life. So is love. Dodin and Eugenie share a bed every now and then. He wants them to marry. She simply wants to be his cook and lover. Is this simply the most French film ever made, endorsing food as religion and a relationship between a boss and his woman employee as not only acceptable, but ideal? Sure, that’s one way to see it. I’d say it bathes you in ephemerality, arguing in its gentle, naturalistic aesthetic that you can savor life without trying to hold onto it. In the end, life will prove it to you, anyway. Enjoy yourself while you’re here. Get to know yourself and others. Know who the man is watching that movie, for the more you know yourself, the more you can know the world. We don't have one.

"Jan 1, 2024",positive," Oppenheimer, inspired by the book American Prometheus, which Robert Pattinson gifted to director Nolan, recounts J. Robert Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) life, beginning with his school years, moving through the dropping of the atom bomb, and ending with his security hearing. Even as a young adult, physics and the inner workings of the world fascinate, so much so that he’s distracted from life in front of him, other sciences, socialization, and relationships.  While in school, he meets Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz) who is already familiar with his work. This leads to a meeting with Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), and eventual recruitment by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) for Harvard. Upon accepting the job, and with few students signing up for his classes, he befriends Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) and is eventually recruited again, only this time by the government.  General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) wants Oppenheimer to catch America up in the arms race. This leads to the development, thanks to ingenuity, of The Manhattan Project. The science doesn’t quite exist and much of what they’re doing is an experiment, but amid Communism scares, WWII, and scandal, the project leaders and scientists make the deadline for the test. Few of them are prepared for the quickness with which the American government takes the project away. Oppenheimer is stunned and tortured because of the devastation and guilt, but President Truman (Gary Oldman) takes the blame.  The president does not take Oppenheimer’s advice that the country re-examine America’s use of the bomb though. It’s too late. J. Robert Oppenehimer’s late life leads to a review of his security clearance which is almost concurrent with one of his original supporters and recruiters, Senator Strauss, seeking to gain approval for his nomination as Secretary of Commerce. The beauty of that summary doesn’t lie in the fact that the summary is historical and obviously pushes back against spoilers. The beauty is how that traditional timeline is stretched and deviated by Nolan in a way that only he can. Nolan is a master of adding tension where there is very little, while deflating strenuous moments and creating an environment that is almost unbearable. Oppenheimer ebbs between tension and stress, manipulating time in a way reminiscent of Dunkirk, which I often label as Nolan’s perfect work. Weeks after the release of Nolan’s latest and I’m not sure about my rankings anymore. Nolan’s fictional work is what he’s often known for but the work he’s doing by reimagining history might be what cements his career. One of the key elements of the film is sound and how it’s withheld and overdone. The audience won’t hear explosions when they expect them, yet we do experience an abundance of cacophony, including cheering, applause, and mechanization. Oppenheimer isn’t all sound either. It’s visually stunning and delicate, light when possible and dark when necessary. One of the few criticisms of the film, which continues a necessary discussion that’s never finished, is the portrayal of women and their overall absence. Women were disproportionately represented in the field of science during the time of The Manhattan Project. 3.8% of women held a college degree at the time, so their presence on location wasn’t expected, yet some audience members, myself included, couldn’t get past how Oppenheimer interacted with women, regardless of whether the interactions were realistic or not.  His friend and hidden partner Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) never meets his wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), though they have one scene together; the female students, secretaries, and scientists don’t interact with one another either. The film overtly fails the adopted Bechdel test, continually noted as a joke, yet the joke still compels people to inquire if a film sidelines an entire gender. The test highlights moments audiences may casually overlook, but maybe this movie doesn’t really need to pass it anyway. Oppenheimer was deemed a womanizer in the movie and the lack of female characters interacting is a reflection of that. There are two additional ideas that might undercut that claim though: in general, Nolan doesn’t typically write about female characters—there’s a debate about representation with Murphy (Jessica Chastain) and Brand (Anne Hatheway) in Interstellar—and additionally the main women in the film fall into the mistress and wife/mother category a little too easy. This may underscore Oppenheimer’s use of them in this way, but nevertheless, I did find it unfortunate to see the reduction. Maybe this comes back to the idea and claim long before the film’s debut that we don’t need more stories about powerful, small, white men, even though the interpretation of their stature by the end is remarkable. What impresses me most about Oppenheimer is Nolan’s trajectory. Many fans began following his career after his work on Batman, moving backwards to catch some of his more grounded work like Memento. Though I personally haven’t seen The Following yet, I appreciate that, similar to a poet, Nolan is often telling the same story repeatedly just with refined techniques. He’s always curious about humanity and what makes a person human. It’s the through-line on all of his work, whether we’re watching Bruce Wayne recover from trauma by giving up his humanity or soldiers on the shore of Dunkirk mustering the last ounces.  Nolan is one of the few directors whose themes barely change while the outward dressing is always shifting.  The techniques are similar as well, but he harnesses them more and more over time. Everyone entered Oppenheimer curious how Nolan would create a bomb with practical effects, no CGI, and minimal VFX work. He is a master and only the best can do what he does, the withholding of what audiences want or expect, the delayed gratification, and reassembly later on in a schema we weren’t expecting. Developing the atom bomb was a heinous act. It’s one of hundreds of low moments for mankind. But what I appreciate about everyone involved is that the film refuses to create winners. Every character is so small by the close of the 3-hour film. Whether they admit it or not, they are changed. J. Robert Oppenheimer is the smallest of anyone by film’s end. Still a man, scientist, and great mind, but lesser, and Nolan makes that undeniable. It’s been several weeks and I’d still rank this a 5 out of 5. If you were intimidated by Barbenheimer or the sold-out, 24/7 IMAX seats, make sure to catch this before it leaves theaters. Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians takes bold risks in reimagining the iconic series for a new audience as the heart of the show lies in its young heroes."
"Jan 1, 2024",positive," Oppenheimer is not a joy to behold. But it is a fascinating motion picture everyone should see…and absorb. It is also likely to be heralded at the Oscars as Best Picture.  As a Boomer, the film personally connects. Being a high school varsity debater in 1965, I verbally sparred about the threat of nuclear war with Russia. “Peaceful Coexistence” was an oft used term—coming from teens who had “ducked and covered” in classroom drills during the 1950s. It was all about the threat of the atomic bomb, which by the mid ‘60s had escalated to the hydrogen bomb. Twenty years earlier, in 1945, WWII ended with our atom bombs devastating Japan.  The story structure begins during Oppenheimer’s 1926 university year and stays its course through nuclear discoveries in the late 1930s to WWII developments (both military and scientific) and then to postwar years with Presidents Truman through Johnson.  Oppenheimer’s (Murphy) love life is included, focusing on dating Jean Tatlock (Pugh), a Communist Party member. This was the beginning of the upending of Oppenheimer’s controversial political leanings. Not only does he have friends who are Communist Party members, but ends up marrying Katherine “Kitty” (played by Blunt), an ex-member. It is no surprise that the brilliant scientist becomes the focus of House Un-American Activities accusations. His personal life becomes fodder for political retribution, despite the fact his Quantum Physics expertise led to the development and eventual dropping of the atom bomb on Japan that ended WWII.  A major player in the movie is Robert Downey Jr., who does a fine job as Oppenheimer’s nemesis, Lewis Strauss. The Atomic Energy Commission’s Chairman, Strauss, held a long time resentment of Oppenheimer, and used his testimony to strip Oppenheimer of security clearance. Thus, Oppenheimer was blocked from anything to do with nuclear research. This sequence occurs in the third hour of the film. Before that happens, we witness Oppenheimer in full power as he heads a team in Los Alamos, New Mexico to develop a nuclear bomb to end the war.  It is fascinating to witness the re-creation of that town built to house the scientists and technicians (and their families) while work proceeds. It all had to do with privacy and expediency. And it worked. Interestingly, the film’s structure is laced with flashback sequences necessary for context references. Also, much of the story is narrated by Strauss/Downey Jr. To minimize any confusion regarding the story’s point-of-view, director Nolan chose to film Oppenheimer’s sequences in color. Strauss’s stances are shown in black and white. The result is subtle and clarifying. It truly helps in a movie as complex as Oppenheimer certainly is.  Oppenheimer is packed with outstanding performances, particularly by the mostly unknown Cillian Murphy. He not only greatly resembles the brooding main character, but is totally believable.  There were things about the famous during those years I found fascinating. Take Albert Einstein, as portrayed by Tom Conti. And I am still jarred by the persona of President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman). I will not detail the latter here, but I had to research it after seeing the film to verify he did indeed say such to and about Dr. Oppenheimer. "
"Jan 1, 2024",positive," Following The Film Stage’s collective top 50 films of 2023, as part of our year-end coverage, our contributors are sharing their personal top 10 lists. After 2022 left me feeling a bit out in weeds in regards to film culture (both the state of movies in general, and especially the ones that got people the most amped up that kept leaving me disappointed), I came into 2023 a pessimist and left with a rejuvenated belief that the movies are, indeed, back. This year was overflowing with riches, to the point where even up until this very moment I’m mentally swapping in and out some titles for the list you’re about to see of my annual favorites. There’s just too many gems I don’t want to leave behind, and they came in all shapes and sizes. From some of my favorite directors making highly anticipated returns (including one for their final feature) to filmmakers I’ve always been cold on for the first time making something that has nestled its way into my heart and promises to remain there for eternity. The even bigger surprise is that, while not all of my personal selections are in the mix for major awards attention, it’s actually looking pretty solid that a large portion of them will. Somehow the sky has opened up, and things look bright again.  That makes my list feel perhaps a little pedestrian—certainly more than last year, in which not a single one of my top ten selections earned an Academy Award nomination—but I’ve definitely got some more esoteric choices thrown into the mix as well.  To see my full ranking of 2023 releases, you can check out my list on Letterboxd. There, you’ll also find my ranked list of all the non-2023 titles that I saw for the first time this year. That selection is highlighted by Between the Lines, The Bridges of Madison County, Choose Me, T.R. Baskin, Victims of Sin and Rolling Thunder.  A tender little romance between two people isolated from much of society, cast down and out as they make their way through the days until by chance they find a connection with one another, Fallen Leaves rides the wave between gentle transcendence and inimitable cool. Our Finnish comp to Jim Jarmusch, Aki Kaurismäki is in top form with another feature that gives you the urge to smoke a cigarette and hit the town at night. Through the romance, Fallen Leaves takes on some larger themes, tackling notions of masculinity and the many layers of what it actually means to be a man—which isn’t hiding from your problems in isolation or in the bottle. It’s also disarmingly funny at times, with Kaurismäki’s dry as sandpaper wit really shining in moments that had me in stitches—probably one of the most hilarious movies of the year.  If The Burial had come out 15 years ago, I probably would have given it a C+ and called it unremarkable. In 2023, it feels like a revelation. A ’90s throwback courtroom drama with two A-listers and a strong supporting cast. A mixture of character introspection, rich macro themes, legal investigation, and a David vs Goliath battle. An honestly surprising amount of genuinely effective comedic bits. Margaret Betts navigates the more interesting-than-you’d-expect tone of this so well, aided by a stellar Jamie Foxx performance at the head, perfectly instilling a showboating ambulance-chasing huckster persona with deep-rooted insecurities that start to crack and a desire to do something greater. Tommy Lee Jones dials back the curmudgeon vibes for a really sincere performance of a belittled everyman who wants to see these exploitative vampires pay. They’re an odd pairing who work really well together, and you get invested in seeing their parallel journey for the cause. The Burial is an unbelievably charming slice of comfort food, the type of movie we took for granted when it was all the rage and now doesn’t exist anymore. Inspired by the likes of Visconti’s The Innocent, Akerman’s Je, Tu, Il, Elle and Ripploh’s Taxi zum Klo, Ira Sachs delivers the best film of his career with the steamy tale of Tomas (Franz Rogowski, continuing to make the argument that he’s our finest actor), the dictionary definition of a chaotic bisexual. As Tomas tears through lovers old (Ben Whishaw’s Martin, his husband) and new (Adèle Exarchopoulos’s Agathe, the woman he cheats with), we wonder just what kind of wreckage he’ll unleash upon those in his orbit next. There’s an intoxicating roller coaster of emotions that Passages takes us on, the sort of train wreck we can’t look away from. Tomas is infuriating, exhausting, and yet in some strange ways admirable—he’s unabashedly himself, down to his dynamic fashion choices that rank among the best costume design of the year. Also in the best of the year conversation is Josée Deshaies’ cinematography, using ingenious framing and blocking techniques to emphasize the torrential emotional interiority of the characters in every scene. White man’s greed is a volatile thing, so easily manipulated into carnage, so fragile and always on the lookout for threats. Whether it’s money, sex, or land, it all boils down to one thing: power. The power they’ve held for so long, and the power they refuse to relinquish in any capacity. The machinery of white supremacy is the center of Killers of the Flower Moon, and unlike Scorsese’s many cautionary tales depicting the folly of greedy men, there’s no fun to be had here. No invitation into the thrill of the moment. Like The Irishman, Scorsese’s latest has a funereal tone to it, but it’s not a eulogy for these men, for this way of life, for the realization that they’ve lived it all for nothing — it’s a eulogy for a country, for an entire culture of people who are being washed away by the unrelenting violence of white men. After a staggering meta moment where the director turns the lens on himself and his own place within the machine, Flower Moon crescendos with a powerful drumming, a statement that after all of this, the Osage live on. They’ll still tell their stories the way they always have, they’ll still look after each other, they’ll still beat these drums and their fight won’t surrender. The Killer feels like the Rosetta Stone for David Fincher: the core of his entire thesis as an artist. A man who exists in exactitudes, in process and efficiency, yet he’s undone by the unpredictability of human beings and the mercy of having to operate within the structures of our modern world. It is also, like Fincher himself, remarkably funny in a wry, unassuming way—whether it’s the opening 20-minute sequence of the eponymous figure telling us how he’s a calculated master of his game only to screw the pooch in the most obvious way possible, the cheeky product placement, like Michael Fassbender describing why he gets McDonald’s every day because it’s the perfect way to blend in as a cold-blooded murderer, or sight gags like the dog busting through the glass door. At the same time, it’s an incredibly engaging process movie, as we watch this man execute plans step by step, see them play out perfectly or have to watch him adapt when things go awry. It’s lean, mean, and remarkably efficient, just like the character and just like Fincher. The final feature of legendary filmmaker William Friedkin, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial sent him out on a high. Remarkably bold in its formal and aesthetic approach, the courtroom drama is practically Bressonian in its minimalism and removal from conventional cinematic attributes. Almost the entire picture is composed of tight shots on the actors (including one final riveting performance from the late Lance Reddick), less than ten of them contained in this one setting where a series of witnesses are called to sit in a chair and be grilled by opposing lawyers. We are in this room for these two hours and that’s it. We see it all unfold, and it’s up to us to make interpretations or judgments, if we wish, as to who these people really are. It’s absolutely gripping cinema. A violent reckoning with America’s bloodlust, filtered through a man whose ego and naïveté facilitated one of the most unspeakable monstrosities in the history of the world; an unprecedented devastation that still reverberates through civilizations today. Wisely, Oppenheimer never paints the man as a victim nor as a tortured genius. He’s something else entirely. An explorer who doesn’t stop to think about what his discovery will mean. A man who tries to be neutral, who doesn’t have a stance. He believes he has morality, but there’s no conviction — or if there is, it’s overrun by his need for fame and the blinders he puts on to the real world. That’s a more damning statement than anything else: that he can destroy so much, and end up on the cover of TIME magazine as some sort of hero. Oppenheimer leaves us with the unshakable threat of nuclear holocaust hanging over us but it’s not just that. It’s any of the many ways that men in suits have destroyed our world to line their pockets, whether it’s the plenty of other genocides that have occurred, economic disparity, the annihilation of the climate, the scours of people who have died due to a preventable virus because these people left the world to rot. The latest masterpiece from Christian Petzold, one of our finest filmmakers, Afire is catnip for insecure, resentful, bitter, and judgmental writers who are decently talented but not nearly as good as they think they are or want to be. In other words, this had me eating out of the palm of its hand. Stepping away from the semi-mythic tales Petzold’s been weaving in his past three features, this is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes scathing, always gripping jaunt that’s clearly in conversation with the works of Éric Rohmer. As light on its feet as Afire is, there’s also an indictment of that very fact, as these characters find themselves so consumed by their petty foibles and narcissism while less than 50km away forest fires are wreaking havoc through communities and wildlife. They are constantly faced with how meaningless all of this actually is, and yet they can’t help themselves. None of us can. The world will always revolve around us, even when we can see the tragedy right in front of our eyes. It’s okay, it won’t hit us. It’s just over there. Until it’s not. Alexander Payne has expressed issues with people describing The Holdovers as a “cozy” film, but in doing so he’s misinterpreting what people mean by that. Cozy doesn’t mean saccharine or schmaltzy. This film is certainly not that. Beyond the inherently cozy nature of the story’s setting in time period, location and season, the coziness comes from its gentle, gradual unraveling of its characters’ layers. The coziness comes from allowing us the gift of time and space to simply exist with these three people and learn about them as they learn about each other. To grapple with their griefs, their melancholy, their anger, their disappointment, the same way that we grapple with our own. The Holdovers is a bitter movie, but it’s not a cynical one. It finds value in the small victories, even if that’s just as small as having someone sit next to you so you feel less alone when you’re completely alienated from the rest of the world. 2023 was the year of the courtroom drama (see #4 and #8, and parts of both #3 and #6), and Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or winner brought us into the specifically nutty circus of the French court system, where a woman is put to the task of defending herself against accusations of murdering her husband. A riveting investigation occurs on the stand as she’s hounded by a supremely snarky prosecutor and the media puts her under the microscope, but what’s most fascinating about Anatomy of a Fall is its slow dissection into the anatomy of the marriage itself. Each scene uncovers new layers in their relationship, exploring the ways in which we all build up resentment, ache, jealousy, and sometimes even rage over time. Were any of our spouses to perish under unusual circumstances, would we not also be the most glaring suspect?  Mitchell Beaupre is the Senior Editor at Letterboxd, and currently based out of Newark, Delaware.

"Dec 30, 2023",positive," 2023 was the year audiences – post-Covid – rediscovered their love of theatrical releases. Going to the movies became worthy again with embrace of the contrasting “Barbie” by Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” by Christopher Nolan being released the same day, a box-office showdown that went viral as “Barbenheimer.” Both became top-grossing films, a pleasant surprise in an arena so often occupied by superheroes, reboots and sequels.  Jonathan Glazer’s rendering of the banality of evil captivates. In tight close-ups, we watch as a German family tries to create an idyll for themselves in a slice of heaven with a big lawn that spawns self-sustaining life, tended to by Hedwig, played by “Anatomy of a Fall” star Sandra Hüller. When the camera pulls out, we see billowing smoke in the near distance. It’s just one sign of the heinous ills in the hands of this family: The patriarch, played by Christian Friedel, is real-life Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss, and behind the high wall that abuts the family home is the Auschwitz concentration camp. We hear screaming and gunfire in the distant background as the family goes about its daily life. The film is an exhaustive endurance test – as it should be. There’s brutalism to Glazer’s filmmaking, the hard edges and severity of editing and sound design superb and eliciting a sense of nauseating dread. Still, Glazer takes pains to ensure we only hear the horrors, questioning the morality of making them cinematic. (Ally Johnson) Coming soon to theaters. A contemporary Manhattan family’s comfortable routine gets disrupted when writer and teacher Beth Mitchell (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and her sister, Sarah (Michaela Watkins), overhear Beth’s husband, therapist Don Mitchell (Tobias Menzies, “Game of Thrones”), confide to his brother-in-law Mark (Arian Moayed, “Succession”) that he does not like his wife’s new novel. Writer-director Nicole Holofcener reunites with Louis-Dreyfus to outdo their independent dramedy hit “Enough Said” (2013), with Holofcener per usual capturing the realistic yet casual ebb and flow between work, home and leisure and creating organic, three-dimensional characters. Louis-Dreyfus and Menzies anchor the film as a long-married, still-in-love couple who must find their way from rupture to repair. At the epicenter are well-intentioned lies that the film’s hypothesis has it are the lubricant that makes relationships work, while honesty makes each character question their grasp of reality, self-worth and professional choices. Beth’s story is the film’s drive, but Don’s world is arguably more compelling because of the exposure of his work and potpourri of patients, including real-life wife and husband Amber Tamblyn and David Cross playing a miserable married couple vocal about Don’s professional inadequacies. The film’s a provocative probe into one’s self-worth and esteem rounding midlife and trying to find truth within and within others close to them. (Sarah G. Vincent) Video on demand only. Celine Song’s debut marks a lavishly melancholic film. Childhood friends Nora (Seung Ah Moon) and Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim) are together constantly, tethered by the others’ orbital force. They lose touch when Nora emigrates with her family from South Korea but reunite as adults, now played by Greta Lee and Teo Yoo. A soulful, bone-aching story, the film serves as a reminder that life is determined by action and instinct. The script, also written by Song, showcases emotions that lie beneath the surface, capturing the idea of love being a reflection of youth. Is what we’re remembering the love of the person or the love of the feeling? These characters linger in the others’ minds, pillars of their youth and, in moments, projections of what could have been. What makes “Past Lives” such a feat of storytelling is the ability to make ordinary existences transformative. Song’s grace in the film is found through her empathic understanding of how even the briefest relationship can take up space in a person’s heart for decades. Read a full review from June 8. (Ally Johnson) On Amazon Prime Video. Director Alexander Payne (“Election,” “Nebraska”) and television series writer David Hemingson’s first collaboration – shot on location in Massachusetts and set in the 1970s – is an instant Christmas classic. Every winter break, the exclusive, fictional all-boys boarding school Barton Academy has young men who remain on campus. Curmudgeon ancient civilization teacher and alum Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), who has nothing but contempt for his privileged charges, supervises the “holdovers,” which includes rebellious, sullen junior Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, in a seamless onscreen debut). Thanks to the coaching of mourning mother and kitchen supervisor Mary Lamb (Da’Vine Joy Robinson), the only other adult staying on campus, and local faculty member Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), Hunham transforms into Tully’s most nurturing and fiercest advocate. This heartwarming and humorous tale of misfits connecting over wounded pasts and adoring the beauty and potential in each other is a lesson in unconditional acceptance and redemption without pity or mocking. By saving Tully from the Vietnam War, Hunham gives himself a second chance of living a full life. Read a full review from Nov. 11. (Sarah G. Vincent) In theaters and on Amazon Prime Video. Only Christopher Nolan could adapt Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s “American Prometheus,” a mammoth tome about American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and have audiences gobble it up like his more traditional summer popcorn films such as “Inception” (2010), the Dark Knight trilogy and “Tenet” (2020). The titular protagonist (Cillian Murphy, who carries the film dutifully) hits his zenith as the father of the atomic bomb during World War II; during the Red Scare of the 1950s, he falls from grace because of nonpolitical ties to communists. Besides the Trinity Test in the desert, much of the action becomes backroom betrayal and kangaroo court sparring, a conventional, contrasting character study between Oppenheimer and his former boss, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), that gets told in an unconventional way, alternating between charting Oppenheimer’s career, the 1958 Senate hearings on Strauss’ nomination to secretary of commerce and the 1954 U.S. Atomic Energy Commission deliberating whether to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Nolan eschews chronological order and toggles between color/subjective perspective and black and white/documentary-style, complemented by editor Jennifer Lame and composer Ludwig Göransson, and the film never gets bogged down despite the intermission-less, three-hour runtime – a record for Nolan. Bursting at the seams with an ensemble delivering memorable performances and impressive practical effects, “Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s best film to date and the definitive historical biopic about the era. Read a full review from July 19. (Sarah G. Vincent) In theaters and on Amazon Prime Video. The most recent from indie stalwart Kelly Reichardt (“First Cow”) reunites the director with early collaborator and recent Oscar nominee (for “The Fabelmans”) Michelle Williams (who starred in Reichardt’s “Wendy and Lucy” and “Meek’s Cutoff”). The focus is again the Pacific Northwest, where many of Reichardt’s films take place, but in the near contemporary rather than the frontier era of “Cow” and “Cutoff.” The shaggy-dog narrative is as much about family and familial dysfunction as about the art scene and its passive-aggressive competitiveness. Williams plays Lizzy, a sculptor who makes Degas-like statuettes of waifish young women. She can’t catch an art opening break and her landlord, also an artist (BU alum Hong Chau, so good in “The Menu” and Oscar-nominated for her caretaker part in “The Whale”), drags her feet in getting the hot water turned back on despite Lizzy not having had a shower in days. There’s also Lizzy’s dad, an established but eccentric artist (Judd Hirsch, also opposite Williams in “Fabelmans” and also Oscar nominated for it) who’s got a bunch of random hippies hanging out at his cottage studio. It’s a dour yet quirky meander that revolves around the well-being of a wounded pigeon. (Tom Meek) On Showtime.  There’s overwhelming compassion for the characters in Kelly Fremon Craig’s (“The Edge of Seventeen”) adaptation of the Judy Blume YA classic, and Craig’s take on the 1970s-set novel captures turbulent girlhood with detail and reverence. Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is 11 and going into sixth grade after having moved, reluctantly, to a new town. “Are You There God?” refreshes the genre by focusing on the minutiae of day-to-day life for preteen girls, whose naiveté has them longing to get their period, wear bras despite their discomfort and kiss boys they’re not even sure they like. Rachel McAdams as Margaret’s mother, Barbara, is luminous in a performance made for her easy charm and empathetic disposition. Shooting with compositional care for all the bits and pieces that make up these characters’ lives, Craig delivers an honest, hilarious and heartfelt film about a girl who is beginning to see the world with greater skepticism and curiosity. The result is something quietly profound, a film that understands that the world at 11 is impossibly endless. (Ally Johnson) On Starz and Amazon Prime Video. Todd Haynes’ loose adaptation of the real-life Mary Kay Letourneau case, about the Washington schoolteacher who had an affair with a 13-year old student in the 1990s and marries him after she gets out of prison, is a smorgasbord of deep character plumbs and rich performances. The film slowly and effectively backs into the premise as the fictional Mary Kay, Gracie (Julianne Moore), and her much younger husband, Joe (Charles Melton), are visited by a striking young woman by the name of Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman), a midlist actor renowned for a graphic nude scene or two who is down to do research for an upcoming telling of Gracie and Joe’s sordid union in a small, indie production. The character study veers as Elizabeth has coffee with Gracie’s ex-husband (D.W. Moffett) and later a music hall encounter with Gracie’s son Georgie (a sassy and beguiling Cory Michael Smith) from her first marriage. Elizabeth’s presence also stirs something in Gracie and Joe. They have a simmering inner turmoil fueled by the reliving of their ignominy and the upcoming graduation of their children that will leave the two alone – “to what future?” seems to be the lingering question. The performances by the three leads have raw reveals nailed with aplomb. Most intriguing is Portman’s actor: inviting at first, then unnerving as she begins to work the equation from both sides. It’s her most perverse and sensual performance since “Black Swan” (2010). It’s also nice to see Haynes (“Velvet Goldmine,” “I’m Not There”) back in the realm of dark quirk after the conventional “Dark Waters” and reuniting with his longtime muse, Moore, from “Safe” (1995), “Far From Heaven” (2002) and “Carol” (2015). (Tom Meek) On Netflix. Justine Triet’s film, winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes, dissects the slow, vicious implosion of a marriage. The reasons are the usual suspects: grief, blame and jealousy. But there’s little else usual about Triet’s emotionally eviscerating narrative, which begins with the death of one spouse and, in carefully curated frames, rewinds as the survivor is put on trial for murder. Sandra Hüller portrays a revered German writer living in the remote highs of the French Alps and then subjected to character dissection in the courtroom, and the performance is immersive, fully felt from within and the reason the film rivets from opening to closing frame. Between her work here and “Zone of Interest,” Hüller could see her name called twice when Oscar nominations are announced. Read a full review from Oct. 28.

Sakura Andō stars as a mother, Saori, who begins noticing strange behavior in her young son, Minato (Sōya Kurokawa) in the empathetic and haunting latest from Hirokazu Kore-eda (“Shoplifters,” “After the Storm”). The story is told from three points of view, including the mother, the boy’s teacher, Hori (Eita Nagayama), and the boy himself, revealing successively more about the truth behind Minato’s personal demons in a story about rebirth and the painful reality of a parent’s inability to ever truly understand their child. Written by Yûji Sakamoto, the film possesses an emotional subtlety that lies heavy against us as it progresses and we become more entangled and concerned in the lives of these characters – Minato in particular. Kurokawa’s performance is vital to the film’s success; our hearts ache for his desperate, quiet search for compassion and understanding from adults who can’t begin to understand the pressure he feels to hide himself from the world. Kore-eda’s elegance as a filmmaker is on display here, taking an observant approach to characters while capturing the overwhelming nature that surrounds them. The film brandishes acute beauty in devastation and understanding of human error, ending on a note of melancholy as we’re asked to question what constitutes a happy ending.

"Dec 29, 2023",positive," With the end of the year bringing ambitious new works from octogenarian masters Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, and Ridley Scott—plus strong new entries from mid-career auteurs Yorgos Lanthimos, Jonathan Glazer, Wes Anderson, and Alexander Payne—2023, in some ways, felt like a throwback to an era to which many (male, middle-aged) cinephiles have longed to return. But Barbie and Oppenheimer, the films whose mutually beneficial fake rivalry defined the year, were both real movies from real filmmakers with real points of view, and the commercial success of both felt like Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan getting away with something. That, plus the fact that audiences finally rejected a pair of truly forgettable Marvel movies (honestly, the much-reviled The Flash was better than either of them), was another sign that the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel might be something other than an oncoming train. Barbenheimer’s great success came at the expense of the supposedly penultimate entry in the best, most analog action franchise going. Given the chaotic process by which writer-director Christopher McQuarrie says he and stuntman/producer/star Tom Cruise make these movies, they should be train wrecks. Instead, this one gave us the most thrilling train wreck ever captured on digital celluloid. Move over, Buster Keaton!  Ari Aster’s inscrutable odyssey about a troubled man’s quest to leave his apartment and visit his mother was the better of the year’s two Joaquin Phoenix-starring epics by a mile. It was lovely to see Parker Posey again, but yikes. Remember when Tim Burton made films you actually wanted to see? Lanthimos’ reunion with his The Favourite collaborator Emma Stone was weird and kinky and hilarious and unsettling in the way Burton’s films once were—in a previous century. Let me see if I can do this from memory, about a film I saw three times: Anderson’s lockdown-inspired latest depicts a 1950s TV broadcast of a filmed stage production of a play about a one-horse New Mexico town that gets locked down by the U.S. Army following a Close Encounter? Whatever, this movie was bliss. It was great to see Jeffrey Wright, the standout player from The French Dispatch, solidify his standing among the Wes Anderson Players, a group that Tom Hanks slid into like a comfy old sweater. And seeing Jason Schwartzman—who also appeared as the year’s best supervillain in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse—play a middle-aged widower a quarter century after embodying Max Fischer in Anderson’s seminal Rushmore only made the reflections on mortality land harder. Sure, we could’ve used even more of the magnificent Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, one of the survivors of a murderous conspiracy against newly super-rich Osage people during the 1920s. But Scorsese deserves the credit he got for hitting pause on the version of his adaptation of David Grann’s nonfiction book that he was about to shoot when a group of Osage leaders contacted him to offer their insight into the project. Rebooting the movie away from the procedural version that would’ve starred Leonardo DiCaprio as straight-arrow lawman Tom White, and choosing instead to make Burkhart the focus and DiCaprio her shit-heel husband Ernest, required Scorsese to go find his $200 million budget elsewhere. The result was a more complex and empathetic film. Glazer’s follow-up to 2013’s Under the Skin reinvented the Holocaust film by keeping all the horror off-screen, puncturing any scar tissue you might’ve built up from previous treatments of the subject. A fascinating hybrid of suspense thriller, character study, and memory play, Nolan’s three-hour, CGI-free gabfest was his own Grand Budapest Hotel—meaning, the one even his most committed detractors had to acknowledge as significant. That this movie grossed $950 million worldwide suggests that maybe we can have nice things, at least sometimes. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Dec 29, 2023",positive," Many films about powder-keg men tend to be little more than a 90-minute lit fuse. John Trengove’s dark, claustrophobic, and very close-to-home Manodrome has the slow-churning tension we’ve come to expect from stories about loners getting ready to blow. But watching the downfall of Ralphie (Jesse Eisenberg), a scared and drifting bundle of neuroses and sallow discontent, feels like a larger societal indictment.  With Oppenheimer, possibly the most anticipated film of 2023, Christopher Nolan has hit a home run yet again but has done so by subverting our expectations, reinventing himself – and detonating the scale and scope of what we thought was possible in moviemaking. It is a drama about the creation of the atomic bomb that’s not much concerned with the bomb at all. It’s a character study of a man whose character remains impenetrable to this day. It is a relentless examination of ethical and moral decision-making in a situation where no outcome could possibly be ruled ethically or morally right. More than anything, Oppenheimer is a tale of selling global domination as utilitarian benevolence by (heaps of) men posing as “patriots” but essentially uninterested in anything except their own position in the new world order.  One of recent memory’s most impressive writing and directing debuts, Celine Song’s Past Lives creates heart-pounding drama out of the teensiest slivers of story. Decades after burgeoning playwright Nora (Greta Lee) emigrated from South Korea, she gets in touch with Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), the quiet boy she was once close friends with and possibly in love with. They have grown apart—she is now a wry, urbane, and married cynic while he is still single, with a stoic surface barely covering a roiling romanticism.  Errol Morris’ The Pigeon Tunnel follows a wily, cynical, yet chipper John le Carré down a rabbit hole of Cold War moral ambiguity. Like most of the men Morris films for his documentaries on the intersection of power, politics, warfare, and hubris (The Fog of War, The Unknown Known, American Dharma), the late David Cornwell (le Carré is his pen name) is a controlled and conniving presence working assiduously to present a particular image. Unlike those figures (Robert McNamara, Donald Rumsfeld, and Steve Bannon, respectively), who cast their kind of reality-bending forcefield, Cornwell is fully upfront about his machinations. “This is a performance art,” he says, leaving just enough uncertainty about whether he means just the interview with Morris, his writing, or his entire life.  Are women fated to be locked in an eternal struggle for freedom and control? Will women ever be free, even if technology controls nature? Who is in control of the technology?  It’s always been an identity fundament of many self-proclaimed eccentric auteurs not to do “normal”, except Yorgos Lanthimos actually doesn’t do normal. Poor Things, easily the Greek director’s best film to date, transcends his usual contained dialogues and sparse environments for a maximalist carnival of world-building and discovery from a woman just learning what it means to be alive. Based on the 1992 novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray and a screenplay by Tony Mcnamara, Poor Things details the life of Bella Baxter (a brilliant Emma Stone), a young Victorian woman resurrected by a deformed scientist Godwin Baxter (Willem Defoe just doing his thing), who takes her on as a “guardian”, keeping her enclosed on his estate.  In her early days, Bella, like a baby, learns to walk, speak, and socialize, but soon enough, she discovers sexuality and starts to yearn for emancipation. After a horny man pig of a lawyer, Duncan Wedderburn (a hilarious Marc Ruffalo), enters Bella’s little world, she runs off with him to “explore the world”. On the way, amid hyper-saturated, surrealist images of Lanthimos’ and Gray’s richly imaginative, bizarre world, Bella will transcend any notion of being Frankenstein’s monster, instead growing into a whip-smart and resourceful woman.  It’s almost unbelievable that the 82 palpitating, palm-sweating, borderline insane minutes of Reality are based on verbatim conversations between Reality Winner, a former US Intelligence employee, and a couple of FBI agents who’ve arrived to raid her home on suspicion she leaked classified documents – but they are. For better or worse, this incredulity that borders on the uncanny is why a conversation between a 27-year-old NSA translator and two sleuth hounds already made for stellar material for Tina Satter’s 2019 play, Is This a Room? (an actual line spoken by one of the agents).  This year’s film version, a crime docudrama co-written with James Paul Dallas and directed by Satter in her feature debut, is a visceral upgrade of the stage experience, and we have a phenomenal cast and assuredly claustrophobic direction to thank. Sydney Sweeney is unbearably efficient as Winner, cornered and mauled by agents Garrick and Taylor, who attempt to sweet-talk (!) her into confessing her involvement in the leak. As the smiling Garrick (a bone-chilling Josh Hamilton) “kindy coerces” Winner to move from the porch into an empty room of her own home for interrogation, the ludicrous sadism of evasion as a tactical weapon, hiding beneath the veneers of banality as commonplace benevolence, gets you in a chokehold and doesn’t let up.  The MCU is wheezing into its What Do We Do Without Robert Downey Jr.? phase. DC keeps trying to armageddon themselves into relevance through sheer volume and excess. Only one corner of the over-crowded comic book cinemaverse is worth paying attention to now. That is the Miles Morales series. It started with 2018’s smashingly fun Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and continues with this hyperactive, winningly sweet, and gorgeously drawn animated adventure.  Zar Amir Ebrahimi and Guy Nattiv’s Tatami is a quietly impressive film. With time, it might well be considered a masterpiece. Tatami’s monochrome cinematography perhaps unconsciously builds on the political conflicts within the story, between the coercion of the Islamic Republic and Leila’s (Arienne Mandi) resistance to feign an injury at the Judo World Championships. Tatami is a political film, but it’s also a story about the conflict and unimaginable choice between the love of one’s family and one’s values. Its suspense derives from the film’s engagement with the audience. We feel the weight of pressure on Leila and anger towards the agents of the Islamic Republic who lurk, issuing her with threatening ultimatums. We fear for the safety of Leila’s husband and daughter, and we feel anger towards her parents, who also tried to coerce her. Indeed, Tatami stirs the audience’s emotions to fuel the suspense. “I’ll go to war for you. Against anyone. Do you understand that?” roars Inez at her six-year-old son Terry into a payphone in Brooklyn. A convicted thief, too young to be a mother, she’s a Black woman who wants her son out of foster care and back with her. When Terry accuses her of abandonment, she promises not to leave him again – the first step being abducting him from a hospital and running off to Harlem. So begins A Thousand and One, a firecracker debut by writer-director Alina Victoria Rockwell and a showcase for star Teyana Taylor’s rich talent. One part family drama but a 101-part gut-wrenching tale of the appalling reality of Black women and men surviving on the streets, this understated, tactful film reaches incredible heights through the thoughtful subtlety of the script and the loud fearlessness of Taylor’s performance.  Over more than a decade (1994-2005), we watch Inez fight with all she’s got to build a functional home for her kind and gifted son amid incessant gentrification, institutional racism, and problematic personal relationships; despite her crime, we start rooting for her. ”Nobody gives a shit about black women except black women, and even that shit get messy!,” Inez screams at one point, winning over sympathy not by victimizing herself but for persevering despite a dire pole position and endless hurdles. As inspiring as it is to watch Taylor soar as a “me against the world” hustler, the real marvel here is Rockwell, who commands every word and frame with maturity and poise seldom seen in young auteurs.  Jonathan Glazer’s adaptation of Martin Amis’ novel, The Zone of Interest, is the year’s most unsettling film. Focusing on the commandant of Auschwitz and his wife’s idyllic life in the house and garden next door to the concentration camp, we only hear the sounds of cries and machinery and see smoke rise from the chimneys. Refusing to look upon the horror conveys the Nazi indifference towards the Jews and emphasises the inhumane cruelty that permitted the genocidal atrocities. Watching the mundane rituals, the family’s comfort and security, while on the other side of a wall, human beings are deprived of life and dignity, is a provocative statement. What’s striking is how The Zone of Interest utilises the power of the spoken word to express the disturbing events that it refuses to gaze upon. The rudimentary and practical conversation about the efficiency of the incinerators, for example, contextualises the passive acceptance of industrialised slaughter as, pardon the choice of phrase, “business as usual”."
"Dec 27, 2023",positive, It's finally time to talk Oppenheimer here on the MAM main feed. Thanks to our VIPs for digging into the episode last week. Did Christopher Nolan deliver the goods with this one? Let's discuss!
"Dec 26, 2023",positive," Oppenheimer, dirigida por Christopher Nolan, muestra su intención desde las primeras escenas. La de contar dos historias a la vez, a través de líneas temporales distintas que corren en paralelo. Por un lado, la versión de Julius Robert Oppenheimer​ (Cillian Murphy) sobre el papel que le tocó protagonizar en un momento crítico. Al otro, un hecho histórico total y en cierta medida violento, que cambió para siempre, el equilibrio de poder en el mundo y la forma de entender la capacidad destructiva humana.  Pero la cinta, no es, ni una biografía, ni tampoco, esencialmente, un drama histórico. El argumento se mueve los dos géneros y mantiene un delicado equilibrio a partir de dos visiones de la verdad. ¿Qué llevó a Oppenheimer a enfocar toda su determinación en crear un arma que, sabía, sería una fractura siniestra para la época? ¿Qué hizo necesario la fabricación de la bomba atómica en un período en el que el fantasma de la guerra era más real y amenazante que nunca?  Christopher Nolan no intenta explorar en lo moral, mucho menos, en la percepción acerca de un dilema ético en puertas. Lo que desea es algo más audaz y lo logra a través de un argumento denso y angustioso. Dejar claro que tanto Oppenheimer como Estados Unidos no hicieron otra cosa que aceptar un destino inevitable. El de avanzar contra reloj y vencer el mal contemporáneo que se gestaba en Europa bajo la sombra de los nazis.  Oppenheimer, de Christopher Nolan, es un acercamiento meticuloso y oscuro a una parte controvertida de la historia norteamericana. A través de la figura del científico, el director se adentra en cuestionamientos directos - y casi políticos - acerca de la carrera armamentista, la paz y la guerra. Lo que permite al argumento mostrar una dura época en que el mal menor era la única opción entre posibilidades, catastróficas. Pero la cinta, es también un logro técnico de considerable envergadura. No solo por el uso de un punto de vista subjetivo y otro objetivo, separados a través de uso del color. También, por la forma en que el guion y la edición, crean una atmósfera tenebrosa para avanzar hacia una tragedia. Puede parecer una justificación acerca a la carrera armamentista en plena Segunda Guerra Mundial. Pero el relato evita caer en posiciones maniqueas y muestra dos extremos de los sucesos que cuenta. Oppenheimer es un hombre convencido que la bomba atómica es una necesidad. En el mejor de los casos, una batalla a ciegas por evitar que un enemigo despiadado logre primero un triunfo científico de crucial importancia.  Christopher Nolan muestra al personaje desde sus contradicciones y lo humaniza, gracias a una tensión interior que se vuelve más tenebrosa a medida que avanza la narración. Gradualmente, el científico titular comprende las múltiples consecuencias de sus decisiones. El hecho que está creando una posibilidad del futuro cuyos alcances son, en esencia y de manera forzosa, desastrosos.  Pero para el físico teórico, no hay escapatoria. En el mejor de los casos, sabe que la decisión es por un mal menor. El guion, también escrito por el realizador, tiene la suficiente habilidad al explorar en la oscuridad del personaje sin juicios. Desde sus primeras apariciones, Oppenheimer es un hombre empecinado en lograr una forma de justicia. En detener una guerra, en tomar decisiones que nadie más podría.  La trama lo convierte en una figura por momentos despiadada y en otras, abrumada por el peso insospechado de un protagonismo histórico que nunca pidió. Mucho menos, que sabe cómo entender, sustentar o elevar más allá del esfuerzo cada vez más desesperado por cumplir su deber. ¿Cuál es ese? La de evitar que una arma de potencia para una hecatombe esté en manos nazis.  No obstante, bajo esa obsesión, subyace la osadía, la necesidad de improvisar, de comprobar las teorías largamente meditadas. Según el guion, Oppenheimer precisa encontrar un sentido a un esfuerzo intelectual que se compagina con sentimientos viscerales.  La película no hace sencilla la percepción de su personaje principal y en ocasiones, enfatiza su cualidad temeraria. Pero a la vez, la angustia existencial de saber que lo que lleva a cabo, le empujará, pronto o más tarde, a un horror inevitable. Una y otra vez, el relato deja entrever qué tan consciente estuvo el científico que su obra solo era el comienzo de una tragedia histórica. También, el escaso margen de maniobra que tuvo para evitarlo.  La trama utiliza algunas trampas sutiles en un intento de ocultar su narración a dos tiempos. La más inteligente y bien planteada, las tomas en blanco y negro que muestran la realidad detrás de la vida de Oppenheimer. Poco a poco, el relato se completa a sí mismo al mostrar el mundo que el científico tuvo que enfrentar. A la vez, los duros procesos interiores que le empujaron hacia contradicciones cada vez más evidentes en su criterio. El montaje pone a ambas situaciones en paralelo, aunque es obvio que ocurren antes o después de la línea central de los eventos.  Pero el director se asegura que el relato y la edición, no den señales precisas de cuando ocurre cada suceso. De modo que la película parece encontrarse en un presente sutil y atemporal en que todo ocurre a la vez. La única señal notoria de hacia dónde transita la historia, es, por supuesto, el estallido de la bomba atómica. El temible e inquietante momento, en todos los esfuerzos, temores, esperanzas y ambiciones, se transforman en fuego puro. No se trata de una metáfora. Christopher Nolan encamina todos sus esfuerzos a recorrer cada detalle que conformó el proyecto Manhattan y la prueba Trinity. Lo que incluye, largos debates sobre ética, el peligro en puertas y la codicia de una época en que el riesgo atómico no era comparable al del enemigo con mejor armamento. El director y guionista es competente y formalmente sobrio, al contar meticulosamente una serie de sucesos, pero no en orden lineal. De manera que la cinta va desde Los Alamos, a una audiencia en el Congreso estadounidense hasta los diversos lugares en que las mentes más extraordinarias del mundo fueron reclutadas.  Es entonces, cuando el largometraje hace gala de su espléndido elenco. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), se convierte en un hilo conductor de sucesos y situaciones. Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), tiene la firmeza necesaria de interpelar a su esposo, aunque el guion desaprovecha algunos de los mejores debates entre ambos. En especial, cuando deben asumir la carga de la responsabilidad que les incluye en una posibilidad aterradora. La de ser los artífices de un posible final de la historia humana.  A través de la pareja, Oppenheimer plantea la idea que el logro del científico fue más una combinación de conocimientos y talentos. Que, a la vez, incluyó todo un contexto que le empujó a dar respuestas inmediatas a un dilema de la época. El guion explora en Norteamérica, convertida en el responsable de la paz mundial. También, en el único país — y sistema — capaz de encarar primero a los nazis y después, la posibilidad del poderío soviético.  Algo parecido ocurre con el resto de los personajes. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) tiene el peculiar peso de una voz de la conciencia para Oppenheimer, aunque el personaje —y la interpretación de la actriz— parece sub utilizados. Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) formula las preguntas necesarias y las incómodas, aunque la mayoría no tienen respuestas. Al otro lado, el Ernest Lawrence (Josh Harnett) es la encarnación de un país que desea vencer. Que sueña con la percepción del triunfo científico como moneda de cambio por la estabilidad global.  Incluso, la aproximación a Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) es brillante en su sentido sobre la consecuencia política que sustituye la moral. Cuando finalmente se imputa y se señala a Oppenheimer por el invento que trajo la muerte y la victoria, no se realiza a partir del juicio ético. Al menos, Strauss no lo hace. Christopher Nolan usa a la figura para explorar en EE. UU. como escenario de una guerra frontal contra cualquier oposición. La arrogancia del poderío militar convertido en temor y amenaza subyacente.  La película se sostiene bien entre múltiples escenarios, conversaciones y datos. Pero su gran objetivo, por supuesto, es mostrar la hecatombe atómica en todo su poderío, belleza terrorífica y detalle. La tan anunciada explosión es un logro técnico y visual que deslumbra y es, de hecho, lo que probablemente definirá a la película en el futuro. Es la conclusión de ambas líneas históricas y aunque tarda en llegar, sostiene todo lo planteado con anterioridad. De hecho, Oppenheimer analiza la finalidad del horror desde lo utilitario. La explosión de la bomba se describe con detalle y casi a través de los códigos del cine de terror. Es el miedo, de todos los personajes, de una nación entera, del mundo de la época, construido y sostenido en una llamarada que Christopher Nolan muestra casi mítica. Lenguas de fuego que avasallan cualquier debate y que profundizan en los puntos filosóficos planteados hasta entonces. La muerte es inevitable para la paz. La amenaza, para el equilibrio. El mensaje más escalofriante que la película deja a su paso. "
"Dec 26, 2023",positive," Imaginemos
que se ha anunciado con meses de anticipación un gran evento, una gran fiesta.
La fiesta promete ser de las mejores del año. Las entradas se venden agotando
funciones como si se tratara de conciertos de Coldplay o Taylor Swift en
Argentina, donde nadie entiende de dónde sale ese dinero en un país en crisis.
Al entrar a la fiesta, observamos y detectamos dos sectores VIP con ambientes
totalmente distintos. A la derecha, un grupo de hombres y mujeres elegantes de
traje y vestidos largos toman whisky, alguna que otra cerveza; todo parece muy
clásico y hasta un poco pretencioso. A la izquierda, una explosión de colores y
risas. Los daiquiris de frutilla van y vienen mientras los invitados bailan
como adolescentes mientras del otro lado de la habitación el primer grupo
dialoga sobre la complejidad del espacio-tiempo y el destino humano. A la
derecha, el grupo está encabezado por Chirstopher Nolan, quien tiene a su lado
a un Cillian Murphy que apenas se ha quitado su boina de los Peaky Blinders. A
la izquierda, está Greta Gerwig acompañada por una esplendorosa Margot Robbie
vestida de rosa. Los grupos
son las películas dirigidas por sus referentes; Oppenheimer de Nolan, y Barbie
de Gerwig. ¿La ubicación de la fiesta? Una sala de cine. Y la incógnita acerca
de dónde ha salido tanto dinero para comprar entradas en plena crisis económica
hace referencia a otra pregunta: ¿de dónde surgió tanto interés por parte del
público por ir al cine cuando lo único que las cifras demuestran es el
menguante interés por asistir a las salas de cine? La fiesta se llama Barbieheimer
y ha sido el evento cinematográfico mejor promocionado del año. Nosotros
nos acercamos a la barra y pedimos una bebida para estar a tono, respiramos
hondo y nos adentramos en el laberinto filosófico que se presenta al entrar en
la filmografía del director de películas como Memento, la trilogía de Batman:
The Dark Night, The Prestige, Inception o Dunkirk. Hoy, hablamos de
la última película del director inglés: Oppenheimer. Adaptada
del libro publicado en 2005 y escrito por Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin Prometeo
Americano: El triunfo y la tragedia de J. Robert Oppenheimer, la última
película de Nolan funciona, al menos en un inicio, como una especie de película
biográfica sobre el físico teórico estadounidense J. Robert Oppenheimer, quien
estuvo al mando del Proyecto Manhattan. En él, un numeroso grupo de científicos
—bajo lineamiento, control, gestión y financiación militar— terminaría por
concebir y posteriormente detonar la primera bomba atómica en lo que se conoció
como la prueba Trinity, que desembocaría en las dos bombas que Estados Unidos
lanzaría sobre Hiroshima y Nagasaki en agosto de 1945, que acabaron con la vida
de más de 200.000 japoneses. A gran
escala, ese es el hilo conductor de la película, pero Nolan, basándose en el
libro de Bird y Sherwin, va más allá: hace uso de su vasta experiencia en los
relatos no lineales y su control desahogado sobre el montaje y propone lo que
termina por convertirse en una segunda película dentro de Oppenheimer.
Porque Oppenheimer es tanto una biopic como es un thriller
judicial. En el
relato, esto se construye en películas paralelas. Por un lado, la parte más atractiva,
entretenida, digerible, en la que Nolan hace que sus declaraciones sobre no
haber utilizado ningún efecto visual generado de manera digital (CGI) se luzcan
con grandilocuencia. Se cuentan los inicios de Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) como
científico y el proceso de creación de la bomba nuclear, siempre desde su
punto de vista. En paralelo, esto se articula con esta segunda película, el thriller
judicial, que Nolan presenta en blanco y negro. Allí toma principalmente el
punto de vista del personaje de Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), empresario y
funcionario público que presidiría la Comisión de Energía Atómica de Estados
Unidos y que a lo largo de los años distanciaría cada vez más su ideología de
la de Oppenheimer, algo que Nolan construye a través del uso del punto de vista
de manera inteligente para hacer que estos hechos resulten cinematográficos y
no simplemente anecdóticos. Es en este
juego de construir un relato doble que amalgame los sucesos de las diferentes
temporalidades que la película puede llegar a perderse (y al espectador) por el
simple uso de su forma, puesta por encima del contenido. En toda la tendencia
de Nolan hay cierto interés por parte del autor por recurrir a diálogos
exhaustivos y temáticas complejas que pueden, en el mejor de los casos,
desafiar el intelecto o capacidad de comprensión y concentración del espectador,
y, en el peor, volverse conceptualmente vacíos. Y en este caso, Nolan se
arriesga al cuadrado. No es fácil para el espectador promedio seguir los
razonamientos y diálogos de físicos, matemáticos, químicos, ingenieros, etc.
Pero tampoco es completamente accesible toda la jerga judicial y política que
se utiliza en las secuencias de blanco y negro en relación al juicio/audiencia
que se le imparte a Oppenheimer. Sin
embargo, a pesar de estos tropezones, Nolan busca, a fin de cuentas, sembrarnos
la duda acerca de los grises que caracterizan a su protagonista (y al verdadero
Oppenheimer). Nos lleva a lugares incómodos, tematizando los conceptos del bien
y del mal y dejando latente la idea de que Oppenheimer fue despojado de su
humanidad por esa obsesión con la que generalmente se construye tanto
arquetípicamente como estereotípicamente a los científicos en este tipo de
narrativas. Para lograrlo, Nolan propone secuencias que repite en reiteradas
ocasiones donde de manera sensorial, a través de todos los recursos
audiovisuales posibles, nos adentra en la mente de Oppenheimer. Esto genera una
sensación de que no estamos simplemente expectantes al borde de una explosión
atómica generada por la bomba; también hay una cuenta regresiva dentro de su
creador que hace temblar la sala. Nolan es
capaz de transmitir esta idea acerca de lo sensorial a través de todas sus
decisiones y en conjunto con grandes colaboradores: el uso de efectos prácticos
y no visuales que se sienten reales y amenazantes (algo extremadamente valioso
en una época donde el CGI se ha vuelto cada vez más lamentable), la música
original de Ludwig Göransson, que acompaña al montaje a veces confuso y otras
completamente funcional de Jennifer Lame, y el broche de oro de la fotografía de
Hoyte van Hoytema (quien se merece un premio, no solo por su trabajo en la
película, sino porque no debe ser fácil lidiar con los caprichos y demandas de
Nolan a nivel visual). Esta hace que Oppenheimer sea, a diferencia de
muchas películas estrenadas últimamente, una experiencia para disfrutar (o
padecer, dependiendo de los gustos) en una sala de cine. Y logra que, a pesar
de tratarse de una película de tres horas que nos desafía en más de un sentido,
valga la pena. Pero a
pesar de todo esto, Oppemheimer lucha por momentos contra su propio
discurso. Hay cuestiones no resueltas a nivel de guion acerca de la idea de
Oppenheimer como mártir. Esto es algo que se plantea y de lo que es muy difícil
alejarse por la forma en la que la película es contada y por cómo conocemos su
intimidad, sus momentos de crisis, sus batallas, no solo contra sí mismo, sino
contra un Estados Unidos que lo persigue por tener conexiones con el Partido Comunista
a pesar de no ser miembro de este directamente, o su lugar de mando medio en
algo que era mucho más grande que él y sobre lo que su control era transitorio
y relativo. Pero esta
idea de mártir choca directamente contra otros pasajes de la película a nivel
de guion. Se afirma y reafirma posteriormente que Oppenheimer participó de las
decisiones que llevaron a que sus armas fueran utilizadas, y no fuera simplemente
una posibilidad. Esto, más que sembrar la duda, hace que sea muy difícil
empatizar con este personaje, que gran parte de la película se busca
victimizar, a pesar de haber, aún en vida, expresado su trauma y
arrepentimiento luego de su creación. Oppenheimer
es una explosión a nivel de experiencia cinematográfica, a pesar de que
irónicamente puede por momentos implosionar en contra de sí misma,
principalmente a causa de ciertas secuencias de guion que terminan por quitarle
peso a uno de los eventos más esperados del año. Más aún, a una de las
secuencias cinematográficas más esperadas del año (la explosión de la bomba
realizada con efectos prácticos en su totalidad), que pasa, al menos en un
primer visionado o sin previo aviso, prácticamente desapercibida. Lo que sí
no pasa para nada desapercibido, y es digno de mención porque habla mucho sobre
el prestigio y lo importante que puede resultar Nolan para la industria, es la
cantidad de actores y actrices de primer nivel que participan de la película. Si
bien la película, desde el lado actoral, es cargada por Murphy y Downey Jr.,
cuenta con un apoyo y espaldarazo constante de talentos como Emily Blunt,
Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Ben Safdie y Jason Clarke. Y como si esto fuera
poco, muchos otros actores impresionantes se limitan a hacer apariciones de
únicamente una o dos escenas, y no llegan quizás al minuto en pantalla (Tom
Conti, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, etc.). Esto
deja en claro que Oppenheimer es un proyecto de un calibre de producción
que —más que cameos innecesarios— cuenta con el apoyo de referentes de la
industria que confían no solo en los dólares de su director, sino también en el
resultado final de su trabajo, y quieren ser invitados en la fiesta más
esperada del año. Esto es para poder mejorar el intercambio entre los usuarios y que sea un lugar que respete las normas de convivencia.

"Dec 22, 2023",positive," If you add the first title on this list to the last one, you get the biggest moviegoing event of the year. It feels fitting to bookend 2023’s ranking with Barbenheimer, a moment of sheer, unadulterated enthusiasm for movies that drove box office numbers through the roof, because when I think back on the year in film, I still feel giddy. It was a terrific year at the movies. Heavyweights such as Ari Aster, Greta Gerwig, Christopher Nolan, and Martin Scorsese delivered career-defining works, while newcomers Chloe Domont, Molly Manning Walker, and Celine Song surprised us with films we couldn’t stop talking about. Coming up with 10 movies I was eager to endorse was easy. And I haven’t even seen Poor Things yet. But 2023 wasn’t all rainbows and bright-yellow rollerblades. In May, the Writers Guild of America went on strike, with screenwriters demanding higher wages and job security to keep up with the nebulous streaming landscape. In July, SAG-AFTRA followed suit. The strikes kept Hollywood quiet for several months, pushing projects such as Dune: Part Two into next year. Much more importantly, they underscored the industry’s dire need for change.  Then a few trying months later, it got some. The WGA reached what they called an “exceptional” deal in September, while SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract with bonuses and protections in November. Hollywood is still recovering from the pause in work, and it’s still an imperfect industry for working writers and actors. But it’s a step in the right direction. We gave it a viral marketing campaign free of charge, we went to movie theaters in droves to watch it, we debated about whether it was a groundbreaking work of feminism (it’s not) or merely a two-hour advertisement for a toy company (Mattel made it so, yeah). Gerwig’s Barbie became so central to the zeitgeist this year that it’s easy to lose sight of how deeply bizarre the whole thing is. Of course, Barbie is a brand extension exercise, but it’s an audacious, hilarious, and artistically crafted one, raising the bar considerably for big-budget intellectual property ventures to come. What makes a good life? That’s the question at the center of Chronicles of a Wandering Saint, a small, special film by newcomer Tomás Gómez Bustillo that played this year’s Latin American Film Festival. Rita (Mónica Villa) is an elderly custodian obsessed with becoming the most pious resident of her rural Argentine town. With a needle drop you’ll want to write home about, Chronicles takes a magical realist turn that forces Rita to realize that getting what you prayed for isn’t all it’s made out to be. Ostensibly Aster’s departure from horror, Beau Is Afraid might be the director’s scariest film yet. A sprawling, uncanny, three-hour fever dream, the movie is an odyssey through the psyche of Beau (Joaquin Phoenix), a middle-aged Jewish guy with a pocket full of mommy and daddy issues. Beau Is Afraid takes a lot of big swings and comes up with more than a few misses, but it also hits a few home runs, offering brilliant, farcical depictions of a mind tortured by anxiety. Judy Blume had declined numerous offers to option her beloved book Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret over the years, knowing that her 1970 novel, which follows an insightful 11-year-old through her puberty growing pains, had become a sacred text to girls everywhere. She finally handed the rights over to Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen), and the resulting adaptation is a tender window into girlhood and family that slightly expands the scope of its source text without sacrificing any of its wisdom. Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have once again teamed up to make a movie about greedy, evil men, but this is no Wolf of Wall Street. Killers of the Flower Moon tells the true story of the systematic murdering of Osage Nation members in 1920s Oklahoma, carried out by White men who were after Osage oil money. DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are superbly monstrous, while Lily Gladstone is remarkably enigmatic as Mollie Kyle. Well over three hours long, Killers doesn’t exactly go down easy, but rises to the brutal occasion at hand, resulting in one of the greatest cinematic feats of the year. At the center of May December is the terrible tabloid affair between Gracie (Julianne Moore) and Joe (Charles Melton), whose relationship began when Joe was in the seventh grade and Gracie was 24 years his senior. Usually, most of us wouldn’t spend more than one People magazine article with such a story, but director Todd Haynes brings us intimately close to the controversial couple through the eyes of Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who is shadowing the lispy Gracie for an upcoming movie. May December is a disturbing portrait of abuse, and a campy parody of performance. When Samuel falls to his death from the balcony of his Alpine chalet, all eyes are on his wife, a successful, unapologetic writer named Sandra (an excellent Sandra Hüller). Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or winning Anatomy of a Fall begins as a gripping courtroom drama about whether Sandra murdered her husband then transforms into a forensic analysis of a marriage between two flawed people, raising rich questions about gender, partnership, and love. Brands had quite the spring at the movies. March saw the release of Flamin’ Hot and Tetris, two films depicting the inception of their title products. Air, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s ode to the minds behind Nike’s Air Jordan shoe, arrived in April. By the time Matt Johnson’s BlackBerry rolled around in May, the world seemed ready to move on from the corporate origin story, and with good reason. But it’s a shame that BlackBerry emerged in the shadow of those movies, because it couldn’t be further from the Airs and Flamin’ Hots of the world. Instead of worshiping at the altar of its title brand, BlackBerry scrutinizes the people and the system that created it, making it more akin to David Fincher’s The Social Network. Jay Baruchel is wonderful as BlackBerry creator Mike Lazaridis, but it’s Glenn Howerton who steals the show as co-CEO Jim Balsillie, giving a hysterical, hot-tempered performance that could slot right into an episode of Succession. Movies do a lot of things. They entertain, they educate, they make audiences laugh and cry and jump out of their upholstered reclining seats. And on special occasions, they linger, imparting an image, feeling, or idea that leaves their viewer a bit different than they were before. Past Lives is a special occasion. Celine Song’s stirring debut feature revolves around a few key moments in the lives of a New York-based writer (Greta Lee), the childhood sweetheart she left in Korea (Teo Yoo), and her loving present-day husband (John Magaro). The film’s beating heart is the Korean concept of in-yun, which suggests that people gravitate to each other because they overlapped in a previous lifetime. Though small in scope, Past Lives is emotionally enormous, unearthing a bittersweet truth about the lives we lead with the people we love—and lives, and people, we never get to. The morning of Barbenheimer, a holiday I had anticipated like it was Christmas, a series of logistical misfortunes fit for a sitcom caused my friend and me to arrive late to the theater. By the time we tiptoed our way into our seats for Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project was already underway. Despite our 27-minute fumble, Oppenheimer delivered one of the most exhilarating and harrowing movie theater experiences I’ve ever had, painting a larger-than-life portrait of power—both nuclear and political—petulance, and penitence.  Days later, I returned to the theater to see it in its entirety, and that riveting first watch shriveled in comparison. Though I wouldn’t exactly recommend it, accidentally watching Oppenheimer like it was Nolan’s 2000 time-bending thriller Memento made the director’s gift for storytelling plain as day. Nolan’s career-long interest in timeline manipulation has been the subject of praise and the punchline of jokes; here, it’s the making of a masterpiece, elevating what in lesser hands could have been a conventional historical drama into an urgent, unforgettable work. With great artistry and relentless precision, Oppenheimer tells the story of the man who created the nuclear bomb, and was haunted by the fallout for the rest of his life. Pay attention, and you’ll be haunted too. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read. If you think that it's important to have high quality local reporting we hope you'll support our work with a monthly contribution."
"Dec 15, 2023",negative," Christopher Nolan’s much-touted, three hour bio pic Oppenheimer presents itself as a serious look at the complex moral depth of a brilliant man. But really it’s just a standard Hollywood hagiography, which uses standard-issue Hollywood emotional and intellectual shortcuts to enlist the audience in patriotic horseshit. From his cowardly refusal to give a single Japanese victim a speaking role, to his manipulative use of black and white to give sentimental nonsense a patina of authenticity, Nolan wallows in lazy, glib filmmaking, designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow, righteous glow of self-congratulation. Critics who have embraced this nonsense should be ashamed of themselves. The unwieldy, endless three-hour movie is more or less framed around Oppenheimer’s 1954 security hearing, in which he was stripped of security clearance and disgraced because of his past Communist ties and because of his discomfort with developing the H-bomb. Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) tells his life story to the committee, as Nolan cuts away to portray that life via epic blaring soundtrack and interpolation of dramatic incendiary graphics, illustrating the atomic whoosh and boom inside Oppenheimer’s head. More pedestrianly, the movie follows Oppenheimer as a young man studying the new physics in Europe, emphasizing his brilliance, his idiosyncrasy, his passion for justice which leads him into Communist circles, his philandering, his ambition, and his hatred of the Nazis. All of this culminates in his leadership of the Manhattan Project and the successful development of the atomic bomb, which is dropped on Japan rather than Germany, sparking in Oppenheimer ambivalent Doubts. Again, the movie makes a pretense of sharing or exploring those doubts. But the truth is Nolan couldn’t care less about the question of whether it was a good idea to drop not one, but two atomic bombs and kill hundreds of thousands of non combatants, including children. And you can tell he doesn’t care because he raises these issues most insistently in the context of that security clearance hearing, which he presents as the most immoral thing in the film—far more immoral than murdering civilians. The hearing is, we’re told, payback from bureaucrat Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who Oppenheimer once embarrassed in a public hearing. Strauss decides to destroy Oppenheimer’s career as payback, leaking his security file to a rabid anti-Communist with ties to J. Edgar Hoover. The hearing is presented as a farce, and Strauss eventually ends up ranting like a super-villain, his manipulations condemned even by his own supine staff. The actual ethics of Oppenheimer’s complicity in the bomb is gently nuked by the familiar mechanics of melodrama; Oppenheimer becomes the good guy by virtue of being persecuted by the bad guy. The corpses the good guy is responsible for are relegated to hallucinatory dream where their moral weight is secondary to their role as symbolic demonstrations of the intricacies of his character. The film uses the anti Communist witch hunts to duck the ethics of nuclear annihilation. But it doesn’t really deal with the ethics of the witch hunts either. We’re told over and over that Oppenheimer was never a real Communist, which allows the movie to mostly avoid taking sides on whether persecuting actual Communists was justified or not. The most prominent party member in the film, Oppenheimer’s lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is carefully delegitimized; she’s presented as mentally unstable in no small part through persistent hypersexualization. Much of the discussion of Tatlock has centered on whether portraying sex and nudity in film is ever justified, which has neatly elided what the sex and nudity in this film is doing. Oppenheimer has a number of lovers, but Tatlock is the only one shown topless or having sex with him at all, and she’s practically more nude in the movie than not. Nudity in this film isn’t equated with pleasure, sensuality, or self-exploration (as in, for example, Don’t Worry, Darling.) Instead, it’s linked to exposure and humiliation. In the scene where he discusses his relationship with Tatlock before the committee, Oppenheimer himself is nude, and we see him and Jean having sex before the censorious security inspectors, in a half dream sequence that’s meant to cast the judges as voyeurs and Oppenheimer as helpless.  Oppenheimer’s nudity is weakness; by extension, so is Jean’s, in this scene and in others. The nudity and sex are necessary because the nudity and sex are the primary way through which the film characterizes Tatlock as unstable and pitiful. Her Communist beliefs are less important than the bare skin that strips them of meaning. Since sex is who Tatlock is, you don’t need to think too much about whether her ideas influenced Oppenheimer. Ultimately, Oppenheimer’s most important relationship in the film isn’t with Tatlock, or Strauss, or his wife, but with Einstein (Tom Conti). Einstein only has a walk on part, but the short encounters between the two men are thematically central. That’s especially the case for a discussion after the bomb has been dropped which is revisited multiple times, once at the very end of the film. The exchange takes place outside; standing beside a scenic pond, Einstein, white-haired wise man and God surrogate, gives Oppenheimer his blessing, assuring him that his legacy is important and that the guilt he bears is a kind of sanctification. Oppenheimer reiterates his loyalty to the United States and then, in an ectomorphic, beatific close up, utters some sententious lines about how he set off a chain reaction which destroyed the world. And what is that moral? It gently evaporates in a gush of deference and awe—at the hugeness of the bomb, and the hugeness of Hollywood. Oppenheimer, like Nolan, is the director of vast human resources in pursuit of a massive payload. The actual meaning, or use, of the mechanism is less important than its power—a power which justifies both the creator and the nation-state in whose name the power is deployed. As Viet Thanh Nguyen has argued, the “Hollywood industrial complex…is crucial to the military industrial complex”; America’s military superiority is justified and advanced by its massively disproportionate control of representation, ideology, memory, and history. It’s in that context that Nolan tells us that Oppenheimer is a good American and a good man not despite the deaths on his conscience, but precisely because those deaths make him complicated and cool. Vacuous hagiography is indistinguishable from vacuous nationalism is indistinguishable from the romanticization of overwhelming force, in the form of a huge honking explosion and/or the huge honking movie that blandly justifies it. Thanks, Noah. Your review is the best one I have read. As one who has worked in nuclear and especially in the endless clean-up of the nuclear weapons complex, I too had very mixed reactions to this film. I have visited and worked in many of these facilities. Your words helped me solidify my basic feeling that this is a terrible movie. Thanks. Great review."
"Dec 9, 2023",positive," Is the franchise era over? In 2023, a slew of superhero movies earned hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office each and still reportedly failed to make back the money required to produce and market them. Not even Tom Cruise, 2022’s box office savior, could rescue a Mission: Impossible movie from the installment fatigue that has set in across multiplexes — a kind of invasive exhaustion that’s made even the most reliable (or put another way, formulaic) of animated features falter in theaters. All this uncertainty raises a natural question: If franchises are dead, what’s next? As our critics thumbed through the many, many movie releases of 2023 to determine their favorites from the past year, that question loomed. Are there hints for what’s to come, post-Barbenheimer, in the kinds of films that broke through for them when a Paul Rudd–led Marvel title couldn’t? Greta Gerwig’s and Christopher Nolan’s historic releases perhaps provide some clues, though only one of them made our critics’ top-10 lists. In the end, after sifting through the tumult, Bilge Ebiri and Alison Willmore landed on 10 very different films each — not one movie choice made the other’s list. Still, there are similarities: Filmmakers with a penchant for autobiography made both records, movies that clock the existential confusion of being locked inside a career did too. And in a year when it feels safer than ever to say superhero movies are throttling toward their own demise, one of them ended up in our top 20. Perhaps the best answer to what comes next is, simply, more chaos. Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or–winning courtroom drama, about a woman accused of killing her husband after he falls to his death in suspicious fashion, would be gripping enough as a procedural. But it gains transcendence as it begins to question the very nature of truth. Reality, we understand, is something different for each individual, an idea that has particular power in the world today. Anatomy of a Fall, however, isn’t necessarily a Grand Statement About Our Times; Triet and her co-writer and partner, Arthur Harari, have surely imagined this more as an exploration of domestic conflict than anything else. But their observational acuity, their fidelity to life as it’s lived — along with Sandra Huller’s entrancing lead performance — results in something that keeps exploding in the mind long after the credits have rolled. It should have been evident long ago that Wes Anderson’s brand of hyper-controlled whimsy was all an attempt to confront the unhinged madness of the world. And none of us should have been surprised that his work became even more peculiar and more precise as the world became more and more insane. Maybe that’s why Asteroid City feels like such a signature work. Anderson doubles down on his style (how is that even possible at this point?) and gives us a maze-like network of framing devices to tell a story about a group of teenage scientists and their traumatized parents confronting an alien life form in the 1950s. Or wait, is it actually a story about the Actors Studio and turn-of-the-century American theater’s attempt to wrestle with the intricacies of the human heart? Or maybe these are the same thing. Anderson uses all the technique at his disposal to create a beautiful diorama of a world he cannot understand. In the end, isn’t that what great art does? Ira Sachs is a master of the small, delicate gestures that wind up having seismic repercussions in our lives. In Passages, which might be his masterpiece, he fashions the most delectably ruinous of love triangles. A German filmmaker (Franz Rogowski) cheats on his husband (Ben Whishaw) with a woman (Adèle Exarchopoulos), falls in love with her, then begins to have second thoughts as the specter of commitment looms. Rogowski’s character is a total narcissist — a needy, callous, pathetic, selfish chaos agent — but go figure, he’s also quite irresistible. We’re drawn to this man despite the emotional devastation he wreaks, maybe because we sense something of ourselves in him. His destructive immaturity is captivating and relatable. Many of the year’s best films capture the queasy uncertainty of living in this moment, but few do it with such oblique charm as Aki Kaurismaki in this understated romance following two lonely, mismatched souls who keep missing each other. Kaurismaki’s style — somehow both deadpan and tender — is timeless, and one could argue that his stories could be taking place at any moment in history. But look at the ways in which his characters constantly seem on the verge of being tossed aside by the post-human, industrial landscape of Helsinki, and listen to the way that the music on the radio has been replaced by news reports about the war in Ukraine. The world has no place for the individual. And yet here we still are, persisting and yearning and drinking and stewing and fumbling our way through. Ava Duvernay has been so ever-present in the public eye that it’s wild to think this is her first feature film in five years, not to mention her first drama — the genre she truly excels at — in nearly a decade. She adapts Isabel Wilkerson’s monumental nonfiction study Caste as a cross between a historical mystery and a memoir, making the writer (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) her protagonist. Thus, we see the personal tragedies Wilkerson dealt with during her research, which adds an emotional urgency to her journey. But the film’s real power lies in Duvernay’s ability to jump across historical events, anecdotes, and images, forging connections that are at times revelatory and devastating, creating something that at times feels like both essay film and melodrama. Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s films were never not ambitious, but they’ve become even more so over the years, all the while remaining confined to the rural Turkish small towns whose lives the director chronicles so well. His latest, clocking in at a mesmerizing 197 minutes, follows a middle school teacher (Deniz Celiloglu) whose attitude toward the people around him — be they students, fellow teachers, or ordinary citizens — is alternately patronizing, compassionate, and contemptuous. Not unlike with Passages, at times one wonders if this film could have been titled The Worst Person in the World, even as it’s clear that the filmmaker recognizes much of himself in the protagonist. Ceylan has never been a directly political filmmaker, but About Dry Grasses provides an astute analysis of the modern Turkish intellectual’s place in society, in all its infuriating complications, its social paralysis, and self-defeating self-absorption. Wim Wenders released two marvelous films this year (his 3-D documentary Anselm was another triumph, though it just missed my list) and I hope he makes at least a dozen more pictures before he’s through. But in some ways, Perfect Days represents a culmination of the director’s journey. Wenders’s restless, angst-ridden protagonists have always been searching for blissful oblivion. These weren’t ambitious characters but rather people looking for a center. All those road movies — where were they headed? Perfect Days provides a kind of answer. A quiet, middle-aged man lives in a modest Tokyo home, gets up every morning and goes about his day cleaning the city’s toilets. There are hints of a past heartbreak, but they’re nothing more than gentle nods to the fact that all of us come from somewhere. There’s no sense that this person needs to do more, no sense that his life is being wasted. If anything, he is more aware of how lucky he is to be here than any of us. Is this what happiness looks like? Once upon a time, Michael Mann was the king of composed beauty — a director of impeccable frames, of telling postures, of ethereal moods. Over the years, especially as he began to experiment with digital video, his work became more frenetic, more abstract, more reflective of the cacophony of our many-screened visual culture. In Ferrari, a project he’s been trying to realize for several decades, he brings the different sides of his directorial persona together, creating a film that veers between classicism in its domestic scenes and rip-roaring kineticism in its racing scenes. It’s all held together beautifully by Adam Driver as the aging Enzo Ferrari and Penélope Cruz as his wife, Laura, grieving parents and feuding spouses locked in tight emotional combat. Like a warm blanket made of asbestos, Alexander Payne’s comedy-drama about winter break at a boys’ boarding school has a cozy surface familiarity that’s slowly revealed to be toxic. Paul Giamatti — an actor who cannot be compared to any other actor in human history, in any medium — plays a history teacher living resolutely in the past. The stellar Da’Vine Joy Randolph is the grieving head cook who can neither move forward nor look back, and lightning-bolt newcomer Dominic Sessa is a troubled, unloved teen hurtling headlong into an uncertain future. Payne’s fondness for quiet, casual moments blends well with the film’s lo-fi aesthetic, which mimics the textures of a picture from the 1970s. This also means that formally, the movie is fixated on the past the way Giamatti’s character is. Even the nods to the Vietnam War throughout play like coy references to a controversial subject, as they would have been in 1970. Nevertheless, growth is possible. In Payne’s work, one individual’s foibles and failings can open another’s perception; his humans lead not by example, but through their flaws. This is one of the director’s greatest films. So many biopics tried this year not to be biopics, to the point that the films’ publicists politely but firmly requested that we not call them biopics. Christopher Nolan didn’t seem to have any such worries. Oppenheimer is a proud biopic: a dense, big-swing condensation of a 600-page biography about one of the most important men of the 20th century and about (in the movie’s own words) “the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world.” But Oppenheimer is also the opposite of a standard-issue Great Man movie: The achievement here is monstrous, and the psychic dissolution of the main character before our very eyes is heartbreaking. Nolan wants to enter J. Robert Oppenheimer’s mind, to see the “hidden universe” that quantum physics opened up and thus convey the psychic prison in which the scientist found himself after ushering in the nuclear age. That the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages. All of horror’s liveliest developments bubbled up from the genre’s raw edges this year — and, more than anything, from the internet. A24’s hit Talk to Me was the product of two Australian YouTubers, while Kyle Edward Ball’s Skinamarink was born out of creepy-pasta tropes and liminal spaces videos. But it’s another debut, Robbie Banfitch’s found-footage Mojave Desert freakout The Outwaters, that’s stubbornly stuck with me for months, and I only heard about it because of how much it polarized horror fans online. Made for a reported $15,000, and heavily improvised, The Outwaters sounds Blair Witch–like on paper, down to the camping trip its group of four friends is taking. But the actual experience of watching it is an astonishing array of dreamlike imagery as the trip goes from mundane to macabre. A stranger’s bloody limbs glimpsed by flashlight at night give way to sights that are even more disturbing in the harsh daylight, and Banfitch, who also stars in the film, appears at different times to be a victim of whatever’s happening and one of its perpetrators. He may not be working with much by way of resources, but what he accomplishes in this borderline experimental movie knocked my socks off — never more so than the moment when his protagonist somehow finds himself on the wing of a plane like the one he takes home at the start of the film, as though he’s always been caught in this nightmare and only now sees it. James Gunn has headed off to the unenviable job of getting another superhero house in order at a corporation that’s willing to etherize even his own movie for tax purposes. But before he did, he demonstrated that he’s the best thing that ever happened to the MCU — not that I really needed the reminder as someone who’s always been hugely susceptible to his signature mix of the profane, the brutal, the sentimental, and the unexpectedly sublime. The decade’s most dominant genre has calcified into not just a formula but an ongoing advertisement for itself that viewers are expected to be grateful to pay for, and in the face of that, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 manages to be more than honest-to-god entertainment, one that has the liberated weirdness of material (like a stealth We3 adaptation) that was never expected to find a mass audiences. It even makes Chris Pratt likable as it brings Star-Lord full circle, from a kid who runs away from grief into the eternal arrested development of a space opera into an adult who finally goes home. Most of the films that were shot during the pandemic retain some essence of the pandemic, whether it has anything to do with what’s onscreen or not. But this 62-minute feature, which is enveloping as the lush night in which it takes place, somehow doesn’t, despite being shot in 2020 after filmmaker Tyler Taormina moved back to his childhood home on Long Island. Happer’s Comet feels, instead, untethered from any particular moment, a dialogue-free tribute to the isolation of suburbia that manages to feel as luxurious as it does lonely. The film skips through space, capturing snapshots rather than trying to assemble anything resembling a story. An older woman takes a break from leafing through a flier to lay her head on her dining room table and smile; a mechanic staffing an auto-body shop with no company except the tinny sound of a radio drops down and starts doing push-ups; a dog sits in a living room watching an off-screen television. Taormina’s images are as undeniably beautiful as they are eerie — the streetlamps and taillights of a parked car glow with equal warmth on an quiet road — but it’s the solitude they exude that makes them so inviting, as though getting a peek into a million private moments. As characters strap on roller skates and go wheeling out into the dark streets, it feels unclear if what’s motivating them is a desire for company or a chance to revel in the indulgence of all those empty spaces. A. V. Rockwell’s first film has the sweep of a novel and the fiercest of spirits, and it’s anchored by a remarkable performance by Teyana Taylor as the resolute Inez de la Paz. Fresh from Rikers in 1994, Inez promptly kidnaps her son, Terry, from a neglectful foster situation in Brooklyn and spirits him uptown to Harlem, where she grew up, and where she’ll eventually link up with an ex, Lucky (William Catlett), in a development that, like most of the ones in the film, doesn’t lead at all where you might expect. A Thousand and One is a gorgeous, moving work about people trying to carve out a family life for themselves with no models to pull from and in the face of a city that becomes increasingly hostile to their existence with every supposed improvement and who fuck up and hurt each other and keep going, because the only other option is to give up. Even while dealing in larger themes, Rockwell always lets her characters lead the way — they are never anything less than vividly alive as they make their way through a teeming metropolis it’s all too easy to disappear into. There’s a formal rigor to playwright Tina Satter’s directorial debut that contrasts starkly with the panicky, pulse-fluttering experience of actually watching it. Satter took her dialogue verbatim from the transcripts of whistleblower Reality Winner’s interrogation by the FBI on June 3, 2017, the day of her arrest, redactions and all — when the film gets to a line that was blacked out, the actors glitch out and briefly vanish from the frame, as though their actual performances had been temporarily excised by the State. And yet there’s nothing removed about Sydney Sweeney’s performance as Reality, which unfolds in micro-expressions as her character tries to pretend — or will herself to believe — that what’s happening to her isn’t such a big deal. As men pour into Reality’s shitty Augusta, Georgia, rental house and start documenting the minutiae of her life, the camera closes in on Sweeney’s increasingly stricken face as though trying to peer into her character’s head. It’s a claustrophobic, masterful work that, in the space of 82 minutes, allows you to witness in intimate detail a young woman’s life getting imploded by the might of the State. Jonathan Glazer’s film portrays a key figure in the Holocaust not as the embodiment of virulent hatred but as a product of compartmentalization and ambition, which turns out to be even more disturbing. I’m not sure there is a viewing experience this year that is simultaneously as stunning and stifling as The Zone of Interest, which subjects you to the bourgeois aspirations and careerist angst of Rudolf (Christian Friedel) and Hedwig Höss (Sandra Hüller), who’ve achieved their dream home right next to the death camp at Auschwitz, which Rudolf oversees. The austerity of Glazer’s approach is unforgiving, presenting the mundanity of the Höss’s concerns, from Hedwig’s pride in her garden to the transfer Rudolf is given that Hedwig refuses to accompany him during, against an always-present-but-never-peered-into backdrop of atrocity. The horror next door only occasionally manages to intrude into carefully partitioned-off consciousnesses of the family, as when a swimming trip with the children is cut short by an encounter with some of the gruesome by-products of the camp. But in a late scene that connects his film to Joshua Oppenheimer’s crucial documentary The Act of Killing, Glazer posits that sometimes the body can revolt against the brutal truths the mind tries to tamp down. Leave it to Hayao Miyazaki to pack so much mourning, self-doubt, resentment, and hope into a movie about a secret kingdom filled with winsome, ravenous anthropomorphic birds. There’s more to The Boy and the Heron than that, of course, including a backdrop of World War II Japan, autobiographical resonances, a pregnant stepmother who’s also an aunt, a gray heron who’s also a grouchy man, and the dream logic of the ocean-dominated otherworld where souls rise up as adorable spirits to be born into our reality. But what’s so compelling about Miyazaki’s epic latest, which will hopefully also not be his last, is the way that the magical serves as an emotional allegory for what 12-year-old Mahito (Soma Santoki) is going through rather than something literal. Mahito’s wizardlike granduncle retreated from reality to create a beguiling but unsteady alternate universe that he needs someone “free of malice” to take over. The Boy and the Heron is about accepting loss but also accepting that you are part of the world, in all its brokenness and all its potential. Lila Avilés’s dazzling family drama takes place over a single day, during which the relatives of a 7-year-old girl named Sol (Naíma Sentíes) gather at her grandfather’s house to throw a surprise birthday party for her father, Tona (Mateo García Elizondo). That Tona is likely to die soon from the cancer that’s reduced him to a husk is clear to everyone except Tótem’s young protagonist, who struggles to understand why her dad doesn’t always want to see her (or anyone) and tries to make sense of the behavior of the grief-stricken grown-ups around her. Avilés’s film combines the avid curiosity of a child with the steady wisdom of an adult, and as it whirls through party prep and the bickering of family members — over a cake, over the bathroom, over Tona’s decision to forgo treatment, over a spiritualist brought in to cleanse the home — it approaches its large ensemble of characters with a tenderness that’s almost unbearable. Without ever verging on cloying, it’s a film about death that becomes a heartfelt celebration of life. Todd Haynes’s latest is a brilliant ode to female toxicity that begins at a place of camp and ends at one that’s closer to horror. The Mary Kay Letourneau–inspired Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore) lisps and bakes and enforces her desired illusion of fairy-tale domesticity by way of a high-femme terrorism that involves weaponized tears and velvet barbs winged at her family members. As Elizabeth Berry, the actor set to play Gracie in an upcoming movie, Natalie Portman is all careful platitudes and hungry eyes, talking a big game about doing justice to the story of how a 36-year-old Gracie seduced the then-13 Joe Yoo (Charles Melton), who she later married, while barely concealing her ravenous glee at the ripeness of the material she’s harvesting. Haynes showcases these dueling characters and the outsize performances behind them with an appreciative wryness that’s deceptive (as Moore opens the fridge, the score lets loose with a dramatic twang before she observes “I don’t think we have enough hot dogs”). It’s Joe who emerges as the film’s wounded soul, played by an impressive Melton as a 30-something man frozen somewhere in adolescence by his experiences, blinking in disbelief at the life he’s found himself in as though just waking up to the reality of what happened to him. It’s a heartbreaking turn, and the way it’s deployed onscreen makes May December the year’s most complex and layered watch. This year has given me a lot of “the old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born” feelings about the movies, between the contraction of the streaming model (which maybe never made sense to begin with in terms of profitability?), the floundering of Disney, the faltering of once-massive franchises, the triumphant labor movements, and the incursion of pop stars into the multiplexes. I’m hardly mourning the corporate structures that have dominated the last decade plus, but I have no idea what comes next. I just know that there’s been no better movie to encapsulate the year, and no better movie, period, than Kelly Reichardt’s matchless Showing Up, which is all about making art in a world that also requires you to make money. As Lizzy, a sculptor and admin assistant at a real arts college that (a little too fittingly) went under a few years ago for financial reasons, Michelle Williams has the perfectly pinched aura of a bluestocking dropped in sun-dappled present-day Portland. But her concerns — her ability to make her delicate clay sculptures of little ladies while also balancing a day job, the enviable self-interest of her frenemy-rival artist-landlord Jo (a delightful Hong Chau) — are palpable enough to feel like they could belong to Reichardt herself, the pressing intertwined with the petty in ways that are deeply relatable. Is it possible to support yourself and still have enough left over to do the work you love? Showing Up, which also features a turn from passion project flautist André Benjamin, doesn’t have an answer. What it does have is an inexpressibly lovely affirmation of the meaning of making art that you believe in, even if it only reaches a select but appreciative audience. Good job, girls. This year saw several major superhero movies go bust (and as of this writing, we don’t know if Aquaman will be another one). It saw Disney deliver one bona fide animated flop (Wish) and another that exists in the liminal space between flop and hit (Elemental). We also saw Netflix starting to pull back on the mountains of money it throws toward film productions. Many of us have been anticipating (maybe even hoping for) the end of the franchise era. But now that it might be happening, what lies on the other side? Throughout 2023, our critics maintained “Best Movies of the Year (So Far)” lists. Some of those selections appear above in our Top 10 picks. Below are more of the films (but not all) that stood out to them this year. Low-budget action master Jessie V. Johnson directed this down-and-dirty period slaughterfest about a woman who becomes a powerful warrior after her husband, the leader of the Iceni, is killed by the Romans. As the title character, a legendary figure in ancient British history, the great Olga Kurylenko convincingly goes from meek, tender, and deferential to mad, snarling, and murderous. Don’t expect much historical analysis or period accuracy or emotional nuance; this one works on your lizard brain. It’s like a dimestore Braveheart: It might not have the sweep of those old-school period action films, but it’s still thrilling and passionate and filled with bloodcurdling, wall-to-wall violence. —B.E. Kaouther Ben Hania’s hybrid documentary has a remarkable conceit, telling the story of Olfa Hamrouni, a Tunisian mother, and her four daughters by restaging scenes from their eventful, terrifying lives. Two of the girls play themselves; the other two are played by actresses, because, as Olfa says, they “were devoured by the wolves.” What she actually means by that becomes clear over the course of the film (though Tunisians who remember this news item from recent history may know where the story goes), as we learn about Olfa’s marriage, the abuse in her family, and how her daughters gradually embraced a form of militant, fundamentalist Islam that tore their family apart. An actress is hired to play Olfa during the more difficult scenes, and we see dryly funny and slyly terrifying footage of the real Olfa coaching her double how to act. In telling the story of Olfa and her daughters, Ben Hania (whose 2019 film The Man Who Sold His Skin was nominated for an Oscar) is also telling the tumultuous story of Tunisia in the wake of the Arab Spring, a promising movement that began in that country before spreading to the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. —B.E. It would be tempting to say that Killers of the Flower Moon is Martin Scorsese’s attempt at a western, and one could also see in it yet another gangster epic from a man who’s made his share of them. But in adapting David Grann’s acclaimed 2017 nonfiction history, about a yearslong conspiracy to murder members of the Osage nation in an effort to accrue their oil wealth, Scorsese and screenwriter Eric Roth have turned it into that simplest and slipperiest of things: the story of a marriage. The film is at its best when showing the growing relationship between Mollie Brown (Lily Gladstone), a member of a large and wealthy Osage family, and Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a WWI veteran who arrives in town to work for his uncle, William Hale (Robert De Niro), a local godfather type. The most uncomfortable aspect of Killers of the Flower Moon is not the spectacular criminality on display but rather how it’s treated by so many of the characters as no big deal. These are typically Scorsesean ideas: our offhand capacity for evil, the inherent violence of relationships, the strain of serving two masters. In so many ways, though, this is Lily Gladstone’s movie. She plays Mollie with a mix of standoffishness and exhausted hope. As the horrors mount around her, she navigates her queasy, gathering suspicions as well as her affection for her husband. When he tells Mollie he loves her, she believes him. And so do we. That is, in many ways, the great, cruel, unreconciled tragedy at the heart of this tale. —B.E. Argentine director Rodrigo Moreno’s film is being billed as a heist movie, which is not technically incorrect; it is, in fact, about a man who robs a bank and then coaxes a co-worker into an elaborate scheme to get away with it. But at heart, The Delinquents is about leaving an oppressive world behind and discovering the possibility of freedom in a new one. The thieves here are not looking to get rich. “Three and a half years in jail, or 25 at the bank?” is how Morán (Daniel Elias) puts it to his colleague Román (Esteban Bigliardi), explaining why he’s resorted to crime. The plan is quite simple: Morán will confess to the robbery and get three years in prison. Román will hide the money in the meantime. Afterward, the two men will have just enough to not have to work for a living. But is such a goal, such a world, even possible? Moreno’s film is really about the wait in between, about what happens as these two men bide their time. Clocking in at 183 minutes, this is a movie of detours both narrative and formal. But it’s never boring or tedious. The Delinquents works its magic on us the way that the promise of freedom works on its characters. It’s a vision of a life unlived — as impossible as it is intoxicating. —B.E. This brutal Argentine horror film takes place in a reality in which possessions are both known and spreadable, transforming the infected into malevolent, oozing masses of flesh that are referred to as “Rottens.” But what makes Demián Rugna’s film so effective is not the gore (which is appropriately gross!) or the idea of a demonic contagion — it’s the way that the weaknesses of human nature, on both a personal and a systemic level, make stopping the corruption almost impossible once it appears. When a Rotten turns up on land near the farm owned by brothers Pedro (Ezequiel Rodríguez) and Jaime (Demián Salomon), the local authorities pass the buck while insisting that everyone is overreacting. But Pedro, the closest thing the film has to a hero, is anything but. He ends up doing more damage in his flailing efforts to help and to save his children, a sequence that plays like a grim comedy of errors. Rugna was apparently inspired by health issues caused by pesticide in his native country, though the film’s combination of misinformation, denial, and institutional failures invariably brings to mind the early days of COVID. —A.W. The artificial-intelligence framing is just bait — the robots in this sci-fi epic don’t actually have much bearing on our current conversations about ChatGPT. They are, instead, multifaceted metaphors for all sorts of groups that get othered, and the focus of Gareth Edwards’s unexpectedly grown-up movie is less the AIs themselves than how they’re treated by the American forces that are battling to wipe them from existence. The Creator riffs on both Vietnam War movies and Blade Runner as it sends a never-better John David Washington into a war-torn Southeast Asia to look for the woman (Gemma Chan) he loved and betrayed, never seeming sure as to what he would say if he found her. Edwards, always good with visual effects, offers up stunning, lived-in landscapes in which brutalist metal towers coexist alongside paddy fields and villages. —A.W. Documentarian Claire Simon explains what she’s setting out to do at the start of the astonishing Our Body — to explore the “mostly female world” of the women’s health ward of a Parisian hospital, “treating the gynecological pathologies that weigh down on our lives, on our loves, on our hopes, on our desires.” Over the course of her almost three-hour film, she turns her camera to moments of vulnerability, sorrow, and joy as a woman records the voice of her crying newborn after giving birth alone, as a trans teenager learns he’ll have to wait until he’s 18 to go ahead with medical procedures his father refuses to consent to, and as a young woman weeps while talking about the pain she’s started experiencing during sex with her new husband. There’s an expansive generosity to the film, and to the willingness of its subjects to allow these moments to be documented, that’s met with the same openness from Simon when a diagnosis means that she’s no longer just the director but a patient herself. —A.W. Sebastien Marnier’s slow-boiling thriller weaves such a mood of sinister duplicity that you might want to take a shower afterward. It follows Stephane (Laure Calamy), a cannery worker with a girlfriend in prison, who reconnects with Serge (Jacques Weber), the wealthy businessman she claims is her father. Serge’s family is immediately suspicious, but it’s clear they’ve got their own designs on the man’s wealth. Everybody in this movie seems to be lying through their teeth. In less sure hands, this could have resulted in annoyance. But Marnier and his terrific cast know just how much to reveal and when. They keep us delightfully unmoored. —B.E. Kenneth Branagh’s Hercule Poirot mysteries haven’t exactly set the film world on fire, so the fact that the director-star continues to make them clearly speaks to his love for these stories and this character. In the latest, A Haunting in Venice, he forsakes the swooping cameras and epic vistas and frantic pacing of the previous films for something stranger, more insular, and maybe even more refined. He takes Agatha Christie’s little-discussed 1969 novel, Hallowe’en Party, and turns it into a moody, staccato thriller about the unknown. He also takes quite a few liberties with the original along the way, transporting the story to Venice in 1947 and bringing in a supernatural undercurrent. This allows for some jump-scares, but it also makes Poirot more intriguing: His refusal to believe in matters of the spirit isn’t just due to his devotion to science and reason — it’s also a measure of his brokenness. —B.E. Pablo Larraín’s latest film presents General Augusto Pinochet, the brutal, U.S.-backed military dictator who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990 and died in 2006, still with the blood of thousands on his hands, as a literal vampire. So, what is it? Horror? Satire? Allegory? Political thriller? Family drama? It’s got all these elements in it, but it’s also very much its own thing — an elegantly shot film whose competing tones create something delirious and new. But beneath all the genre theatrics, what comes through most vividly in El Conde are Larraín’s sadness and rage at what happened to his country. —B.E. If anything, Emma Seligman’s follow-up to Shiva Baby could be even more anarchic, but as is, it’s a blissfully silly, unabashedly violent, and often daring time. Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri are a comedy duo for the ages as PJ and Josie, lesbian outcasts who found a women’s self-defense class/fight club at their high school and accidentally create a space for feminist solidarity, though the two of them are just trying to get laid. Both are very funny, and the cast features other standouts too — like Marshawn Lynch as the club’s soon-to-be-divorced adviser and Kaia Gerber as the school’s second-most-popular cheerleader. —A.W. In Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s absorbing, suspenseful drama, a French couple attempt to start an organic farm and rehabilitate a desolate stretch of property in a rural Spanish village. But the locals, who are trying to sell their land off for development by a wind-energy company, see the couple as stuck-up foreigners trying to prevent them from making money and leaving this place. Sorogoyen might give lip service to the economic realities underlying the land dispute, but he’s also not afraid to take sides and to entertain. As the growing hostility between the man and woman and their neighbors eventually reaches Straw Dogs–esque proportions, it becomes clear the director wants to make us feel his protagonists’ growing helplessness and the gnawing tension of living right next door to people who might genuinely want to kill you. —B.E. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig, Barbie has become a Rorschach-inkblot purity test about feminism, womanhood, and the state of the industry itself. Is Barbie feminist or is it merely a marker of capitalism’s cunning, taking the emblems but not of the soul of the feminist movement? Is it just a slick toy commercial or is it actually reckoning with the cultural weight of Barbie with wit? I think the truth is rather complex, making Barbie operate as a woman’s picture, a feminist argument, and film defined by its delirious interest in the pleasure principle. No matter where you’ve drawn your lines on this cultural battlefield, it’s hard to deny that Barbie is fun as hell. Led by star-producer Margot Robbie, Barbie is a pink funhouse brimming with glittering dance numbers, heartfelt monologues, and a genuine curiosity about not just womanhood but humanity itself. Everyone in the cast brings their A-game. Ryan Gosling undoubtedly has the boldest performance as the yearning himbo Ken, whose entire existence is in service of basking in Barbie’s warm gaze. Issa Rae and Hari Nef are equal delights for some deranged line readings alone. America Ferrera is the stealth MVP for her juicy monologue that extols the constrictions on women. Robbie cements her position as a true new star in Hollywood’s firmament by helping craft a film that has a capacious curiosity and joyful aesthetics that speak toward the wild, yearning nature of being alive. —A.J.B. Juel Taylor’s genre-bending directorial debut is a vibrant, snappy melding of sci-fi concepts, social commentary, and blaxploitation homage with John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris starring as broadly drawn types — a drug dealer, a pimp, and a sex worker — who discover that the seemingly inescapable patterns of their lives in a neighborhood called the Glen aren’t accidental and are actually the result of a government conspiracy. With so many Netflix original movies these days feeling like algorithmic filler, They Cloned Tyrone is the rare offering that doesn’t just feel like it’s made by a person but by someone with an eye for visual, a distinctive voice, and a sharp sense of humor. —A.W. Forest fires rage in the distance in Christian Petzold’s entrancing film, which doesn’t stop its characters — novelist Leon (Thomas Schubert), photographer Felix (Langston Uibel), seasonal worker Nadja (Paula Beer), and rescue swimmer Devid (Enno Trebs) — from flirting and fighting over shared meals outside the beach house that’s Afire’s primary setting. Throughout the film, it’s Leon’s tetchiness over the failings of his second manuscript that threaten to derail the seaside idyll, but the potential for more serious danger always lurks in the background. The wonder of Petzold’s work is that it revels in the unblemished youthfulness of its characters while allowing that, in order to make great art, it helps to have endured some pain. —A.W. Free-diving — trying to reach record depths by simply holding your breath and diving as far as you can — is one of the deadliest sports on the face of the Earth, and Laura McGann’s documentary has quite a challenge: How to tell its story without feeling like it’s exploiting a potential tragedy. The film opens with champion Italian diver Alessia Zecchini blacking out at the end of one of her dives, then flashes back across the years to show her love for the sport and her rise to the top, all the while interweaving the story of Stephen Keenan, an Irish free diver who eventually became an expert safety diver and coach. Those familiar with the story will know where it’s all headed. Others — that would be most viewers, probably — will wonder how these two lives will ultimately intersect. Documentary purists who balk at movies hiding real-life tragedies from their viewers until the end will probably break out in hives. But McGann doesn’t really hide the nature of her story. It’s clear pretty early on that we’re watching something harrowing. This is, ultimately, an elegant and deeply moving picture. —B.E. The latest Mission: Impossible movie, as suggested by that ominous “part one,” seems to care a bit more about its plot than previous entries, and it’s not hard to see why. This time, Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt isn’t fighting nihilistic terrorists or vaporous international-espionage networks but an all-powerful artificial intelligence known as “the Entity,” a variation on the man-versus-machine theme that Cruise pursued in last year’s Top Gun: Maverick. It’s also a rather compelling metaphor for the actor’s well-publicized dedication to old-school action filmmaking and real-life stunt work. But if Dead Reckoning spends a bit too much time slowly (and repeatedly) spelling out what the Entity is and what it can do and why that’s capital-B Bad, it can be forgiven, because all that exposition serves as a kind of spiritual justification for the bravado on display. And the film is filled with amazing action set pieces, including the star’s much-publicized death-defying motorcycle-parachute jump over — or rather into — an immense Norwegian canyon as well as the most hair-raising train derailment ever put to film. Whenever it gets down to the business of making Tom Cruise run and jump and drive and fly in and out of things, Dead Reckoning manages to astonish. —B.E. Read Bilge Ebiri’s full review of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One and Jason Bailey’s ranking of the best action sequences in the entire M:I franchise. Despite the spectacle of an effectively de-aged Harrison Ford walloping Nazis atop a train during World War II in its opening scenes, James Mangold’s film isn’t about the young Indiana Jones but about the aging and rather pathetic Dr. Henry Jones, now on the verge of retirement from teaching archaeology to sleepy Hunter College students, drinking himself silly in a grubby New York apartment. Into his life enters his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), the adventurous offspring of an old colleague, to drag him along on a chase for a contraption that can predict fissures in the very fabric of time, thereby allowing travel into the past. Not unlike The Force Awakens did with the original Star Wars, Dial of Destiny feels at times like a remix, offering variations on elements from earlier Indiana Jones movies. Mangold may not have the young Steven Spielberg’s musical flair for extravagant action choreography (who does?), but he is a tougher, leaner director, using a tighter frame and keeping his camera close. That may shortchange the escapist atmosphere and evocative exotica of the material, but it does bring a ground-level immediacy to the action. Plus all the vehicular mayhem probably suits this older, slower version of Indy, who fights less but often finds himself in the middle of any number of “wouldn’t it be cool if” chases: motorcycles and tuk-tuks and trains and Jaguars and horses and planes in all manner of arrangements and rearrangements as well as one delirious final sequence that had me giggling with delight. No, it’s not Raiders of the Lost Ark; no movie is. But it’s too entertaining to dismiss. —B.E. Pietro Marcello’s previous feature, 2020’s brilliant Martin Eden, was an ambitious adaptation that attempted to graft a Jack London novel onto the entire history of the 20th century. With Scarlet, he works in a gentler register, though the ambition is still there. In its opening scenes, a gruff, quiet man, Raphaël (Raphaël Thiéry), returns from World War I to discover that his wife is dead and that he has a young daughter. He and the girl live with a group of women who are outcasts from the community, and he soon becomes an outcast as well. This rough man’s daughter (played as a young woman by Juliette Jouan) turns out to be the most delicate of creatures, a romantic young woman with a connection to the divine. This beguiling film has the cadences of a fairy tale — prophetic visions, magical coincidences, behavior echoed across the years — but Marcello, who came up through the documentary world, expertly blends the immediate and the airy. —B.E. Georgia Oakley’s feature debut is an anguished look at life in the closet set in Northeast England in 1988 — the year the Thatcher administration introduced a set of laws banning the “promotion of homosexuality” in the name of protecting children. Jean, played by a terrific Rosy McEwen in her first leading role, has painstakingly compartmentalized her existence. At night, she hangs out at a lesbian bar with her girlfriend, Viv (Kerrie Hayes), a part of herself she keeps secret from her co-workers and students at the school where she works as a gym teacher in the day. Blue Jean is a moody, delicately wrought film about how Jean, damaged from past experiences and her own internalized homophobia, is unable to feel like she belongs in either of the worlds she created for herself. The justification for the impending legislation in the background of the film may sound all too familiar, but Blue Jean’s real power comes from its examination of the human costs of living in fear. —A.W. Not to be corny, but I teared up a few times during the opening scenes of this sequel to 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse just from how good it all looked. Somehow, the animation is even more impressive and imaginative, as the film gives us new universes done in soft watercolors and futuristic detail while also returning us to the embrace of the vibrant, comic-book-art–inspired Brooklyn that its teenage hero, Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), inhabits. Across the Spider-Verse ends on a to-be-continued, but it’s hard to complain about that when it’s so rich with detail and so beautifully crafted — a riff on multiverse storytelling that also becomes a heartfelt exploration of parenting and accepting that growing up means that your child is going to encounter pain you can’t shelter them from. —A.W. Based on a real-life case, Dominik Moll’s thriller follows the lengthy investigation into the grisly burning death of a young woman in a small town near Grenoble. An opening title informs us that this was but one of many unsolved murders in France, a disquieting bit of information with which to kick off a mystery, telling us there won’t be a final solution to the case. This subtly draws our attention to other aspects of the story: to the interactions among the cops investigating the case, to the humdrum bureaucracy of police work, and to a general feeling of haunted desolation in this provincial area nestled next to the French Alps. The film won six awards at this year’s César Awards, including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, but there seems to be very little buzz around its U.S. release. Even so, it feels major, with an unsettling mood that recalls such previous policier masterpieces as David Fincher’s Zodiac and Bong Joon Ho’s Memories of Murder. Its real-world mysteries eventually become existential ones, but the movie never stops sending chills up your spine. —B.E. As the ultracorporate “shark” Jim Balsillie, Glenn Howerton is a near-comical vision of drive and animalistic ambition, and his character turns out to be just who the clumsy, introverted nerds who founded Research in Motion (RIM), the tiny company that would transform the cell-phone industry, need to make their harebrained schemes reality. Directed by Matt Johnson, BlackBerry basically presents the rise of the smartphone as a sitcom pitch: What happens when two affable, not-ready-for-prime-time dorks from Waterloo, Canada — brilliant engineer Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his can-do cheerleader pal Doug Fregin (Johnson) — are joined by a crisply suited, Harvard-educated, phone-smashing apex predator. One of the great pleasures of BlackBerry is watching Balsillie’s befuddled, running disgust at Lazaridis and Fregin’s hapless ways, at the chaotic ineptitude of their finances, their utter lack of business sense, and their go-along-to-get-along management style. I would happily watch several seasons of these three going at it. —B.E. This is a largely wordless World War II thriller about a grizzled, haunted loner who strikes a massive vein of gold in the remote reaches of Lapland, only to find himself tormented by a platoon of retreating Nazis. The year is 1944, and the war is basically lost for the Germans, who are laying waste to everything in their path. As the Nazis chase him, our hero picks them off, sometimes individually and sometimes en masse. What keeps it from being repetitive and predictable is director Jalmari Helander’s increasingly creative ideas about how his hero should go about wasting the Nazis in his path, as the film graduates from humble head stabbings and limb snappings to more ambitious and explosive mayhem. So much so that it all starts to border on a philosophical treatise about survival and perseverance. Some will say Sisu recalls Mad Max: Fury Road or Inglourious Basterds, but I kept imagining it as what might have happened had Sergio Leone been alive to direct Crank: High Voltage. —B.E. Like the characters in Brokeback Mountain, the men in this drama from Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch bond during an Edenic summer in the wilderness, and while their relationship is platonic, the film is no less a love story. Pietro (Luca Marinelli) and Bruno (Alessandro Borghi) are childhood friends who reunite as adults to build a cabin up in the mountains where Bruno grew up and Pietro’s family used to spend the summers — a breathtaking location that becomes a place the two return to as the years pass. The Eight Mountains offers all sorts of ecstatically beautiful footage of the Italian Alps, but it also spins out a delicate, rueful story about trying to find a balance between nature and work, as its two characters take divergent routes in their search for a meaningful life. —A.W. The comedy troupe Broken Lizard met at Colgate back in 1989 and never spiritually left college. Thank God for that. Their work still feels like a group of amiable stoners from across the hall came up with a bunch of dumb, funny ideas to put into a movie and then filmed it all the following morning. A riff on The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Quasi may be their first period piece, but it’s basically the same vibes-based silliness. Steve Lemme plays Quasimodo, a torture-chamber employee who gets caught in a petty but murderous tiff between the pope and the king. One can easily imagine a version of this movie where the plot is handled with urgency, authenticity, and suspense, but then what would you be left with? The Broken Lizard guys understand that their brand of handmade, good-natured humor doesn’t really work with tighter storytelling or sharper acting, and they’ve honed their approach well over the years. They’re always winking at us because they know theirs is a fundamentally participatory style of comedy; the process is part of the joke. They keep making cult movies so that when you watch them, you feel as if you were there when they made them. Broken Lizard is all of us. —B.E. Makoto Shinkai’s latest is another of the openhearted romantic fantasies he’s so good at, a road-trip adventure about an orphaned teenage girl who helps save Japan from a mythical worm whose intrusions into our world cause massive earthquakes. But despite featuring both a mysterious love interest and a talking cat, Suzume is a more pensive affair than it first appears, one that reflects what it means to come of age when the future feels so uncertain. Suzume (Nanoka Hara) and her companion, Souta (Hokuto Matsumura) — a dreamboat who, hilariously, spends most of his time magically transformed into a three-legged chair — cross the country trying to close up portals that open in areas that have been abandoned because of disasters or the shrinking population, as though patching up the tears in a social fabric that’s wearing thin all over. It’s a swoony, gorgeously animated movie that earns its sadness as well as its ecstatic bursts of hope. —A.W. It’s possible that no scene this year will be more entertaining than the one in which Signe (Kristine Kujath Thorp), a Norwegian woman with a pathological need to be the center of attention, lies to the chef at a fancy dinner about having severe nut allergies, then forgets she said that and eats something with nuts while the whole table looks on in horrified expectation. But then, all of this Kristoffer Borgli movie is like that — a bitterly funny black comedy about narcissism and the paths people attempt to take to fame. When Signe’s boyfriend, Thomas (Eirik Sæther), rises thanks to a dubious artistic career involving stolen furniture, Signe retaliates by taking a recalled Russian drug whose side effects include a horrifying skin condition. The perfectly paired sociopaths ricochet through Oslo as though each is involved in their own elaborate stunt that never actually ends. —A.W. Air, Ben Affleck’s enormously entertaining corporate drama about Nike’s efforts to sign Michael Jordan, might seem at first like a ridiculous idea for a movie, but it is in fact an ingenious one. The creation of the Air Jordan sneaker changed pop culture forever, and Jordan’s unprecedented profit-sharing deal with Nike would give athletes equity in the products they were being used to sell. The film situates the Air Jordan as a product of the runaway consumerism of the 1980s, but it also hints at a boundless, complex new world coming into view. In what will surely go down in history as one of the great sports-movie speeches, Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), the executive in charge of the shoe company’s basketball outreach, makes the point to Michael himself that the player practically exists outside of space and time. “Everyone at this table will be forgotten,” he says, noting all the executives gathered around them. “Except for you.” —B.E. In attempting to turn the classic fantasy role-playing game into a franchise picture, directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein somehow manage to play to the base while acknowledging the inherent ridiculousness and impenetrability of the concept. Their film is filled with medieval derring-do, unpronounceable fantasyspeak, and what I can only assume is a cornucopia of nerdtastic Easter eggs. But it’s also hilarious, with a game cast led by Chris Pine, a leading man who has turned making fun of his own leading manness into an art form. The film’s set pieces are built around comedy, with bits of (cleverly choreographed and directed) action to add some urgency, not the other way around. And the humor actually helps to up the suspense. Honor Among Thieves is the work of filmmakers who understand that the best way to take stuff like this seriously is not to take it seriously at all, and to have fun with it. —B.E. John Wick: Chapter 4 is blissfully entertaining, full of pratfalls and acting turns that make audiences swell with oohs, aahs, and yelps. It’s far more narratively focused than its previous sequels, while still managing to globe-trot a behemoth cast à la Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. Here, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) seeks to finally buy his freedom by dueling the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård). I have some reservations about the narrative choices, but the cinematic violence of Chapter 4 brought me the joy and erotic rush that has long powered the series. It synthesizes the zaniness of Looney Tunes and gags of Buster Keaton with martial-arts master classes that call back to the career of Jackie Chan and learn from more recent films like 2017’s South Korean action flick The Villainess. It’s a history lesson on what the body can do onscreen — its limits and its wonders. —A.J.B. Read Angelica Jade Bastién’s review of John Wick: Chapter 4, Chris Lee’s interview with filmmaker Chad Stahelski, and Bilge Ebiri’s analysis of the movie’s ending. This is the lightly fictionalized (and amazing) story of amateur historian Philippa Langley (Sally Hawkins), who in 2012 helped lead an archaeological expedition that dug up a nondescript Leicester car park and unearthed the remains of the notorious King Richard III. The bulk of the film tells of how Philippa came to be fascinated by the disgraced medieval monarch and fought not just to find his grave but also to counter the prevailing villainous narrative about him, which may well have been the work of Tudor propagandists. There’s an interesting tension in the film, between the exaltation of royal power on the one hand — a spiritual belief in the magic of lineage, itself dating back to arcane notions of divine right — and, on the other, the ennobling of common individuals, of ordinary people like Philippa as they butt heads with city councils and university administrators and academic mossbacks. The very act of reclaiming Richard’s legacy from his now-gone Tudor rivals puts the lie to the very idea of royalty, of bloodlines, and the eternal question of who gets to have power over whom. —B.E. The latest from award-winning, veteran Belgian realists Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne follows two African migrants in Belgium: 17-year-old Lokita (Joely Mbundu) and her 11-year-old “brother,” Tori (Pablo Schils). They’re not actually siblings. They’re not even from the same country. But they’ve formed an almost mystically strong bond ever since they met during their crossing to Europe and have now become inseparable. For all the sensitivity and sobriety of their work, what has made the Dardennes such effective filmmakers has been the subtle way they insert genre elements into their dramas. Each movie could be thought of as a thriller — often involving characters racing against the clock, entering places they mustn’t, or crossing people they shouldn’t. This one is no different: Tori and Lokita work for pennies at an Italian restaurant, singing songs for the customers, then dealing drugs all over the city for the joint’s owner so they can make money to send to Lokita’s family back home and to the smugglers that brought them here. These two kids are surrounded by cruelty, indifference, and suspicion, but their relationship also allows us to feel some hope. It also means that the film becomes ulcer-inducingly unbearable once things truly start to spin out of control. —B.E. This cleverly constructed comedy from Hong Sang-soo takes place entirely in a small Seoul apartment building that provides not just the setting for the movie, but its structure. Byung-soo (Hae-hyo Kwon) is an acclaimed filmmaker paying a visit to the building’s owner, an old friend named Ms. Kim (Lee Hye-young) who soon realizes he has ulterior motives. But what follows are sly episodes that take Byung-soo to each level of the building in what can be seen as glimpses of his future romantic and professional disappointments, or as forward-looking fantasies about his life as he gradually loses the status that’s key to his identity. —A.W. The romantic comedy isn’t dead, it’s strolling around South London in the company of Dom (David Jonsson) and Yas (Vivian Oparah), a pair of charming 20-somethings who end up spending the day together after a less than auspicious meet cute in the bathroom of an art gallery. Both are getting over breakups, and the joy of Raine Allen-Miller’s movie comes from the dawning realization in each, over teasing banter and some mini-adventures along the way, that they might finally be ready to open their hearts again. —A.W. Ji Huang and Ryûji Otsuka’s bleakly funny film has you aching for its 20-year-old protagonist Lynn (Honggui Yao) as much as you also feel exasperated with her naïveté. Lynn, who’s studying to be a flight attendant, seems forever a passenger in her own life, but when she finds out she’s pregnant by her self-involved boyfriend, she opts to keep the baby in a scheme to help her mother, one of the few firm decisions we see her make. In Stonewalling’s vision of a contemporary China accelerating toward dystopia, this shifts Lynn from being commodified for her beauty to being commodified for the fetus she’s carrying, navigating an increasingly absurd fertility industry that suggests her future prospects are bleak. —A.W. Guy Ritchie movies should theoretically be romps, but an overbearing fussiness threatens to kneecap many of them at every turn. Here then is something genuinely charming and light-footed: An espionage comedy-thriller in which a British superspy (Jason Statham) with a fondness for the finer things in life puts together a team to infiltrate the world of a playboy billionaire arms dealer (Hugh Grant), who just happens to be obsessed with the work of an action-movie star (Josh Hartnett), who in turn also gets roped into the elaborate scheme. With plenty of action set pieces — shootouts, car chases, and acrobatic beatdowns — you could imagine this as a dry run for a James Bond film, but the humorous banter and the cast (with especially charming turns from Hartnett and Grant) place it firmly in the realm of comedy. Everybody in Operation Fortune — yes, even Guy Ritchie — seems to be having fun. Sometimes, that’s all you need. —B.E. Cocaine Bear is, above all else, a title and a concept, and the movie clearly understands this. Elizabeth Banks’s action-comedy-thriller is loosely based on a 1985 incident when an American black bear ingested a massive amount of cocaine and was found dead soon thereafter. The film concocts a fanciful story — a series of stories, really — out of what might happen if an enormous bear went on a savage, indestructible, coke-fueled rampage through the Georgia woods. It’s part Spielbergian kids’ adventure, part slasher flick, with an ambling, gory insouciance that might have been more off-putting in a movie not called Cocaine Bear. —B.E. Colin West’s gentle sci-fi comedy-drama plays like Interstellar remade by Wes Anderson. Jim Gaffigan gives a warm, charming performance as the host of a children’s science show who loses his job and decides to build a rocket from the remains of one that has crashed in his backyard. Meanwhile, his rebellious teenage daughter begins falling for the new kid at school, who just happens to be the troubled son of the hard-ass, go-getter astronaut who replaced our hero at his job (also played by Gaffigan, now with a sinister mustache). But as the characters’ realities begin to fray, we start to sense that there’s more to this story than what we’re seeing. It’s a moving film about time, ambition, aging, wormholes, and the all-consuming power of love. And the film’s quaint, handmade qualities help make the tears it remorselessly jerks out of you feel like honest ones. —B.E. Four strangers (led by a wonderful Dave Bautista) emerge from the woods and present a family — a young girl and her two fathers (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) — with an impossible choice: They must willingly sacrifice one member in order to avert the apocalypse. The film smoothly moves from the textures of one type of thriller to another, even as the mood remains eerily consistent. A Frankenstein opening soon gives way to a home-invasion picture, then a village-cult horror movie, and finally a disaster flick. Knock at the Cabin is based on Paul Tremblay’s 2018 novel, The Cabin at the End of the World, and the script follows the book pretty closely for the first two-thirds. Both are works of the apocalyptic imagination, but Tremblay’s tale is more insular, working the ambiguity of the situation to explore the characters’ faith and emotional perseverance. Shyamalan, however, understands that there is usually little ambiguity around such horrors in cinema; in 2023, when someone in a movie says the planet is ending, it usually is. Instead, he returns to one of the animating ideas of his early work: a profound grief at the state of the world. The result is the most exhilarating and wounding film the director has made in many, many years. —B.E. Mia Hansen-Løve makes pictures that amble along with the rhythms of the everyday, about characters who never quite know what to do with themselves when they experience brief moments of happiness. She borrows odds and ends from her own life (and the lives of those around her), and reconfigures them into stories that carry the unnerving echoes of truth. In One Fine Morning, Léa Seydoux plays a widowed single mother whose philosopher father (Pascal Greggory) has been struggling with dementia. While mulling what to do with his rapidly deteriorating condition, Sandra reconnects with an old, married friend (Melvil Poupaud) and begins a heated affair. Suddenly, she finds herself deeply in need of this man’s affections — cherishing her moments with him while trying to hold off the irreparable sadness that seems to surround her. This could have easily become a torrid, tear-jerking melodrama, but Hansen-Løve’s matter-of-fact approach to performance and incident allow the emotions to emerge organically from the unfussy drama onscreen. She reminds us that beauty is often found in the mundane cadences of ordinary life. —B.E. Alice Diop’s stunner of a film tucks a whole fraught universe into a courtroom drama. Kayije Kagame plays Rama, an author and professor who attends the trial of Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanda), a woman who’s been accused of killing her own baby. Rama intends to make Laurence the subject of her next book, but instead, to her fascination and sporadic horror, sees herself in the admitted murderer, especially in their shared experiences as Senegalese immigrants and receptacles of immense parental expectations. —A.W. With his film Return to Seoul, writer-director Davy Chou grounds his story in Park Ji-min’s features and expressions. Her debut performance is so piercing it makes the entire film move like a breathing poem. Park plays Frédérique “Freddie” Benoît, a 25-year-old Korean woman adopted by a white French couple, who has returned to her ancestral home. When she visits an adoption center to find out more about her parents and realizes the organization must formally send requests to her birth mother and father, Freddie tries to remain impenetrable. But cracks in her charismatic façade become undeniable when she travels to meet her father and the family that could have been hers. There are no grand speeches, no sudden or dramatic upheavals, no twinkling score to mawkishly pull at your heartstrings. Return to Seoul carries itself with a gentle forcefulness. Where do Freddie’s wounds begin? Where does the pain of her torn identity end? It is in the grooves of Park’s beauty, the clarity of her emotion, that we come to understand Freddie’s life as a fable written upon sand. —A.J.B. It may not have won the Oscar, but Colm Bairéad’s 1980s drama about a neglected 9-year-old is a delicate marvel. Filmed entirely in Irish — a first for a Best International Film nominee — The Quiet Girl stars newcomer Catherine Clinch as the vulnerable Cáit, who’s sent away for the summer to live on a farm with distant cousin Eibhlín (Carrie Crowley) and her husband Seán (Andrew Bennett). The couple lost their own child years ago, and the film’s subdued pleasures come from the way the visit makes all three of these wounded people open up, with Cáit, pushed to the margins in her crowded home, blossoming under the attention and care she’s been craving all her life. —A.W.

"Dec 3, 2023",positive," Now available to rent and buy, both online and on physical media, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is an impressive but flawed biographical picture. While Nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film, it is actually the performances that stand out the most. Oppenheimer uses a non-linear, somewhat messy narrative to follow physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) from his university studies in 1926 Europe, through his masterminding the atomic bomb during World War II, and to its politically fraught aftermath in the 1950s. It tells his story with a large ensemble cast; it would be a nightmare remembering every character’s name, but thankfully Nolan’s screenplay ensures you do not need to remember every famous physicist in order to follow the story. What does make things needlessly complicated is Nolan’s constant shifting back and fourth between three separate timelines. While the bulk of the film follows Oppenheimer’s career during the war, another presents a rather harrowing interrogation of Oppenheimer in the 1950s. A third, presented in stark black and white (a first for the Imax film format), follows a Senate confirmation for Cabinet hopeful Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr). The use of black and white is a bold but distracting choice, and a lack of clarity in the film’s initial scenes makes it a slightly muddled ride for the first 45 minutes or so. When the action settles down, the narrative becomes clearer, and there is certainly a strong emotional payoff by the climax. No matter the thread or timeline, Oppenheimer is a film haunted by the spectre of nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer himself is increasingly haunted by the potential for destruction and abstract imagery peppers the most intense scenes with glimpses of atoms splitting and fire raging. So pervasive is the sense of dread that it powerfully undercuts any sense of achievement. When the iconic Trinity test succeeds, the gathered scientists and soldiers clap and cheer enthusiastically, yet the scene retains the miserable gut-punch of tragedy. It’s not a surprise to note Nolan is 53 years old: Oppenheimer‘s treatment of the atomic bomb blazes with “generation x” expectations of nuclear annihilations. Nowadays our expectations of Armageddon feel more closely tied to climate change or viral outbreaks. If you were not there in the early 1980s, you simply do not know what it felt like: Nolan captures it perfectly. It is great to see Cillian Murphy not only get his highest-profile lead role to date, but to see him play it with such complexity. There is an ambivalence to Murphy’s gaze, and he employs it powerfully here. He is surrounded by a broad ensemble of hugely talented artists, including Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Florence Pugh, and David Dastmalchian. Among them there are three key highlights: it is wonderful to see Robert Downey Jr fully stretch his acting talents as Strauss, a role miles away from the Iron Man films that dominated much of the past 15 years. Another unexpectedly strong performance comes from Jason Clarke (Terminator: Genisys, Pet Sematary), who captures the screen as an aggressive government prosecutor. Finally Emily Blunt does wonders in a somewhat limited role as Oppenheimer’s resentful wife Kitty. It is hard not to notice how much Oppenheimer limits and sidelines its female characters. It is partly a problem of history: make a film about a group of men building an atomic bomb and it is going to be dominated by male characters. On the other hand, including Kitty Oppenheimer opens the film to a woman’s perspective on the historical events. Nolan entertains the potential to some degree, but could easily have pushed much further. The situation is even worse for co-star Florence Pugh, who plays J. Robert’s lover Jean Tatlock – she appears terribly superficial in a role that wastes her talents. Christopher Nolan continues to have a blind spot for women in his films. All too often they are underwritten. They exist as either victims (Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight), damsels (Kat Barton in Tenet), or as emotional support for the male protagonist (Ellie Burr in Insomnia, Sarah Borden in The Prestige). I am sure many would argue that the facts of history precluded Nolan from foregrounding any women here; this ignores the fact that he gives himself the perfect set-up already – and simply fails to follow through with it. Despite its flaws, Oppenheimer is a powerful, visually impressive film. Ludwig Göransson’s musical score is masterful, as is Nolan’s use of sound. Stamping feet never felt so powerful, or so ominous."
"Dec 3, 2023",negative," In typical Christopher Nolan (Dunkirk, Inception) style, Oppenheimer fizzes with quick cuts, multiple timelines, and aesthetic flourishes accompanied by immersive sound effects. But just because there’s a lot happening on screen, with a tense soundtrack playing for three hours straight, it doesn’t mean a movie will be interesting.  The film suffers from a lack of editing, and the topic about the excesses of hubris feels like deeply trodden territory. Aside from an impressive showcase for Cillian Murphy as the titular physicist and “father of the atom bomb,” Oppenheimer amounts to more the same navel-gazing found in Nolan’s previous film, Tenet (2020)—more flash than substance. Nolan does women dirty in Oppenheimer. Florence Pugh plays Oppenheimer’s mistress, Jean Tatlock, and spends much of her screen time naked and hypersexualized before she kills herself so that the narrative can give the physicist a scene where he gets to feel bad. Emily Blunt gets shoved into a tokenized box as a shrew-like wife, shown mostly crying, yelling, throwing things, and/or all of the above. Although she gets a single “grrl power” scene, dressing down a table full of men, it’s overall a demeaning role for an actor who’s so much more than this script allows her to be. I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities—Japanese people and Native Americans—were glossed over by the script and had no voice. At most, white characters quip about the “Indians” on whose burial grounds the Manhattan Project blithely bombs to all hell; in other scenes, discussions about Japanese casualties are purposefully cold, taking place behind closed doors in rooms full of white men who discuss the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians like they’re talking about the weather.  The film has Jewish main characters, Robert J. Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), but the story is told by non-Jewish filmmaker Nolan and based on a book by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin—neither of whom are Jewish (though Bird is married to a Jewish woman).  Among lead actors, Downey Jr. has Jewish heritage but Murphy, and the actor who plays iconic Jewish physicist Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) are not. At most, Jewish actors like Alden Ehrenreich, David Krumholtz, Benny Safdie, and others appear in the film, but they play supporting and minor roles in a very large cast. All this to say, there isn’t anything inherently wrong with actors playing roles outside of their own faiths; it just doesn’t make this film a positive example of “Jewish representation,” simply because there isn’t much to speak of. "
"Dec 2, 2023",negative," A movie that might have been otherwise titled 'Fatman: The Dark Knight Rises'  - considering British director Christopher Nolan's claim to fame specializing in comic book superhero blockbusters, the least of dubious celebratory proclamations of the film was plenty of preview studio publicity announcing in effect an industrial light and magic show, bells and whistles galore to behold. Not unlike, ironically, the actual spectator sport on and originally off screen, of Oppenheimer and company's original dress rehearsal detonation in the desert, in goggles and gaping with glee.   A theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, a secret installation who mission was to develop and build the first nuclear weapons - and hence often called the 'father of the atomic bomb,' J. Robert Oppenheimer is the subject of the bloated three hour biopic Oppenheimer, currently predicted to grab assorted Oscars this year. While this analysis essentially explores the staggering contradictions of the existence itself of this production - and as a side note a film that saw the entire cast and crew walking out of the London premiere in support of the Hollywood strikes - yet had no effect on the massive publicity extravaganza celebrating the theatrical release. And on the political front, Oppenheimer who seemed to dabble in communism as a hobby, also named names under McCarthyism. Watta guy to memorialize in a movie. Then again, Hollywood would have no qualms about that, destroying so many lives and precipitating suicides under the Blacklist themselves. But at the same time, a film teeming with metaphorical possibilities, whether intentional or not. For instance, early on a scene with Oppenheimer as a student, injecting an apple on his despised science teacher's desk, with a smuggled toxic lab chemical there.  And in that sense, giving rise to theatrical intimations of the biblical Genesis - with Oppenheimer as simultaneously Original sins combo serpent and the first man - in this case banished from the Garden Of Eden whether as creator of the first bomb potentially obliterating humankind, or the destruction of the hope of Eden, hypothetically the rise of socialism back then, a potential utopia he contributed to destroying by naming names - or perhaps both. And speaking of which, a distracting and exhausting focus on the anti-communist McCarthy Hearings, seemingly in excruciating real time for a huge portion of the proceedings that could have benefited enormously from cutting room floor considerations - while somehow giving rise to a dubious new genre, C-Span Cinema. Never has the Red Scare come off as this exceedingly dull.  On the other hand, what would a biopic about a flawed formidable man be, without bad mothers like his wife, the usual historical witch personas, and in this case, femme fatales. In a nutshell, Oppenheimer in the real world visited his old lover on the sly, depicted during much promoted online nude romp scenes, away from his wife. Who in turn left her husband for Oppenheimer, divorcing her spouse after Oppenheimer knocks her up. And, Oppenheimer's bad behavior culminating in lover number one's suicide. But never mind, this movie is presumably all about Oppenheimer's bombs, with bombshells secondary.  And ironically, Oppenheimer himself who relished playing it both ways - basking in the glory of his atomic claim to fame while denouncing the bomb, naming names of presumed political comrades, and concealing his women from one another, - could very likely as an alleged communist have denounced the film released during the Hollywood strikes - while simultaneously basking in the attention the film has bestowed upon him."
"Nov 28, 2023",positive," Oppenheimer (now streaming on Peacock, in addition to VOD services like Amazon Prime Video) is an anomaly: A “prestige”/“auteur-driven” not-a-movie-but-a-Film that was a wild box office success. Christopher Nolan’s inventive bio of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” raked in $950 million worldwide in spite of being a talky three-hour drama that features only one explosion, but hey, that boom is a really, really big one. One wonders if the film would’ve been such a mighty financial success without the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, which inspired people to flock to theaters for a Barbie/Oppenheimer cognitive-dissonance double-feature – or without the megahyped IMAX 70mm release, which amplified Nolan’s inspired visual presentation, the likes of which lesser directors would probably never consider applying to a historical biopic about a quantum-physics genius. Another component of the anomaly? This mega-big-screen Film works pretty damn well at home on our TVs, too.  The Gist: The first two images we see in Oppenheimer are rain and fire. Appropriately, the third is of Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy), who embodies both. Not too long after this, once Nolan shifts from black and white to color, switches aspect ratios and establishes a few plot strands set in different decades – once Nolan does his Nolan thing, you might say – Oppenheimer sits down a university student to discuss how light functions as both wave and particle. “It’s paradoxical – and yet, it works,” Oppenheimer says, which is also a remarkably pithy, on-point description of the man himself. In the moments between these scenes, we see Oppenheimer as a young man and brilliant student in the mid-1920s; we meet Lewis Strauss in 1959 (Robert Downey Jr.) as he’s on the cusp of his Senate confirmation to President Eisenhower’s cabinet; we watch as Oppenheimer is subject to an antagonistic 1954 hearing over whether his government security clearance should be reinstated; and we see Strauss offer Oppenheimer a job, then get miffed when he believes Oppenheimer spoke poorly of him to Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). Cut into all of this are nearly abstract shots of lights, sparks, flares and stars. Oppenheimer is about to start a fire that no amount of rain will ever put out. These myriad plotlines eventually almost settle down a little as Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) lures Oppenheimer away from his gig teaching quantum physics, and they get to the business of developing the atom bomb. Hitler’s cutting through Europe, and the Allies worry that he’s developing his own weapon of mass destruction; it’s Oppenheimer’s job to beat the Fuhrer to the punch. Groves enables him to build an entire town, dubbed Los Alamos, in the middle of the New Mexico desert where all the scientists and technicians can bring their families and dedicate all their time to the effort. Meanwhile, we flash back to how Oppenheimer met his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), who struggles with depression and alcoholism, as well as how he met Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his mistress (being with two partners at once is applying quantum mechanics to love, you know). The two women share one thing in common: membership in the U.S. Communist Party, and Oppenheimer’s fringe interest in such far-left politics will dog him for decades. To be fair, he seems more like a noncommittal sort when it comes to politics and women, more driven by an intellectual curiosity that rejects binary ideas. Case in point: Is the atomic bomb good or bad? A deterrent or an accelerant? The weapon to end all war or inspire more war? Oppenheimer wrestles with the paradox, but can’t pin it to the mat. All the narratives roll forward: Oppenheimer’s hearing gets heated. Strauss’ confirmation gets heated, too. And as the Los Alamos project progresses, Oppenheimer and co. stare down the likelihood of the bomb creating a chain reaction that’ll set the atmosphere aflame, destroying the entire planet. What are the chances? “Near zero” is the answer, but that’s not zero, and perhaps it goes without saying that everyone would feel a lot better if it was zero; as history dictates, they soldier on anyway. Dozens of characters exchange dialogue with Murphy-as-Oppenheimer, and they’re played by Josh Hartnett, Dane DeHaan, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, Alden Ehrenreich, Macon Blair, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, Olivia Thirlby and Gary Oldman as Harry Truman. Some of these characters feel the reverberations of that infamous bomb test in the New Mexico desert more than others, but it’s safe to say Oppenheimer felt them the most.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: They’re two wildly different artists, I know, but Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City are both piercing and complex explorations of atomic-age existentialism.  Performance Worth Watching: Oldman blatantly steals his only scene; between this and Fair Play, Ehrenreich has reasserted himself after facing some (not entirely deserving!) criticism for Solo: A Star Wars Story; Pugh makes the absolute most of her limited screen time; Murphy is never anything less than fully committed; and is that Josh Hartnett, yes indeed that’s Josh Hartnett! But the performance we’ll carry with us the longest is Downey’s, whose memorably acerbic role as this story’s greasy-politics villain will likely make him an Oscar frontrunner. Our Take: As depicted here, Oppenheimer is not at all a Man of Certainty, which, in the mid-century context, makes him not much of a man at all. Real men are decisive and stick to their guns and double down and never, ever change their minds. You know the type. But those hombres anchor genre movies (Westerns, action flicks) and aren’t the subjects of complicated 180-minute biodramas that build and build and build and build to a nuclear explosion that’s so non-climactic, it’s followed by another entire hour of movie. Not that the kaboom isn’t memorable; it’s intense and awe-inspiring, rattling body and mind with its physicality and implications, and it’s the only thing that shakes Oppenheimer from his habit of being ideologically evasive. Murphy is extraordinary at carrying this man’s multitudes: His take on Oppenheimer is that of a brilliant scientist who’s gifted at inspiring other bright minds to build upon his ideas, a man committed to telling the truth no matter what, and a deeply flawed human being. In Murphy’s performance you sense the struggle within Oppenheimer to tamp down emotions outside of his enthusiasm for pure scientific pursuits, but when politics muddy those pursuits, the emotion swells, cracking his facade. Is he a communist? Yes and no. Does he like being a husband and family man? Yes and no. Does he think the atomic bomb is the granddaddy of all ideological cans of worms? Yes, of course he does, and his attempt to compartmentalize his work in the lab from real-world implications is surely his greatest failure. Believe it or not, Nolan’s storytelling here is crisp and economic, the narrative moving urgently thanks to Jennifer Lame’s brisk editing. Oppenheimer is as propulsive as dialogue-driven habitually time-hopping three-hour character studies get, an uneasy score and on-edge performances generating simmering tension up to and through the big detonation, and the subsequent fallout when Oppenheimer tries to split the hairs of fame and infamy, of guilt and righteousness. Nolan’s loop-de-looping screenplay mirrors the ethical curlicues Oppenheimer navigates throughout, and is packed with dialogue that feels elevated and pragmatic, dozens of sloganeering lines laced with double meanings at the service of a procedural underscored with the terrifying moral dilemmas of the Cold War and struggle existential metaphors involving black holes, dying stars, shattered atoms and things we struggle to comprehend and don’t want to think about. Sure, we might chuckle when Matt Damon all-caps bellows, “THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT F—ING THING IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!” but we can’t argue that it’s not justified. Oppenheimer gives us perhaps the year’s most horrifying sequence when the protagonist gives an unconvincing jingoistic speech to Los Alamos residents, and from his point of view, it’s a surrealistic nightmare, a booze-soaked quasi-religious scene of screaming, crying, laughing rapture. People stomp and clap and chant his name, for he’s the man who ended the war by inventing the bomb that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The chain reaction has started, and it feels like the beginning of the end. It’s the only time we see him speak a lie.  Our Call: STREAM IT. Oppenheimer is an ambitious film (one of the most ambitious ever) about an ambitious project (also one of the most ambitious ever, for better or worse). Nolan blows up the traditional biopic and rebuilds it in thrilling, dynamic fashion."
"Nov 27, 2023",positive," J. Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical Physicist who was the Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Lab during World War II.  He is also often referred to as the Father of the Atomic Bomb for his work on the project - a fact he often struggled with later in his lifetime. His work, beliefs, and relationships have always been a subject of discussion and this past summer director Christopher Nolan (Tenet) brought a three-hour epic drama to theaters.  Oppenheimer, the second biggest grossing film of the summer behind Barbie, made close to a billion dollars worldwide, is now in stores for purchase on 4K UHD. Cillian Murphy (Red Eye), portrays the scientist with an air of serious conviction.  He is very well cast as he embodies the calm yet determined nature of Oppenheimer. While he isn't physically a match for Oppenheimer he manages well enough for the purposes of this drama. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), as his wife, Kitty, is a solid choice as she goes through a range of emotions.  Matt Damon (The Martian), who can be hit or miss with his choices of film roles, does a good job as General Leslie Groves, the US Army Corps of Engineers Officer who oversees The Manhattan Project.  Supporting cast members including Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Jason Clarke (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story), Tony Goldwyn (Scandal), Kenneth Branagh (Much Ado About Nothing) and Florence Pugh (Black Widow) give Oppenheimer an added level of credibility as they are all adeptly skilled in the craft of acting. The 2160p video quality is outstanding with details so sharp that one can see the threads on the suits that Murphy and other cast members wear.  The visual effects of ""the explosion"" are perfect and don't look unnatural at all. Every detail offers clean lines and brilliant colors - as much as color can play a role in desert scenes.  The lush hues of California's greenery are deep and true and give the film some depth. The surprise with this release is that the audio is only presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 instead of Dolby Atmos.  While the 5.1 version is top-notch, one can't help but wonder if the quality would not have been enhanced by the latest technology.  Perhaps, the variation was so minute that Universal Pictures felt it was an unnecessary upgrade.  Regardless, the sound, from dialogue to effects and even the score, is stunning.  It doesn't feel as though anything is missing by not presenting the movie in Atmos. Plus Trailers, Innovations in Film: 65mm Black-And-White Film in Oppenheimer, Meet The Press Q&A Panel: Oppenheimer, and To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb.  Oppenheimer is arguably one of the best films of the year, and it wouldn't be surprising if it didn't get at least a few Oscar nominations. Whether or not you have already seen it, you will want to add it to your home entertainment collection, and this combo pack is the way to go as it has superior technical quality and a plethora of interesting extras that are worth watching more than once.

"Nov 25, 2023",positive," THE EQUALIZER 3-MOVIE COLLECTION (2014-2023). Running for four seasons (1985-1989), TV’s The Equalizer found British actor Edward Woodward (The Wicker Man, recently reviewed here) essaying the role of Robert McCall, a former government operative employing his impressive skills to help out those too weak and powerless to fight back. In the same-named film The Equalizer (2014), Robert McCall has been reborn in the personage of Denzel Washington, who similarly brings enormous reserves of brains, brawn, and bravado to the part. Making small talk with another regular customer at his favorite diner, a too-young call girl named Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), McCall can easily surmise that her vocation isn’t exactly what this Russian immigrant had in mind for herself — that becomes even more clear after she’s brutally beaten by Russian thugs who control her very existence. Realizing he can no longer stand idly by, McCall taps into his long-buried past to help him with this present situation. The Equalizer is about as subtle as a pneumatic stapler shot to the temple, with McCall worthy of sainthood and the villains worthy of being Satan’s emissaries on Earth. But who wants subtlety when one can bask in the glory of Denzel obliterating remorseless degenerates left and right? Like the original (and only decent) entry in Liam Neeson’s Taken series, this isn’t a film for those seeking moral ambiguity or thought-provoking shades of gray. It’s cinema as catharsis, allowing ordinary people weary of living in a world run by vile criminals and corrupt cops the fantasy of seeing a sentient superman righting all wrongs on their behalf. Pimps and other like-minded creeps who prey on women — whether murdering them, torturing them, controlling them (anti-choice, anyone?) or grabbing them by the, ahem — represent just about the worst that humanity has to offer, so when McCall deals with them in violent fashion, progressive viewers just might cheer out loud. As noted, watching Denzel’s former CIA operative deal with all manner of evildoers over the course of The Equalizer is a cathartic experience, but the movie also works because of its kinetic action scenes as well as a gradual reveal of the layers of Washington’s character. The Equalizer 2 (2018) offers no such pleasures. This is a particularly dreary film, one which makes no attempt to freshen up or even disguise its rote storyline. As in many an unimaginative sequel, This Time It’s Personal™, meaning that McCall’s CIA pal Susan (Melissa Leo) gets killed once she gets too close to the truth regarding a faked murder/suicide — that truth is so fleetingly and haphazardly explained that it scarcely matters, and Susan might as well have been slain for trying to steal a neighbor’s cherished pie recipe. A subplot involving McCall’s mentoring relationship with a young kid (Ashton Sanders) seems to have been imported from a lesser ABC Afterschool Special from the 1970s. And while The Equalizer was excessively brutal because the plot demanded it, The Equalizer 2 is excessively brutal because the filmmakers demanded it. It all culminates with a lengthy battle royale in which McCall faces down the baddies while a storm rages all around them. It’s laughably absurd, and just one more reason why The Equalizer 2, despite typically strong work from Washington, is less than the sum of its slickly oiled parts. As heavily reported at the time of its release, The Equalizer 2 was the first sequel Denzel ever made, a mind-blowing fact considering the number of actors only too happy to remain aboard any given gravy train. With The Equalizer 3 (2023), we now get only the second follow-up Denzel has ever made. Clearly, the superstar has great affinity for the character of Robert McCall, and it shows in this picture’s plot. Whereas the heroes in other action flicks find themselves trapped in a neverending series of carbon-copy adventures or only slow down and sleep when they’re dead, McCall is one of the very few who has a legitimate chance at a Happily Ever After retirement from bloodletting. When his latest do-gooder deed takes him to Italy, he ends up recuperating from a particularly nasty injury in a quiet coastal town where everyone seemingly knows everyone else. McCall responds positively to the region and its people, and he considers making the town his permanent home — first, though, he must rid the area of a Mafia-like outfit whose members are into drug-running, murder, and general sneering. With a more focused storyline and a greater emphasis on character, The Equalizer 3 is a definite improvement over the previous picture. It also benefits from the clever casting of Dakota Fanning, here playing acerbic CIA agent Emma Collins. Fanning was all of 10 when she previously co-starred with Washington in 2004’s Man on Fire; she’s now 29, and it’s trippy seeing this former moppet squaring off against Denzel and playing an adult who gives as good as she gets. No points, though, for figuring out how Emma is connected to McCall’s past, as the big reveal turns out to be no big deal with its utter predictability. This new Blu-ray collection is being released alongside standalone editions of The Equalizer 3. The E3 4K and Blu extras include deleted scenes; a look at the reunion between Washington and Fanning; and the lyric video for Jacob Banks’ “Monster.” THE FUGITIVE (1993). Movies based on prime-time television series have long tended to be sorry excuses for cinematic enshrinement (The Dukes of Hazzard, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Honeymooners, about 1,000 more), but The Fugitive remains one of the very best examples of the exception to that rule. Both a critical and commercial smash when it hit theaters 30 years ago, this adaptation of the classic TV show (1963-1967) stars Harrison Ford as Richard Kimble, a Chicago doctor whose wife (Sela Ward) is murdered by a one-armed man for unknown reasons. With no evidence, though, the police finger Kimble as the killer, and he’s quickly arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. But after a spectacular train-and-bus collision sets him free, he searches for the murderer himself — he’s pursued every step of the way by U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), who cares far more about catching his man than wondering whether said man is guilty or innocent. Directed for maximum impact by Andrew Davis from a sharp script by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, this contains enough suspenseful set-pieces, clever red herrings, and spectacular stuntwork to satisfy most thriller aficionados. Yet what really makes the movie work are the performances by the two leads. Ford is believable as the tormented hero — indeed, a key ingredient to the film’s success is how firmly he commands audience sympathy — while Jones is out-and-out terrific as the arrogant, never-say-quit lawman. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this earned Jones the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Extras in the 4K UHD + Digital Code edition consist of audio commentary by Davis and Jones; an introduction by Davis and Ford; a pair of making-of featurettes; a breakdown of the train wreck sequence; and the theatrical trailer. IN LOVE AND WAR (1996). All’s poor in In Love and War, a major miscalculation with two flailing stars under the tutelage of a dull director. Richard Attenborough, a decent actor who began performing in 1942 but only took up directing in 1969, has long maintained a reputation in many (non-BAFTA) circles as a stodgy helmer. While his attention to plodding detail worked quite well for 1982’s Gandhi (his best film, and the one that earned him a Best Director Oscar), it muted other pictures that might have benefitted from a more robust style, such as A Chorus Line and A Bridge Too Far. (Attenborough’s most popular roles included Squadron Leader Bartlett in The Great Escape and John Hammond in Jurassic Park, and we should give thanks that he acted in, rather than directed, those thrill-a-minute classics. But I digress.) The 113-minute In Love and War takes what should have been a moving love story — the fact-based dalliance between a 19-year-old Ernest Hemingway and a 26-year-old nurse — and makes it about as emotionally involving as a 180-minute documentary on aglet production. Chris O’Donnell plays Hemingway as a cocky yet sweet kid whose boundless energy results in a serious leg injury during a World War I skirmish. This places him in the care of Agnes von Kurowsky (Sandra Bullock), and it was the earnest Ernest’s doomed romance with her that arguably transformed him into the macho, womanizing he-man known to all and inarguably informed some of his writing (the character of Catherine Barkley in A Farewell to Arms was based on her). Watching the bland O’Donnell attempt to convey soulful anguish is a sight in itself, while a sluggish Bullock seems distracted throughout, perhaps reflecting on whether it was a mistake to agree to star in the upcoming Speed 2: Cruise Control. (Answer: It was.) OPPENHEIMER (2023). It was quite gratifying to see that both halves of the Barbenheimer phenomenon lived up to the hype, with the social frenzy so ear-piercingly loud that it probably belonged in an IMAX production directed by Christopher Nolan. While Greta Gerwig’s Barbie (recently reviewed here) offers sunshine and rainbow colors to go with its satiric and social themes, Nolan’s Oppenheimer presents a suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues. One of the best films of the year thus far, this finds Nolan regular Cillian Murphy moving from supporting player to leading man for the helmer — he delivers a superb performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist whose work on the Manhattan Project led to the creation of the atom bomb. A three-hour motion picture that never wears out its welcome, the film, written and directed by Nolan and adapted from the biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, covers a startling amount of ground, examining not only Oppenheimer’s years on the assignment but also his relationships with his strong-willed wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and his troubled mistress Jean Tatlock (an excellent Florence Pugh), his crippling guilt over the hundreds of thousands killed in Japan toward the close of World War II, and the post-war circumstances that damaged his career. Oppenheimer features an all-star cast, but the picture isn’t merely collecting A-listers as if they were baseball cards — from Matt Damon as the supportive General Groves to Robert Downey Jr. as the shifty Atomic Energy Commission head Lewis Strauss, most of the major roles help round out Oppenheimer’s story, and even the smaller parts (tackled by Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, and Gary Oldman, among others) lend import and understanding to the proceedings. Extras in the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Code edition include a making-of featurette; a Q&A panel chat; and a piece on the atomic bomb. THE POLICE ACADEMY COLLECTION (1984-1994). What, pray tell, might rightly be considered the worst movie franchise (minimum four films) in Hollywood history? While my personal vote would be neatly sliced down the middle with each half given to the Transformers and Friday the 13th series, it’s hard to argue against the folks who would insist it was this inane comedy franchise that dominated much of the 1980s (with one straggler appearing in the ‘90s). That there was a total of seven of these things — not to mention a live-action television series, an animated TV show, a comic book, and even a global theme park attraction — boggles the mind; it would be easy to chalk it up to the ofttimes dubious taste of the American public (see also: Grown Ups, The Apprentice, anything to do with the Kardashians) except that these pictures were even more popular overseas. Police Academy (1984) certainly demonstrated why there was at least one sequel, as the first picture in the series was one of the top 10 grossers of 1984 (thereby rubbing shoulders with genuinely funny flicks like Beverly Hills Cop, Ghostbusters, and Romancing the Stone). A mandate by the mayor states that the metropolitan police department must accept all applicants regardless of age, weight, IQ, etc. Thus we get the usual assemblage of slobs, misfits, and underachievers, including the affable Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg, desperately trying to channel an inner Bill Murray that doesn’t exist), the towering Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), the wacky Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), the gun-crazy Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), the bold and busty Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), the mousy Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), and the bumbling Douglas Fackler (Bruce Mahler). All are under the not-so-watchful eye of the easily befuddled academy head, Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes), with the devious Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey, the poor man’s Herbert Lom/Chief Inspector Dreyfus from The Pink Panther series) serving as a constant foil. The movie isn’t really much funnier than its sorry sequels, but it’s the best of the bunch simply by virtue of being fresh (or as fresh as this moldy premise can get) and by introducing Winslow’s amazing, self-produced sound effects to the general population. Practically every picture in the series showcased a pretty woman to serve as a one-and-done opposite Guttenberg (or his equally blasé replacements in the later entries) — here, it’s Kim Cattrall as the shapely cadet who can’t resist Mahoney’s obnoxious ways. The original Police Academy was the only movie in the series to earn an R rating (for nudity and profanity, natch) — Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985) was PG-13, while the subsequent five flicks all garnered benign PG ratings. This one finds the former cadets (now graduates) assigned to police the most dangerous part of town. Easterbrook is MIA, Bailey has been replaced as the fumbling foil by Art Metrano as Lieutenant Mauser, and Colleen Camp’s Kathleen Kirkland is introduced as a love interest for Tackleberry. But never mind all that: The real story is the arrival of Bobcat Goldthwait to the series, playing a gang leader named Zed McGlunk. Anyone familiar with ‘80s lowbrow humor is familiar with Goldthwait, who typically played twitchy, stuttering goofballs. He’s fascinating to behold, although whether that’s a positive or a negative is up to each individual viewer. At #11, this barely missed out on making the year’s Top 10 grossers list, pushed out by the year-end Chevy Chase-Dan Aykroyd comedy Spies Like Us. Police Academy 3: Back in Training (1986) finds the gang returning to the titular institute to help Lassard prevent its probable closing. Easterbrook reappears (thus reuniting the first picture’s not-so-magnificent seven), Metrano remains, Goldthwait’s Zed is now one of the good guys as a new cadet, and Guttenberg’s plaything this time around is a comely cadet played by 1980 Miss South Carolina / Miss USA / Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly. As in all the other films, the majority of the jokes (whether visual or verbal) don’t even bother with a payoff, which is an odd way to approach comedy. It’s also the only film series in which the characters somehow manage to become even less developed with each passing entry. Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987) is pretty self-explanatory, with the regulars joined in their efforts to rid the city of crime by ordinary citizens recruited to be ersatz cops. Bailey returns as the sneaky Lieutenant Harris, and the supporting cast has more recognizable names than usual: Sharon Stone as Mahoney’s latest conquest, David Spade in his film debut, Randall “Tex” Cobb as a heavy, and an 18-year-old Tony Hawk among the skateboarders making cameo appearances. It’s the same-old same-old, only somehow slightly worse. Police Academy 4 marked Guttenberg’s last series appearance, and with his departure, the filmmakers introduced a boring new vanilla character to replace him in Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach (1988). That would be Lassard’s nephew Nick (Matt McCoy), and this entry’s sweetheart du jour is an officer trained in physical combat (Janet Jones, who became Wayne Gretsky’s wife in the same year she made this). Goldthwait also bailed on the series after PA4, leaving René Auberjonois to attempt to add some semblance of laughs as an excitable jewel thief. One of the series’ worst characters, Harris’ brain-dead assistant Carl Proctor (Lance Kinsey), was introduced back in Part Deux; the filmmakers somehow thought it was a good idea to increase his role with each passing picture, so this one goes all-out with his imbecilic antics. With Police Academy 6: City Under Siege (1989), the series decided to skip bottom-of-the-barrel status and immediately burrow beneath the barrel. This dreadful entry finds the gang unearthing a leak inside their inner circle, one that is allowing a gang of criminals to successfully pull off a series of heists. It’s mildly amusing watching Winslow pretend to be a robot, and, uh, that’s about it for the film’s semi-successful comedy quotient. Extras in the Blu-ray collection include audio commentary on Police Academy by Guttenberg, Winslow, Easterbrook , director Hugh Wilson, and producer Paul Maslansky; film historian audio commentary on Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol; new and archival making-of featurettes; and additional scenes. THE SCARLET LETTER (1934). Given its lofty literary status, it’s perhaps surprising that there haven’t been more film adaptations of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter. The vast majority have been silent films, all largely forgotten save for the 1926 favorite starring Lillian Gish. As for sound versions, there have been three, with the most (in)famous being the 1995 debacle in which Demi Moore was so unconvincing as Hester Prynne that they might as well have cast Roger Moore or Dudley Moore in the part (this was also the one containing the risible scene of Robert Duvall dancing around a campfire with a dead deer balanced on his head). There was a 1973 German take directed by Wim Wenders, and then there’s this 1934 adaptation. The film begins with a written foreword that’s less Hawthorne and more Hollywood Production Code, reading in part, “Though to us, the [Puritan] customs seem grim and the punishments hard, they were a necessity of the times and helped shape the destiny of a nation.” In 17th century Boston, Hester Prynne (Colleen Moore) is forced to wear the letter “A” on her garments for committing adultery and conceiving a child out of wedlock. She refuses to name the father, who turns out to be minister Arthur Dimmesdale (Hardie Albright); meanwhile, Hester’s husband (Henry B. Walthall, who also played the part in the Lillian Gish version) returns after a lengthy absence and is determined to discover the dad’s identity. Often static and burdened with incongruous comic relief, this remains watchable due largely to its relative faithfulness to Hawthorne’s potent source material. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by professor Jason A. Ney, with contributions by Cora Sue Collins (who played little Pearl in the picture and is still with us at the age of 96); a look at Nathaniel Hawthorne on film; and the trailer from a 1965 re-release. STALAG 17 (1953). It’s easy to see why this World War II yarn from Billy Wilder (who earned a Best Director Oscar nomination for his efforts) was a resounding success upon its release. Different than most of the more baldly jingoistic WWII flicks that had preceded it, it combined hard-biting drama and broad humor in a manner not usually seen in war flicks of the period. Today, the drama survives intact but the humor proves to be a serious drag. Set in a POW camp, the film stars William Holden as Sefton, whose self-serving actions alienate him from the other American soldiers held in the same barracks. When it becomes apparent that there’s a German spy among the POWs in Stalag 17, all suspicion falls on Sefton, who’s forced to out the enemy informant before the other GIs turn vigilante on him. Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his unsentimental turn as the S.O.B. P.O.W., but while he’s typically solid in the role, it’s shocking to note how little screen time he ultimately commands. Instead, Stalag 17 functions as an ensemble piece, which is fine when it focuses on the taut dramatic aspects of the tale but detrimental when it breaks the mood by centering on the slapstick antics of two buffoonish soldiers played by Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck. Strauss’ incessant mugging as Animal inexplicably earned him an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, yet I suspect his role is even larger than that of top-billed Holden. Extras on the 4K UHD + Blu-ray edition include audio commentary by supporting actors Richard Erdman and Gil Stratton and playwright Donald Bevan (who co-wrote the original stage show on which the film is based); audio commentary by film historian Steve Mitchell and author Steven Jay Rubin (Combat Films: American Realism); a making-of piece; and a look at the real prisoners of Stalag XVII B."
"Nov 21, 2023",positive," There are very few directors working today whose new project getting released would be considered a major event. There's the beloved Martin Scorsese, and the ever-popular Quentin Tarantino, but there is perhaps none bigger, or more ambitious, than the great Christopher Nolan. Whether he's giving us a wondrous original creation, or adapting material in only a way that he can, his projects bring with them a grand sense of anticipation that have you excited & eager to see what new visions he'll bring to the screen. For his latest opus, he's chosen to tackle something we've yet to see him do: a biopic. However, this is not just any biopic. It's a portrait of an immensely complicated man who helped to shape the second half of the 20th century, J. Robert Oppenheimer, known to the world as ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb."" ""Oppenheimer"" is told primarily in three different time periods. Chronologically, we have one thread starting in 1926, following Robert (Cillian Murphy) in his early days as he studies at Cambridge, before taking some advice from Dr. Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) to continue in Germany instead. He eventually begins teaching at Berkeley, where he is recruited by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) for The Manhattan Project in 1942, a top secret operation to create a nuclear weapon before the Nazis.  Another thread involves a hearing in 1954 regarding Robert's security clearance, which has been questioned due to his past activities with communism. Finally, a third thread in 1959 follows a senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a former colleague of Robert's on the Atomic Energy Commission. Their relationship is closely examined, with certain truths & motivations eventually coming to light. The film cuts back and forth among the three times in an effort to give us some understanding of this very misunderstood individual. As the film opens, you may find yourself a bit disoriented at first as it shifts through and establishes the different threads. It takes a minute to grasp what is happening and when before it settles down to tell you Oppenheimer's story from the beginning. As it does, you may find yourself becoming a little concerned, as I was on my first viewing, that it's moving just a little slow as it explores Robert's early days of studying, his relationship with his eventual wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), his affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and his eventual settling at Berkeley. However, all this is merely a prelude leading up to where the film truly takes off. That, of course, is when Robert is recruited to The Manhattan Project. From here, Nolan fully immerses us in the project, showing us how everything came together, including the recruitment of scientists, the building of Los Alamos, the hard work and determination that went into designing the weapon, the many tests, and the eventual detonation of the real deal. This section, detailing the multitude of complications along the way, is compelling & fascinating on its own, but Nolan wasn't about to stop there. The film also becomes a remarkable dissection of how Oppenheimer dealt with the aftermath, primarily the overwhelming guilt that led him to speak out against the H-bomb, a subsequent project that many people wanted to pursue. And as if that wasn't enough, Nolan goes even further to turn the film into a captivating courtroom drama of sorts as Oppenheimer's character is called into question during his private hearing for his security clearance, a hearing in which his past communist affiliations, opinions, and actions are dredged up and used to viciously attack him. All of this is intertwined with Strauss' confirmation hearing, in which his part in the story is slowly unraveled. Nolan's three-hour epic may start a little slowly, but make no mistake, once it passes the aforementioned prelude, it hits the gas and never lets up. This is one of those projects where you really have to marvel at the cast Nolan was able to assemble. Not only do you have a wonderful turn from Cillian Murphy, who hits every note perfectly with his performance, and Robert Downey Jr. quite possibly delivering the performance of his career, but you also get incredible work from Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Sir Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, Casey Affleck, and more. This is truly an ensemble piece, and every piece here fits just right. This being a Christopher Nolan film, the stunning technical & design work also needs to be mentioned. Every element is handled with perfection, including Jennifer Lame's editing, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography, Ludwig Göransson's score, the visual effects, sound, and production design. This is all on top of Nolan's outstanding direction, which flawlessly brings all of these components together into an unforgettable experience. Finally, Nolan's screenplay, adapted from ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, must have its due. This is a very intricately-written tale that skillfully weaves together three different periods, shifting just when it needs to, revealing details at just the right time, and brilliantly turning this into so much more than just another by-the-numbers biopic. Anyone could have delivered a straightforward film about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, but it takes someone of Nolan's caliber to go beyond that and truly dive into the man to give us a more intimate portrait, one that attempts to convey the immense impact all of these events had on him. With ""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan accomplishes that to a dazzling degree, resulting in not just one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his career. ""Oppenheimer"" comes to Blu-ray in a 2.20:1 (1.78:1 for IMAX scenes), 1080p High Definition transfer of marvelous quality. The image is brilliantly sharp throughout, perfectly preserving all of the hard work that went into its incredible visuals. Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is outstanding, giving you all of the dialogue, sound effects, and Ludwig Göransson's score in excellent quality. Overall, you simply couldn't ask for better quality for such an extraordinary epic. The film comes with over three hours of fantastic extensive extras. The incredible ""Making of,"" told in seven chapters, is particularly worth checking out, while the ""To End All War"" documentary is great for those wanting to delve more into the man himself. With its brilliant screenplay skillfully weaving together three different periods, an exceptional ensemble, stunning technical & design elements, and magnificent direction bringing it all together, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career."
"Nov 20, 2023",positive," 
	Christopher Nolan has expended an enormous amount of creative energy serving as director, producer, and writer of this engrossing biopicture about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant American theoretical physicist who oversaw the secret Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop an atomic bomb. This bold, intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted thriller is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.
 
	As if taking off from that line, Nolan has structured his film around two heart-breaking incidents in Oppenheimer’s life. First and foremost, of course, is his role in the development of the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and three days later on Nagasaki.
 
	The second incident is a secret hearing held in 1954 to determine whether to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Supposedly, it was to investigate Oppenheimer’s ties with known Communists early in his career and with suspected disloyal scientists at Los Alamos. But the investigators were also concerned about his outspoken statements against the hydrogen bomb (yet to be developed), his advocacy of arms control and against nuclear proliferation, and his concerns about the arms race during the Cold War with Russia. How could the “father of the bomb” end up opposed to it?
 
	Nolan has chosen to film the scenes of the hearing in black-and-white (as if such confrontations could ever be that simple). Through Oppenheimer’s own and others’ testimonies, we learn of his studies at Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Gottingen in Germany, and his later position as lead physicist at Berkeley. We see him interacting with his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) and his girlfriend Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), both members of the Community Party. His wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) also had Communist ties, though she affirms that her husband had never joined the party.
 
	In flashbacks to key moments of his career, we see Oppenheimer interacting with scientists Niles Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). We observe his relationship with General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the government watchdog over the three-year, $2 billion Manhattan Project. We also see the development of a rivalry with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) who was instrumental in pushing for the security hearing.
 
	Throughout the film, Cillian Murphy seems to literally embody the mental genius and pained emotional and ethical presence of the pioneering physicist and persecuted anti-nuclear activist. His amazing performance sweeps across 40 years of academic competition, political chicanery, courtroom drama, espionage, right-wing paranoia, antisemitism, technological advance, and ethical debate.

"Nov 19, 2023",positive," Heavy is the head…with great power comes… and many other turns of phrase have been conjured up over the years to distill the consequences of wisdom and knowledge. Aside from that of Jesus, no story is more universal in Western culture than the myth of Prometheus. The god who is purported not only to have carved out man from the clay of earth but to have stolen fire from the gods and brought it to mankind forever changing us. Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is a distillation of the perennial truths such phrases reference and the myth of Prometheus channeled into one of the most important men of the 20th century, J. Robert Oppenheimer for whom the film is named. Frequent Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer with tenderness, nuance, and a fun unapologetic aloofness. Too many noteworthy faces appear beside him to list them all but a few standouts are: Emily Blunt as Kitty his wife, Matt Damon as a military general, and David Krumholtz as his friend and peer Isidor Isaac. The picture alternates between two events years after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: a backroom kangaroo court in which Macon Blair’s Lloyd Garrison guides Oppenheimer through a sham hearing; and a separate senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (performed with great care by Robert Downey Jr.). In the course of these two hearings, witnesses made up mainly of scientists and military men are brought in to recall events and answer questions.  The two hearings are labeled “Fission” and “Fusion” respectively, and within them the series of flashbacks that make up the meat of the film occur, driving the story forward and in a way mirroring the principal of waves. Ludwig Göransson’s deft use of sound queues viewers in casually to the alternations between the structure of the various complex beats Nolan and editor Lame built. With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous."

"Oct 25, 2023",positive," The filmmaker’s upcoming biopic, ‘Oppenheimer’ is about the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” is particularly relevant in a world that’s in the midst of war. Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ is an adaptation of the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, written by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The trailers for Nolan’s movie have already been published, revealing its breath-taking graphics and equally impressive cast, along with inventive vision of the director. Being focused on Cillian Murphy, who plays the title character, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the film’s impressively assembled ensemble also includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie and Robert Downey Jr. According to USA Today Christopher Nolan’s historical thriller Oppenheimer, has been called the most important story of our time. Written and directed by Nolan, Oppenheimer will be in theatres July 21and it chronicles the 1940s origins of the atomic bomb and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer’s work with fellow scientists as part of the Manhattan Project. A new video featurette (debuting exclusively at usatoday.com) reveals fresh footage plus digs into the film’s plot, use of practical effects and real locations (such as the campus of Princeton University and Oppenheimer’s house in New Mexico), and the A-list cast Nolan has assembled to tell his story. Based on the biography called American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the movie traces the life and times of the titular nuclear physicist who is referred to as the “father of atomic bomb” for his contribution to the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of first nuclear weapon. This is the first project by Nolan in more than two decades that does not involve Warner Bros, the studio with which he had a falling out over the release strategy of his last pic, the science-fiction action-thriller ‘Tenet’. ‘Oppenheimer’ has both been written and directed by Nolan, which is not unusual for him. Hoyte van Hoytema, who Nolan also collaborated on ‘Interstellar’ and ‘Dunkirk’, will handle the camera. Jennifer Lame is the editor. Ludwig Göransson has written the background score, returning from ‘Tenet’. The cast includes Damon as Manhattan Project director Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr., Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s biologist wife Kitty, Florence Pugh as psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie as theoretical physicist Edward Teller and Josh Hartnett as nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence. In the 1940s during World War II when Oppenheimer, a nuclear physicist, was appointed as the director of an initiative code-named “The Manhattan Project,” led a team of scientists in a Los Alamos lab to work on and develop the atomic bomb. The Father of the Atom Bomb, Oppenheimer and his team created this weapon which gave US the edge in World War II. The world, after the discovery of atomic bomb was never the same. This became the most dangerous device invented by mankind and the cause of all wars and power plays. Christopher’s most awaited criminal documentary, Oppenheimer is set to fly into theatres smack-dab, on July 21 across all IMAX screens across India. Known for his Hollywood blockbusters with complex storytelling, Christopher has won hearts already on a national scale – releasing the suspense thriller documentary in Hindi as well for audiences all over India!"
"Oct 5, 2023",positive," Si no has estado con la cabeza enterrada en el suelo durante los últimos meses y tienes cierto interés en el cine, sabrás ya que este fin de semana le pertenece a “Barbenheimer” o a “Oppenbarbie”, es decir, los curiosos términos que se crearon en la redes para referirse al estreno simultáneo de dos superproducciones muy distintas y muy esperadas. Nadie les podrá quitar el dominio, aunque se asoma por ahí un insólito competidor. Cuando yo era un niño y vivía todavía en Perú, una de las historias reales que más me impresionaron fue el lanzamiento por parte de Estados Unidos de dos bombas atómicas en solo tres días y en medio de ciudades japonesas densamente pobladas. El número de muertes, que algunas fuentes colocan por encima de 200 mil, y el hecho de que la mayoría de las víctimas fueran civiles, me parecían hechos absolutamente devastadores sin justificación alguna. ¿Que había pasado con los responsables directos de lo que para mí eran masacres inauditas?, me preguntaba. ¿Fueron capaces de dormir tranquilos luego de estos actos? Tuve algún tipo de respuesta al enterarme del caso de Claude Eatherly, un piloto vinculado a la misión de ataque que fue consumido por la culpa y cuya salud mental se fue deteriorando progresivamente con el paso de los años. Pero no estaba realmente familiarizado con J. Robert Oppenheimer, el físico estadounidense que ha sido llamado “el padre de la bomba atómica” y que, tras lo sucedido en Hiroshima y Nagasaki, se convirtió en un férreo defensor del control nuclear y armamentístico, como leo ahora. “Oppenheimer”, la película de Christopher Nolan que se encuentra ya en cartelera, intenta remediar la falta de conocimiento sobre este personaje trascendental valiéndose de una propuesta particularmente ambiciosa que rehúsa constantemente los dictámenes del ‘biopic’ convencional para transformarse en una reconstrucción épica de las vivencias del científico vinculadas tanto al Proyecto Manhattan -encargado de construir la bomba- como a las vicisitudes posteriores de su vida, marcadas por los cuestionamientos que se le hicieron debido a sus simpatías iniciales por el comunismo. El resultado es ciertamente impresionante y loable, y lo es por diversas razones. La primera pertenece al ámbito estrictamente cinematográfico, y tiene que ver con el hecho de que la cinta se filmó empleando una combinación de IMAX y 65mm que le brinda una grandeza muy particular, además de lucir magníficamente en una pantalla IMAX (es decir, la manera en que la vi). Pero eso no debe llevar a pensar que “Oppenheimer” es simplemente un espectáculo visual; de hecho, la mayor parte de sus escenas se desarrollan en entornos cerrados y se concentran en los rostros de sus personajes. Esta es también una cinta que tiene que verse por la manera en que cuestiona las decisiones militares de las superpotencias y el modo en que estas pueden afectar a la Humanidad entera. Nolan, quien escribió también el guión, no deja de colocar sobre la mesa los argumentos que señalaban la necesidad de un ataque sin precedentes para poder acabar con un conflicto (la Segunda Guerra Mundial) que había cobrado ya millones de víctimas; pero las imágenes que muestran a los ciudadanos estadounidenses celebrando con estruendo el cruel bombardeo dicen más que mil palabras. Pese a ello, uno de los aspectos menos logrados del filme es su exceso de palabras. Nolan hace un trabajo admirable al transmitirnos de manera sencilla algunos conceptos complejos de la física cuántica, y la primera parte de la historia, marcada por aires de ‘thriller’, resulta absolutamente cautivadora. Sin embargo, los constantes saltos en el tiempo -el filme tiene tres segmentos intercalados, filmados en formatos distintos- y la abundancia de conversaciones entre personas relacionadas al tema llegan en cierto momento a ser abrumadores, sobre todo porque la cinta dura tres horas. No ayuda tampoco en ese sentido el excesivo peso que se le da a la banda sonora de Ludwig Göransson, cuyo volumen impide en varios momentos la apreciación correcta de lo que se dice. “Oppenheimer” es un alegato antibelicista y un estudio sobre la redención que, por ello mismo, demanda la exhibición compleja de circunstancias psicológicas y emocionales. Por ese lado, y a pesar de dejar en claro su posición, Nolan no logra desprenderse del todo de esa gelidez que lo ha acompañado a lo largo de su carrera, ni es todavía capaz de desarrollar a personajes femeninos realmente creíbles. Pero lo que ha puesto ante nuestros ojos merece definitivamente ser visto, como lo merece también la increíble actuación de Cillian Murphy en el papel de Oppenheimer y la de un irreconocible pero fantástico Robert Downey Jr. en el rol de Lewis Strauss, el empresario que financió la construcción de las armas nucleares. “Fuera de aquí, fascista”, le dice una adolescente a Barbie durante los primeros minutos de la película, llamada con el mismo nombre de la famosa muñeca y disponible desde hoy en salas. Este simple hecho demuestra lo equivocados que están todos los que, sin haber hecho las averiguaciones correspondientes, se encuentran convencidos de que este es un trabajo complaciente, superficial y bobo que se ha hecho sobre la base de una línea de juguetes complaciente, superficial y boba. Estas averiguaciones les hubieran permitido descubrir, por ejemplo, que “Barbie” (la película) ha sido dirigida por Greta Gerwig, la creadora de la estupenda -y nada complaciente- “Lady Bird” (2017), y escrita por ella misma al lado de Noah Baumbach, realizador y escritor de filmes tan brillantes -y tan poco complacientes- como “The Squid and the Whale” (2005) y “Marriage Story” (2019). Para ser claros, “Barbie” ha sido producida por Mattel Films, la división cinematográfica de Mattel, que es la compañía creadora de la muñeca. Esto podría hacer que quienes piensan que la misma empresa es una entidad perversa que solo se interesa en el dinero, y cuya mayor invención promueve ideales imposibles de riqueza y de belleza, descarten por completo su visionado, incluso cuando, al menos de manera parcial, el mismo filme presenta a Mattel como una entidad perversa que solo se interesa el dinero y cuya invención más grande promueve ideales imposibles de riqueza y de belleza. Se vea como se vea, la cinta de Gerwig, que se estrena con una clasificación de PG-13, es susceptible de generar polémica. La promoción descarada que termina haciendo de las diferentes versiones de Barbie y Ken, surgidas con el paso de los años para lidiar con la falta de diversidad y los reclamos de sus consumidores, está evidentemente destinada a incrementar las ventas de una línea que ha perdido lustre con el paso del tiempo. Pero es a la vez una de las mejores películas del año en términos cinematográficos, probablemente la mejor comedia que hayamos visto en mucho tiempo y un producto extraordinariamente entretenido que promueve valores acordes con la búsqueda de una sociedad más justa. Por ese lado, habrá otra controversia, por supuesto. En la película, Barbie (interpretada por la maravillosa Margot Robbie) se ve obligada a abandonar brevemente el mundo de fantasía en el que vive, y que se encuentra dominado por las mujeres, luego de alterar involuntariamente el estado de las cosas. Al llegar al ‘mundo real’ -más precisamente, a la ciudad de Los Ángeles- acompañada por Ken (Ryan Gosling), queda desconcertada ante el dominio del patriarcado, a diferencia de lo que sucede con Ken, quien se siente cada vez más fascinado por el cambio de roles. No estoy usando la palabra ‘patriarcado’ gratuitamente. Los diálogos de Gerwig y Baumbach la emplean constantemente, hasta el punto de hacer que pierda contundencia y se sienta forzada. En todo caso, Hollywood impuso en el mundo entero sus proclamas de supremacía blanca y de dominio masculino a lo largo de casi toda su historia, por lo que las prédicas feministas no me parecen desacertadas, incluso cuando carecen de sutileza. Lo importante aquí es que, sin dejar nunca de lado lo que quiere comunicar, la película tiene momentos absolutamente hilarantes, así como referencias a la mitología ‘barbiana’ y a la historia del séptimo arte que deberían complacer tanto a los fans del popular juguete como a los cinéfilos más acérrimos. Por otro lado, la puesta en escena, respaldada por una excelente labor del director de fotografía mexicano Rodrigo Prieto (“Brokeback Mountain”), resulta ingeniosa, colorida y encantadora. Y no hay que olvidarse de la actriz latina America Ferrera, quien tiene un papel destacado -y finalmente decisivo- al interpretar a Gloria, una empleada de Mattel con conciencia propia. En vista de que la cartelera de este fin de semana tiene ya ganadores incuestionables y absolutos, cualquier otro estreno que se produzca en los mismos días tiene todas las de perder, y los estudios lo saben. Esto significa que, en esos casos, los lanzamientos que se hacen no cuentan probablemente con un gran nivel de confianza por parte de sus distribuidores. Pero si bien “Cobweb” es un título menor, sobre todo cuando se lo compara con “Oppenheimer” y “Barbie”, no se trata tampoco de una película descartable. Tiene incluso el potencial de atraer de manera significativa a quienes opten por evitar las salas completamente llenas y favorezcan las propuestas pertenecientes a otros géneros, en este caso, el terror, que resulta normalmente rentable en los cines debido a su gran nivel de aceptación. En su primer trabajo como director de largometrajes, Samuel Bodin hace gala de un dominio de la puesta en escena que resulta ciertamente sorprendente. “Cobweb” posee un gran sentido de la atmósfera, y los recursos visuales que emplea, mayormente prácticos, son los responsables principales de su efectividad en el área de los sustos, aunque tampoco decepciona la elaboración de la ‘criatura’, realizada evidentemente con el aporte de elaborados trucos digitales. A pesar de no ser necesariamente original y de tener varios momentos que ponen a prueba la credibilidad, como suele suceder en las propuestas comerciales provenientes del horror, el guión de Chris Thomas Devlin logra mantenernos en vilo e incluye momentos bastante brutales, mientras cuenta la historia de Peter (Woody Norman), un pre adolescente que vive en una vieja casona embrujada al lado de sus dos padres, Carol (Lizzy Kaplan) y Mark (Antony Starr), quienes empiezan a dar muestras de inestabilidad cada vez más alarmantes a medida que transcurre el relato.

"Oct 2, 2023",negative," “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan's mammoth and exhausting portrait of the father of the atomic bomb, desperately wants to impress you, but it's too high on its own fumes to make good on its lofty ambitions. The “Inception” auteur's first effort after parting ways with Warner Bros. adapts the Pulitzer Prize-winning Oppenheimer biography “American Prometheus” for the screen (the bigger the better). It detonates all sorts of conflicting emotions, but let's go with the top two: awe at its visual splendor and impressionistic cadences, and frustration at its stubborn insistence in stitching together two films in one. There's the one you probably came to see, which is the story of a team of brainy academics brought together to create a weapon of mass destruction before those across the Atlantic do, and thus secure a victory for the Allied powers during World War II. But the Universal release also springs forward several years to offer a glimpse at the political fallout, lathered in backstabbing and guilt, from those twin mushroom clouds. The latter narrative strand initially appears to serve as a framing device for the first one. It's mostly comprised of a series of hearings in 1954, behind closed doors, by the Atomic Energy Commission, in order to determine whether J. Robert Oppenheimer, now nearly a decade removed from his best-known accomplishment, will retain his security clearance. The hearings provide Nolan with an engine to hone in on Oppenheimer's public and private life. The bulk of “Oppenheimer” unfolds in these artfully crafted flashbacks, bolstered by quick cuts, stream-of-consciousness links between different moments in time, set to the relentless drone of Ludwig Goransson's wall-to-wall music score. It's an ornate fever dream that metastasizes into a nightmare, in ways that are initially thrilling but ultimately draining. You feel your enthusiasm ebb away. Nolan takes us as far back as Oppenheimer's days in Cambridge, where a student with disdain for mathematics and lab work meets fellow travelers who will prove to be pivotal figures in the years to come. That apt but restless pupil, played as a young man and as the eventual agent of destruction by Cillian Murphy, is encouraged by Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) to complete his doctorate at the University of Gottingen in Germany.  Oppenheimer meets fellow theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg (Matthia Schweighofer). Both men are mutual admirers, fully unaware they would be on opposing sides on the arms race in the coming conflict. Serving as a conscience and a welcome source of warmth for our driven protagonist is fellow physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi (a nearly unrecognizable David Krumholtz, quietly becoming one of the movie's MVPs). “Oppenheimer” could have used more of the modesty that the pudgy Rabi, with his maternal instinct to remind the rail-thin Oppie to “eat, eat,” brings to the table, but Nolan forges ahead as if he's making the cinematic equivalent of the great American novel. Back on U.S. soil, Oppenheimer's associations include members of the Communist Party, though he keeps his distance. He begins a sordid affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a party member who happens to be a married woman, before he meets Kitty (Emily Blunt), the woman he would eventually wed. Rare (for Nolan) glimpses of lovemaking ensue, climaxing with a surreal flourish later in the film that draws unintentional laughs. Nolan may not be afraid to show sex on screen (though Murphy shows conspicuously less skin than Pugh), but the director remains a bit of a square in that department. But “Oppenheimer” can't stop, won't stop, and after overcoming several hurdles, Uncle Sam comes knocking, in the form of U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the Corps of Engineers officer who directed the ultra-secret Manhattan Project. The verbal sparring between Oppie and Groves, leading to Oppie spearheading the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, is one of the film's highlights.  The fireworks that the characters' arguments generate, acted to perfection by the stars, go against the rest of the film's eat-your-veggies approach to 20th-century history, thus underscoring the need for “Oppenheimer's” against-the-clock Manhattan Project scenes to be their own movie, unencumbered by the added weight of the film's cause-and-effect framing. (Several scenes involving Oppie and Albert Einstein, well played by Tom Conti, attempt to weave in both timelines, but they're not enough.) To give credit where credit is due, Nolan nails the “money shot” sequence: the do-or-die nuclear test that proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the atom bomb would serve its lethal purpose and bring the war to an end. But then it dawns of you that the movie's not quite done. Not even close. In what feels like an additional hour (it's a bit less, but goodness, you feel the length), “Oppenheimer” returns to the 1954 hearings and dives headlong into the ripple effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. This is when the spotlight shines on Robert Downey Jr.'s Lewis Strauss -- businessman, philanthropist, naval officer, member of the Atomic Energy Commission and ostensible helping hand to an embattled Oppenheimer besieged by attacks on his character. Downey takes the juicy role and runs with it. The “Iron Man” star helps anchor several scenes (shot in IMAX black and white, a first for Kodak) where Strauss, up for a Cabinet post in the Eisenhower administration several years after the AEC Oppenheimer hearings, is grilled by senators about Oppenheimer and the nuclear program.  Taken on their own, the 1950s scenes are a gripping if somewhat naïve and simplistic, portrayal of politics as a Darwinian game of chess. They also swallow the film whole, dampening the excitement we feel as this group of scientists pull off the seemingly impossible. “Oppenheimer” would have benefited from a splitting of atomic particles, or in this case, narratives into two different films. Subtlety is not a Nolan specialty, and “Oppenheimer” fuses his strengths and self-indulgent tendencies into a maelstrom of sound and fury that bring to mind Oliver Stone in full-tilt “JFK” mode. Some of the intricate cross-cutting also recalls Terrence Malick, “The Tree of Life” in particular, but Nolan and his bells and whistles lack Malick's humility before the infinite. To be fair, “Oppenheimer” is a sizable step up from “Tenet,” Nolan's impenetrable 2020 thriller that's toppled by its convoluted time-hopping spy games.  But his latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance. Caught in the middle is a uniformly strong cast made up of too many other familiar faces to name here. As for Murphy, the “Peaky Blinders” star rises above the chaos. It's a pity the movie ends up imploding, its adroitly conceived puzzle pieces coming apart in a rain of noble intentions and unmitigated ego.

"Sep 29, 2023",positive," Christopher Nolan ha sido un férreo defensor del cine físico durante toda su carrera. Ya lo era antes de la pandemia, pero tras ver que el 'streaming' se ha comido la magia de la pantalla grande tras el confinamiento, ha resurgido decidido a demostrar que las películas están hechas para disfrutarlas lejos del salón de tu casa. Todo eso se percibe en la espectacularidad de Oppenheimer. La película sobre el físico destaca por el uso del sonido, que ya había mostrado en otras obras como Dunkerque (2018) o Tenet (2020). Si esas ya fueron muestras absolutas de su maestría con este lenguaje cinematográfico, esta vez se supera a sí mismo. Así consigue que Oppenheimer sea una película sobre la bomba atómica en la que los momentos más angustiosos se producen cuando reina el silencio absoluto en la sala."
"Sep 25, 2023",positive," The first indication that Christopher Nolan was going to be a unique and interesting filmmaker was there for all to see with his noteworthy second feature, “Memento,” which was released in 2000 when he was 30 years of age. The movie’s non-linear narrative is delivered as two different sets of scenes interspersed during the film. There are sequences in color that are shown in reverse order, which reveal the mental state of the protagonist to the audience. Some scenes are shown chronologically in black-and-white. Nolan likes to play fast and loose with time and space. If he isn’t careful, this form of narrative storytelling can become pretentious. If he’s running on all cylinders, there’s an elegance to his movies that is beautiful and satisfying to behold. Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is beautiful to behold. Whether or not it’s satisfying depends on your appreciation for how he creates his cinema. The film is a feast of non-linear moviemaking. It’s the most Nolanesque feature he’s made. The story that’s front-and-center during the epic three-hour movie is the making of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and its use on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in a successful effort, which was approved by President Harry S. Truman, with the hopes of ending the war in the Pacific. Born in New York City, J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life, as highlighted in the film, is centered around Princeton University in New Jersey, Cambridge in England, the University of California at Berkeley, the extended sojourn at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the building of the bomb, and intense political hearings courtesy of the Washington, D.C. witch hunt for Communist sympathizers in the United States government. “Oppenheimer” the movie is rich in detail. That it unreels in flashbacks and flash-forwards may be maddening for some, but not for me. It’s also in black-and-white and in color. In “Oppenheimer,” Nolan takes an intelligent topic and turns it into a suspenseful experience. The director, who wrote the screenplay based on the biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, has the canvas to concentrate on theoretical physicist Oppenheimer’s intellectualism, ever-increasing self-confidence, internal thought processes, poise and popularity as a leader, and relationships with women (he was unfaithful to his wife). Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is central to the greatness of the casting. Murphy never loses J. Robert’s sense of duty or his belief that his goal is to save the lives of members of the American military by succeeding with the Manhattan Project. He’s a man who rarely eats. He cares about everybody who’s working on the bomb. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who oversees Los Alamos for Truman, is the kind of general that’s needed when time is of the essence. Oppenheimer’s long-suffering wife Katherine (Emily Blunt) provides necessary strength when it matters most. His mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) was a psychiatrist and occasional journalist. Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) is visited in scenes of visual poetry. Does the movie falter in any way? Yes, but not enough to derail it for me. Once the atomic bomb is dropped, there’s still 40 minutes to go, and it’s here that Nolan lets the subject matter get away from him slightly. Oppenheimer wasn’t onboard with the U. S. government’s desire to progress from the atomic to the hydrogen bomb. Truman calls him a “crybaby.” This reluctance commands most of the film’s attention as Senate and House hearings revolving around Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss’s future in Washington and Oppenheimer’s sudden disfavor with certain politicians are dissected in brutally intense black-and-white sequences that prove exhausting as because they go on far too long. Nolan is insistent on making certain the focus stays on his main character. So much so, that Japan and the horrors caused by the dropping of the bomb are only hinted at. Is Oppenheimer a Communist? Was his wife? Is he a traitor for not wanting to continue to create weapons of mass destruction? Some of the material could have been edited more tightly. The saving grace for these seemingly endless scenes of political performance art are twofold. One is Murphy’s ability to project an almost religious dedication to the rightness of Oppenheimer’s beliefs. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the body count appalled him. The other is the scintillating performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Strauss, a bureaucratic game player of the highest order. The moment when Strauss realizes what Oppenheimer is actually doing in front of the determined members of Congress is motion picture acting Nirvana. The 1954 hearing to adjudicate whether or not Oppenheimer’s federal security should be renewed allows Nolan almost infinite time to spin his directorial vision in myriad directions, some previously hinted at, some unique, but all defining Nolan the director and Oppenheimer the man. The “father of the atomic bomb” is well-served. One truth in the the movie is that the female characters track with what history recorded. In that era, women were less than equal and except for wives and the occasional secretary, Los Alamos was a man’s world. In the overall story, Mrs. Oppenheimer and her husband’s mistress are the most visible female characters. Oppenheimer is a fascinating individual. His intense dreams are either rapturous or tormenting. He figuratively visits the cosmos in them. He’s a scientist, but for him science is an art form. The true and genuine highlight for Nolan, Murphy, and the movie is the immediate build-up to, and then the explosion of, the test bomb. It’s a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come. First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
"Sep 20, 2023",positive,"Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade."
"Sep 17, 2023",positive," No figure stands more squarely at the crossroads of 20th century science and politics than J. Robert Oppenheimer, forever known as “father of the atomic bomb”. An epic story requires an epic film, and Christopher Nolan has given Oppenheimer the treatment he demands, in a three-hour bio pic that manages to balance a portrait of this enigmatic personality with the earth-shattering events that defined his life and times. For Nolan, it’s a remarkably well-organised film, considering that his previous effort, Tenet (2020), was virtually incomprehensible. One suspects this owes a debt to a script written in collaboration with Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, authors of the 2005 Oppenheimer biography, American Prometheus. The film doesn’t tell us anything about Oppenheimer’s upbringing as part of a wealthy Jewish family in New York that owned paintings by Van Gogh and Picasso. We skip straight to his post-graduate studies at Cambridge, where he is clumsy in the laboratory, but a prodigious theorist. He’s also unstable enough to inject an apple with poison, as a way of getting even with a lecturer who humiliates him. It’s an anecdote to demonstrate the old cliché that genius and madness are closely aligned. If we need further proof of our subject’s mental dexterity, there’s also the small matter of learning Dutch in six weeks so he can deliver a lecture on quantum mechanics. Oppenheimer’s backstory is told in flashbacks, framed by his appearance in front of a select committee in 1954, where he is being investigated as a security risk. At this stage he is the most famous scientist in America, renowned for his leadership at Los Alamos, but his credibiity has been undermined by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who has worked behind the scenes to bring Oppenheimer down. It’s a complex relationship between the two men, as Strauss had been a key supporter of Oppenheimer, but turned against him after the scientist made him look foolish in a hearing. The story of the Atom bomb is rotated with this tale of political and personal intrigue, in which Strauss plays Iago to Oppenheimer’s Othello. The resonances with present-day politics are unmistakable, as we recognise echoes of the way public health experts and environmental scientists were demonised by opportunistic politicians in the Trump camp – a process that has bled into the public realm via social media and extremist opinion-mongering masquerading as news. To be truly without blemish in front of a committee in the McCarthy era, it wasn’t sufficient to have demonstrated one’s loyalty to the United States by helping develop the greatest weapon of mass destruction in history. As we see during the flashbacks, Oppenheimer took a lively interest in politics. He was a vocal supporter of the Spanish republic, he argued for the unionisation of the science department at Berkeley, and associated with Communist Party members, including Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a disturbed ‘fatal attraction’ with whom he had a long-running affair. Strauss and his colleagues, notably Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, were aware of Oppenheimer’s political beliefs when they enlisted him to head up the Manhattan Project. The USA was in competition the Germans in the race to build a nuclear weapon, and Oppenheimer was simply the best man for the job. As a non-observant Jew with left-wing sympathies, his antipathy for the Nazis overruled any scruples about the destructive force he was about to release on the world. The argument was compelling: if the Germans got the bomb first, they would be sure to use it. For the Americans, who styled themselves as guardians of democracy, it could conceivably act as a deterrent to unjust wars – a weapon of peace. Oppenheimer chose the location for the secret laboratories and testing grounds in the New Mexico desert, he assembled the scientists he needed for the project, and brought it to fruition. When the Third Reich collapsed but the Japanese fought on, work on the bomb continued. The scientists created the weapon, but its deployment was a matter for the politicians. When Harry Truman dropped bombs on Hiroshima, then Nagasaki, on 6 and 9 August, 1945, Oppenheimer seems to have been stricken with guilt and remorse for what he had done. Although publically celebrated as the father of the A-bomb, he used his influence to argue against the development of an even greater weapon, the H-bomb, which was being promoted by his colleague, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). By 1954, when he sat before the security committee, Oppenheimer’s pacifism had made him a suspect figure among America’s Cold Warriors. This distrust was exploited by the devious Strauss. The third strand of this movie looks at Strauss’s efforts to get himself confirmed by a Senate Committee as Head of the Atomic Energy Commission, with his press secretary, played by Alden Ehrenreich, gradually teasing out the true nature of his boss’s double game. Oppenheimer owes a huge part of its success to Cillian Murphy’s performance. The Irish actor who always seems to play supporting roles, has relished the opportunity to step into the limelight, and must now be in contention for an Oscar. His achievement is to portray Oppenheimer, not just as a haunted man, but as a lifelong misfit whose intelligence set him apart from every peer group. Oppenheimer tells his Communist friends he has read all three volumes of Das Kapital but found Marx’s arguments unconvincing. He sees no reason why he shouldn’t support just causes, such as the Spanish Republic or unionism, when there are obvious strategic reasons to stay away. The place he loves most in the world is the New Mexico desert, but it’s here he produces the first nuclear explosion. There is an intellectual arrogance to Oppenheimer that infuriates his opponents, and occasionally trips him up. Having taken on the task of building the bomb, he has to front up and celebrate the strike on Hiroshima while he is inwardly reeling at the magnitude of horror he has helped unleash. He finds it difficult to defend himself against determined but dishonest opponents, even as his angry wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), urges him to act. If Oppenheimer is a philosopher amid the dirty realities of politics, Lewis Strauss is a disciple of Machiavelli. Robert Downey Jr. is so good in this role, one could almost forget all his past misdeeds, on and off the screen. The rest of the cast is a who’s who of Hollywood talent, with figures such as Kenneth Branagh (Niels Bohr), Tom Conti (Albert Einstein) and Gary Oldman (Harry S. Truman), being assigned minor but crucial parts. It’s rare that a film manages to look at a figure as monumental as Oppenheimer, without caricaturing him as a hero or villain. The scientist is in part the author of his downfall, but also a victim of circumstances and outright conspiracy. After spending three hours in his company, we can’t exactly approve or disapprove. Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can’t resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives. He is a figure that invites the most dramatic comparisons, not just as Prometheus, who stole fire from the Gods, but the man, in the Gospel of St. Mark, who gains the whole world and loses his own soul."
"Sep 14, 2023",positive,"[Christopher Nolan's] most stirring plea to humanity yet. A three-hour drama that plays like a terse thriller, weaving Nolan’s deep-seated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures."
"Sep 12, 2023",positive," Robert Angier wanted to perform the perfect magic trick, Dom Cobb wanted to live his perfect dream (literally), Joseph Cooper wanted to find a perfect planet; now, Christopher Nolan has made a biopic on the man who wanted to create the perfect bomb. But let’s get this out of the way first; does the film’s main event, termed as a cinematic experience for the ages on IMAX, live up to its almost unbearable expectations? Well, yes and no.  But the explosion in isolation (just the Trinity one; Nolan makes the divisive decision not to show the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings) does not justify the hype, as hair-raising a visual achievement it may be. Instead, the filmmaker completely goes for the jugular and paralyses us with shock in a scene right after, when “the father of the atomic bomb” has to address a crowd of colleagues who are stomping their feet in rhythm, cheering the attacks on the Japanese cities. A traumatised ‘Oppie’ (as his friends call him) — now in full realisation of the horrors he has unleashed upon the planet — stammers his way through what is meant to be a victory jaunt, as he hallucinates the phantoms of his horrific creation that would change the course of history. With help from composer Ludwig Göransson’s anxiety-inducing score, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema’s staggering use of 65-millimeter film, and editor Jennifer Lame’s frenetic frames, Nolan takes you deep into the mind (and all its tragic machinations) of a protagonist repelled by his own eminence and tortured by his futile attempt to advocate against further nuclear development. His primary weapon of choice is Cillian Murphy, who has been around forever but still remains strangely unseen except in Nolan’s universe and his career-defining turn as Thomas Shelby. The Irishman in the role of Oppenheimer is a true casting coup (one of many in the film) with his gaunt face and haunting eyes tormenting you with every piercing gaze, glance and grimace. Here, he’s magnetic in the role of the scientist who bent the world to his will and whim for decades, until it finally stops revolving around him. The physical resemblance notwithstanding, Murphy captures Oppenheimer’s internal turmoil and external arrogance with some amount of immodest ease; we never quite understand him fully, but that’s precisely what Nolan wants.  But Oppenheimer’s sprawl both astounds and frustrates. Nolan, of course, complicates the chronology like only Nolan can; we are thrown head-first into different timelines — that switch between dazzling colour and black-and-white — representing both ‘fission’ and ‘fusion,’ two terms the director uses right at the beginning of the film, to indicate how energy is created and dissipated.  From his beginnings in the 1920s as a genius student galvanized by the prospect of making breakthroughs in quantum mechanics, to teaching and collaborating with other prodigious minds at Berkeley, to embracing the leftist ideals that would later invigorate him to develop the bomb ahead of the Nazis, Nolan charts Oppenheimer’s early days in linear-enough fashion. The dialogues and debates bristle with a kinetic sort of energy that is palpable, and we remain invested in all the dizzying equations and exposition that should rightfully perplex, but somehow make sense. Things then get heated. Oppenheimer quickly encounters a number of people who will have far-reaching ramifications on his life, such as nuclear physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett well and truly owning his renaissance), the stern but supportive Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (a fantastic-as-usual Matt Damon), and the eventual hydrogen bomb inventor Edward Teller (Benny Safdie in a bit of a hard sell). He’s also juggling the two women who make and (nearly) break him; the incendiary psychiatrist and Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) with whom he has a steamy on-and-off romance, and his wife, the boozy Kitty (a supremely disdainful Emily Blunt who surely deserved more screen time). There’s a revolving army of other supporting characters too — some fragmented, some whole, none streamlined — sportingly essayed by an array of stars that reads like a who’s who list of Hollywood royalty; Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Oppenheimer’s mentor), Gary Oldman as President Harry S Truman (naturally stealing the show with one of the best scenes set in the Oval Office after the bomb is dropped), Tom Conti as a regretfully ponderous Albert Einstein (!) and Rami Malek in a small but frightfully important cameo. It is Robert Downey Jr., though, who emerges as the film’s most prominent game-changer, and the Marvel superstar delivers the finest performance of his career as Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss, who makes it his mission to dismantle Oppenheimer’s credibility and service to the United States government. If that sounds like a lot to take in, it is. But this is where Nolan falters; the Strauss-Oppenheimer rivalry, fuelled by jealousy and humiliation, spirals into a full-blown revenge saga in the second half, primarily taking shape inside claustrophobic conference rooms populated with suits. From being an enigmatic origin story about one of the most legendary scientific minds in history, the film turns into part-courtroom battle, part-political drama, as Nolan tries to (or rather, lets us) decipher what Oppenheimer’s future legacy will be; it stifles more than it intrigues. Indeed, one of the rare times you crack a wry smile is when some US officials are ascertaining which Japanese cities to bomb, and one of them comments that he removed Kyoto from the list because his wife enjoyed their honeymoon there. Still, the monumental world Nolan creates often results in an immersive experience that is not often witnessed in biopics. Even if some stretches play out way too long, Oppenheimer constantly reminds us that everyone quickly recovered from the perversion of war to accept the bomb; a burden that we will forever share with Robert.

"Sep 6, 2023",positive," Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer? According to the history books he was either a saviour or a devil, and of course with his involvement in the development of the Atomic bomb he was certainly the embodiment of his famous quote lifted from the Bhagavad-Gita “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.” Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer posits Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as both and symbol and a man, but despite its expansive run-time never gives a clear answer to who he was. He remains enigmatic, a ‘sphynx’ as one character terms him. Genius, dilletante, womaniser, madman, egomaniac, innovator – all these adjectives are used to describe him, and all are correct, yet even when Nolan puts laser focus on the man and the myth, we are still left wondering. Perhaps we are left wondering because Nolan is actually not as interested in telling the audience about Oppenheimer as he is with crafting a political thriller and a treatise on what mutually assured destruction looks like. Oppenheimer was playing a zero-sum game from the moment he was recruited as head scientist for the Manhattan project, a fact that existed in the periphery of his understanding but never quite hit home until he finally delivered the bomb Truman was intent on using despite the war being ostensibly over. The film moves between timelines in Oppenheimer’s life. The young student who went to study in England who annoyed his professor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy) and impressed Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). The same young student would attempt to poison Blackett, give lectures in Dutch – a language he learned in weeks, shake the hand of Werner Heisenberg and develop a lifelong friendship with fellow Jewish physicist Isidor Rabi (an excellent David Krumholtz) all before returning to Berkeley to set up the first quantum physics curriculum. Intercut with Oppenheimer’s ostensibly linear story (Nolan rarely uses linear even when attempting linear) is his troubled relationship with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) the commissioner of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and the closed “trial” of Oppenheimer in 1954 in which he tried to keep his revoked Q clearance that had been taken from him under suspicion of communist activities during the McCarthy period. Nolan immerses the viewer in perspective by having Oppenheimer’s life in colour and Strauss’ machinations in black and white, including his attempt to enter cabinet as a congressman. Nolan is a technical wizard, one with a genius touch with his choices of cinematographers (the inimitable Hoyte Van Hoytema once again pairing with Nolan), production designers (Ruth De Jong), editors (Jennifer Lame) and composers (Ludwig Göransson who scored Tenet). He is also a capable script writer, yet somewhere in all this mastery is a small hollow. Oppenheimer is intensely humanistic, melancholy, enraged but not quite engaged. Dig through the film and cut some of the bloat and there is an astonishing piece of cinema. The bloat caveat aside, Nolan has created as masterpiece. Intelligent and insightful. The performances he elicits from Murphy, Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer are marvellous. Supporting cast such as Matt Damon as Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves who brought Oppenheimer on to the Manhattan project, Benny Safdie as rival scientist Edward Teller, Josh Hartnett as the apolitical engineering scientist Ernest Lawrence, and Jason Clarke as the ‘prosecutor’ Roger Robb all give committed and elevated performances. Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s doomed erstwhile lover Jean Tatlock is perhaps least served by the film. Oppenheimer’s story is too dense to recount in a simple review, so the key points of interest include his relationship with his unfulfilled and domestically resentful wife, Kitty (who was a scientist in her own right) whose affiliations with the communist party, as well as those of Jean Tatlock’s and Robert’s brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold) led him to be closely monitored for many years by the FBI. Oppenheimer’s brittle friendship with Albert Einstein (played with great heartbreak by Tom Conti), and of course his activities heading the Manhattan project out of El Paso. The bulk of the film revolves around the race to make the bomb before the Germans do, something Oppenheimer feels is his duty not only as an American but as a Jewish American. Isidor Rabi is reluctant to join the project because he does not want to see something as pure as theoretical physics being turned into a weapon. It’s a subtle warning that Oppenheimer does not heed at the time but one that will haunt him. There is a plenitudinous number of discussions about uranium, plutonium, core reactions, chain reactions, arguments between scientists of many allied nations (not Russia) all taking part in the race to beat the Nazis. Some of this is discussion is necessary for a sense of verisimilitude of the scientific process and also needed to show how Teller and Oppenheimer became bitter rivals. It does slow the pace of the film, which is breakneck in other areas, but once we reach the point of the Trinity trial Nolan’s exquisite mastery of form is on full display. He manages to inject small doses of humour into one of the most nail-biting sequences in the film – Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid) sits in his car and insists the windscreen will absorb the UV rays. Teller lathers himself in sunscreen. It all builds up to a crescendo where for the first time in the film Nolan employs a moment of silence during the flash of the explosion where the real voice of Oppenheimer speaks his famous line, and then the most bone rattling boom in recent cinema. The fact that the trial happened after the surrender of Germany weighed slightly on Oppenheimer and other scientists, they thought they were building the bomb to defeat the Nazis. Yet, like the man addicted to seeing his experiment through Oppenheimer steams ahead. As soon as he has delivered the successful test he is cut out of the military loop and like everyone else in the world hears of the bombings of Japan via Truman’s announcement on the radio. Nolan is clever enough to never show Hiroshima or Nagasaki and the aftermath. Instead, there is a sequence where Oppenheimer imagines he is stepping over burning bodies in a celebratory speech at Los Alamos. Nolan breaks with reality several times in the film and these are some of the best moments. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his life – his blue eyes bearing down into the camera filled with eternally conflicting emotions, and sometimes lacking emotion altogether. Robert Downey Jr. is easily giving his best dramatic performance since Chaplin and Emily Blunt is spellbinding as pragmatic but troubled alcoholic, Kitty. Matt Damon’s charm as an actor is used to every advantage as he plays off Murphy. Alden Ehrenreich is brilliant as an unnamed Senate Aide who pieces together Strauss’ conspiracy against Oppenheimer which was started by Strauss being embarrassed by Oppenheimer’s refusal to support the export of isotopes to foreign nations while Strauss was head of the AEC. The vindictive pettiness of Strauss is one of many factors that led to the slow downfall of an American hero. The other was Oppenheimer’s resistance to supporting the creation of hydrogen bombs, because as he well knew the arms race with the Soviet Union was triggered and men have a way of ensuring that the weapons they create, they use. Oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying, dizzying and bloated, a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of Nolan’s best and most political works to date. With a cast that is stacked with talent (not even mentioned are Casey Affleck, Dane DeHaan, Remi Malek, David Dastmalchian, Alex Wolff, Matthew Modine, Gary Oldman) and a premise that allows Nolan to mix a certain level of intimate scale as well as spectacle with his material that was lacking in Tenet and to an extent, Interstellar, Oppenheimer is a merger of what Nolan does best as a director – even if the result is sometimes flawed. Who is J. Robert Oppenheimer? As Albert Einstein tells him, that is not up to him – his legacy will always belong to whoever wants to claim it for whatever purpose it will serve.

"Sep 2, 2023",positive," Since the writer/director burst onto the scene in 2000 with the neo-noir Memento, those who like ambitious yarns and foreboding push-ins have considered him a sure bet with each new release. Fans have claimed that The Prestige, The Dark Knight, and Dunkirk are nothing short of masterpieces, while others cite the narrative geometry of Inception and Interstellar as their preferred brand of dense escapism. Yet, all of them are anchored by showstopping visuals captured on celluloid and with minimal CGI, making them optical stunners as well. The true test of Oppenheimer is whether Nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms. Fittingly, Nolan succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion — just like his protagonist. Per his own house style, Nolan doesn’t tell Oppenheimer in a linear fashion. Critics have called that a crutch in the past, but in his best features there’s always a reason for the structure. In Memento, Nolan wanted viewers to experience the unreliable memory of his protagonist by depriving them of established information. In Oppenheimer, he’s working at the intersection of time and space, catching molecules mid-dance, explosions pre-flare, and ultimately an entire life both assembling and blowing apart at the same time. Early on, we find J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) fighting homesickness as he struggles abroad to complete his PhD in physics. He can tell times are changing for Jewish people in Europe, but he also feels unwelcome because he’s primarily interested in theory over laboratory work. Upon returning to the United States to lecture on the emerging field of quantum mechanics, Oppenheimer is approached by US Army Officer Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who wants to name the physicist the director of the Manhattan Project. Suddenly, a man who was always satisfied with conjecture alone is given a chance to fight the Nazis by forcing theory into reality. Oppenheimer’s love life is integral to the proceedings, as it fleshes out who he is as a person — an egoist philanderer who’s never willing to give himself completely to one partner. Although his liaisons with communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) leave a mark, it’s biologist Katherine Puening (Emily Blunt) whom he eventually marries, despite her alcoholism and the grudge she carries for becoming a mother instead of an academic. Their embattled relationship isn’t quite the centerpiece of the story, but it serves as a deft fulcrum for the pivoting political drama. If that weren’t enough, Oppenheimer’s quest to make the first successful atom bomb is intercut with black-and-white sequences from years later that focus mostly on Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, a politician and the head of the Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss tries to flatter Oppenheimer into keeping America at the forefront of the arms race, which may have worked before the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki — but Oppenheimer grew into a different mindset later, arguing for de-escalation to salve his conscience. There’s no doubt this is a packed movie. Watching Oppenheimer is a bit like speed-reading a history textbook, except with great dialogue and a searing Ludwig Göransson score. It’s truly surprising how few effects sequences Nolan offers here. He still shoots a good chunk of the film in 65mm IMAX, but it’s most often deployed in bracing close-ups. The choice is subtle but effective: Murphy begins the film as a youthful neurotic emboldened by his own genius. Many of those early shots are in 35mm and traditional widescreen. By the end, our protagonist is hollowed to the core, and having his gaunt features stretched four stories high in full IMAX ratio is all Nolan needs to convey what is lost. Is there an Oscar in it for Murphy? After delivering great work for decades, this definitely feels like his time. His performance is impressively lived-in, while never feeling like he’s changing gears to evolve in the back half. Ditto for Downey Jr., who’s about as good here as he’s ever been. Strauss is a complex man; he’s unquestionably a patriot, but you never know where his true feelings end and his political ambitions begin. Top marks for Damon and Blunt as well, who distinguish themselves against a certified murderer’s row of supporting talent. In fact, the sheer volume of the cast is the only potential problem here, as some of the smaller roles end up being crucial to the narrative in the final hour. Of course, Nolan is upholding history to some degree, and it’s true that some folks weren’t very close with Oppenheimer and still were called to testify about him once the physicist began opposing hydrogen bomb research. It just would have been nice to feel those puzzle pieces falling into place instead of trying to recall which five-minute role a person played two hours ago. Despite that, we’re still talking about one of the best and most riveting biopics in recent memory. Some will bemoan how Nolan could have made a more conventional thriller that flexes the real fury of a mushroom cloud and gapes at cities flattened by fire. But it’s the space between molecules that Nolan is interested in. Like All the President’s Men and Zodiac before it, this epic chronicle of American history is more about the before and the after, the moments that birthed the revelations.  The director should be prepared to weather criticisms that he focuses entirely on the men behind the bomb and not the victims of its devastation. Yet a scene showing a host of government officials confronted with the brutality of their efforts spells out Nolan’s intent: The camera is kept firmly on Oppenheimer while his contemporaries react audibly to the horrors before their eyes. Here, Nolan has a perfect opportunity to show exactly what the Manhattan Project has wrought, but instead, we hear vivid descriptions of the Japanese victims while staring at the man responsible.  Nolan isn’t ignoring the lives destroyed; he just doesn’t want to dramatize them for the sake of pathos that’s already in the movie. The approach also drives a second layer of commentary where the film remains siloed in the myopic view of white men, as even today that’s how U.S. decision-makers experience the ravages they cause. Ultimately, the film draws immense power from what it doesn’t show — and still the fallout is palpable in every scene, burning bright and never fading."
"Aug 29, 2023",positive," Not quite your standard biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb”, Nolan’s latest casts slender Irishman Murphy as the titular scientist. Focusing his story around theoretical physicist Oppenheimer and his work leading up to and following the successful creation of the first nuclear bomb, Nolan captures a portrait of a brilliant man who was often in conflict with his work and his own proclivities. Based on the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer looks at a life both inside and out of the Manhattan Project and his interactions with the various scientists, students,  politicos, Communists, military generals, and women he encountered over the years. There has been much talk of Oppenheimer being Nolan’s best work, comparing it to Oliver Stone’s JFK in terms of scale, scope, and conspiracy. While I would argue that even an “okay” Nolan film is still a good film, as good as Oppenheimer is, it is simply is not his best (I’d rather reserve that accolade for the mind-bending Inception or Interstellar). At his best, however, is Murphy. Oppenheimer marks his third major role in a film for the director, having previously appeared in Dunkirk, Inception, and as one of the main villains in Batman Begins (and subsequent franchise cameos). The actor convincingly spans Oppenheimer’s life, from young intellectual in a lab through to the weary man whose brilliance wrought the deaths of hundreds of thousands, unleashing an awesome power that humanity perhaps should not hold. Murphy plays each iteration of Oppenheimer well, which is a must for an actor who is in virtually every scene of the films three-hour runtime. There is a lot of be said about the impressive ensemble of actors in Nolan’s film. To name just a few: Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich, and Dane DeHaan. Quite obviously, there are only two women in that cast list, more or less a product of the scientific community of the era. Yes, there are a few women (and people of colour) in science lectures, classrooms, and in the Manhattan Project, but largely, this is the story of white men. Pugh and Blunt are the top-billed women with the former having only a small but pivotal role as an early one of Oppenheimer’s lovers. Blunt has much more screentime but even she isn’t given much to do as Oppenheimer’s wife with a fondness for drinking. Though the entire ensemble operates as a well-oiled machine, it feels like distracting stunt casting. Equally disjointed is the timeline of the film which clocks in at three-hours. Nolan has chosen to piece the film together out of chronological order, sometimes whipping between pre- and post-bomb at a clip, switching from colour to black-and-white. It doesn’t make the narrative hard to follow, but instead, the frequent cutting doesn’t give scenes enough time to breathe, lessening their impact on the audience. Though decently well-paced, the climax of the film is undoubtedly the desert Trinity test of the bomb capabilities which is a standout moment. Arriving at around the two-hour mark, what makes this whole sequence of events stand out is that Nolan gives it time to build tension and unfold in front of the audience instead of time-hopping to the next scene. Oppenheimer is definitely worth the price of admission to see it on the big screen. It will undoubtedly be a player this awards season with Murphy getting some well-deserved recognition. But Nolan’s best? I’ll reserve that achievement for his future work. "
"Aug 29, 2023",positive," “Oppenheimer” es una película formidable, caracterizada por un opulento estilo audiovisual, el despliegue espectacular de recursos cinematográficos (música, fotografía, efectos especiales, montaje), actuaciones notables y convincentes (a cargo de una pléyade de estrellas y talentos de primer nivel, incluso en roles secundarios), y una narración construida sobre la base del paralelismo y la simultaneidad a diversos niveles de sentido (tanto dramáticos como audiovisuales); todo con una intensidad que se aproxima al límite de lo soportable, pero consistente con el contexto histórico en el que transcurre la obra y la tarea encomendada al protagonista principal.  Dirigido por el gran director británico Christopher Nolan, el filme es un biopic con elementos de thriller judicial sobre Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), un famoso físico teórico estadounidense, considerado “el padre de la bomba atómica”. Lo presenta desde sus tempranos estudios universitarios en Cambridge hasta su nombramiento para dirigir la construcción en secreto de la fatídica arma (el Proyecto Manhattan) y las consecuencias que ello le acarreó. Pero este ámbito narrativo es solo el aspecto externo de su vida; al mismo tiempo, los complejos factores externos alimentan los internos. En esa línea, el director explora a fondo sus dilemas morales, procedentes de su vida privada y trabajo científico, los que se van acumulando hasta convertirse en uno central y el verdadero eje de la película. Nolan busca reivindicar la figura del ilustre científico y limpiarlo definitivamente de las falsas acusaciones de las que fue víctima durante la “cacería de brujas” en el macartismo, en la época de la Guerra Fría, debido a sus tempranas simpatías con el comunismo. Sin embargo, no llega a ser propiamente una cinta apologética, ya que –junto a la evidencia de su genio científico y profesional– se muestra con detalle sus defectos, errores, contradicciones e indecisiones finales; de tal forma que los factores internos, derivados de su personalidad, también provocan consecuencias en el ámbito externo, al más alto nivel. Cabe precisar que estas indagaciones –en las que se presentaban evidencias y se brindaban testimonios a cargo de testigos– no eran exactamente juzgamientos, sino entrevistas de carácter político en dos coyunturas distintas (la primera, durante el maccartismo y la segunda, posterior a ese periodo). Pese a que los interrogadores eventualmente utilizaban tácticas judiciales, en ambos casos no había “carga de la prueba” para la toma de decisión; sino que se trataba de evaluaciones políticas (la del Congreso, al ser propuesto Strauss como Secretario de Comercio por el presidente Eisenhower) o presuntamente referidas a seguridad nacional (en el caso de Oppenheimer en las audiencias ante la junta de seguridad). Entre estas dos líneas está la tercera (a manera de flashbacks), donde se cuenta prácticamente casi toda la vida adulta de Oppenheimer hasta sus actividades posteriores a la ejecución del proyecto Manhattan y el reconocimiento final durante el gobierno de Lyndon B. Johnson. Más aun, su biografía es desmenuzada con mucho detalle a través de estas indagaciones oficiales; una, la de la junta, destinada desacreditarlo y, la otra –congresal–, a evaluar la actuación de Strauss en relación con el proceso de la citada junta. Generándose una interacción constante en la cual los distintos episodios biográficos son introducidos, comentados, discutidos, evaluados y anticipados –ocasionalmente, desde más de un punto de vista– entre estas dos líneas narrativas hasta el mismo desenlace de la cinta.  Aunque la película es a color, toda la segunda línea ha sido filmada en blanco y negro, ya que aquí no solo se expone el punto de vista de Strauss, sino que también se sugiere el “lado oscuro” del entorno institucional, así como se muestra la transformación del personaje y, con ello, un importante giro argumental; y, más allá del punto de vista, se avanza hasta el propio clímax dramático de toda la obra. De tal forma que las dos líneas tipo interrogatorio –“incrustadas” a la tercera– son diferenciadas por la fotografía, aunque se terminan por integrar a esta última; es decir, son parte de una sola sucesión cronológica biográfica. En tal sentido, otro punto fascinante en esta estructura tripartita son los descalces temporales. La tercera línea empieza alrededor de 1920 y se desarrolla casi linealmente hasta 1963; mientras que la indagación de la junta fue en 1954 y la reunión del comité del congreso fue en 1959. No obstante, las tres están articuladas de forma casi cronológica por lo que en realidad todo transcurre linealmente, pese a que las dos pesquisas ocurren en años distintos.  De esta forma, sobre la estructura cronológica se monta otra estructura narrativa que retrocede del “futuro” (años 50, en distintos momentos) al “pasado” (años 20) para atrapar y desarrollar hacia adelante, en una maniobra de pinzas (léase acompañamiento e interacción narrativas), la acción y –luego del clímax– llevarla hasta el desenlace, en los años 60.  Toda esta compleja operación de sentido con los tiempos tiene como uno de sus objetivos extractar de la secuencia biográfica los dos episodios tipo interrogatorio y, dentro de este espacio fragmentado, plantear y resolver los dos grandes asuntos de esta película: el conflicto de personalidades entre Oppenheimer y Strauss (en el episodio congresal) y el dilema moral del protagonista principal (en las audiencias de la junta de seguridad). Para entender completamente el conflicto externo (con Strauss) y analizar el interno (del Oppenheimer), pasamos a examinar la tercera línea narrativa en el marco de esa única sucesión lineal. Estas tensiones se desarrollan de manera casi totalmente lineal durante el recuento biográfico, empezando por su paso por distintas universidades, sus relaciones con Einstein (Tom Conti) y otros físicos famosos (Niels Bohr / Kenneth Branagh, Werner Heisenberg / Mattias Schwaighöffer) y culminando con su nombramiento para dirigir el proyecto Manhattan e incorporación de los científicos para el proyecto.  Entre las tensiones externas sobre Oppenheimer tenemos las que se generan por sus relaciones y apoyo a iniciativas comunistas (en la academia y en el proyecto) y su lealtad a la autoridad militar y de seguridad estadounidense. Luego, las que surgen de su relación recurrente con su amante, la siquiatra Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), causadas por la enfermedad mental de ella; y, posteriormente, entre esta relación y las tensiones con su esposa, la bióloga Katherine Puening (Emily Blunt), por este y otros asuntos. Ambas fueron comunistas, así como su amigo Haakon Chevalier (Jefferson Hall) y su propio hermano Frank (Dylan Arnold) a quien involucró directamente en “Trinity” (nombre clave de la prueba de la primera bomba atómica en el desierto de Los Alamos, New Mexico); lo que le generaría serios problemas, tanto entonces como posteriormente, aunque nunca se inscribió en el partido.  A estos se añaden los conflictos generados dentro del equipo del proyecto Manhattan, por la exigencia militar de secrecía y compartimentalización, y los obstáculos que ello planteaba para el trabajo científico interdisciplinario, el que requería forzosamente información compartida. Así como el debate sobre la bomba de hidrógeno con quien sería su creador, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) y con William Borden (David Dastmalchian); quienes ofrecerían testimonios decisivos ante la junta de seguridad. Para no hablar de las tensiones con el general Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), constructor del Pentágono y jefe militar del proyecto y otras, menores, en sus relaciones más puntuales con los científicos resueltamente opuestos a la bomba como Leo Szilard (Maté Haumann) y David Hill (Ramy Malek); entre otros. En consecuencia, lo que podría haber sido un soso recuento biográfico se convierte en una sucesión de secuencias repletas de relaciones fascinantes y episodios interesantes, sorprendentes y reveladores sobre el protagonista. Pero, sobre todo, estas tensiones –de personalidad, sentimentales, políticas, profesionales y científicas– están conectadas entre sí y crean una fuerte intensificación dramática, que solo se reduce tras el éxito de “Trinity”. Aunque, de todas maneras, alcanza para hacer tolerable y hasta potenciar los momentos de máxima presión en las audiencias de la junta de seguridad, hacia el final de la cinta. El encadenamiento de tensiones de todo tipo que mencionamos en el ámbito de la acción externa del protagonista se repite también –aunque de manera más limitada– en el ámbito interno; es decir, en la mente de Oppenheimer y se muestra a través de imagen y sonido. Lo que nos conducirá a un nuevo plano de sentido construido a partir del montaje y la banda sonora. De hecho, la primera imagen de la película pertenece a la tercera línea narrativa y es simbólica (como varias más y muy significativas), tanto en lo interno como en lo externo, impactando sobre la conciencia de Oppenheimer. Muestra la caída de unas gotas de lluvia y las ondas que genera en un arroyo; imagen que reaparecería al final del filme, simbolizando la posibilidad de una guerra nuclear, la que es representada –con sutileza– en otra imagen (alrededor de la mitad de la obra) que ilustra mediante las columnas de humo, las “crestas” de lo que sería tal hecatombe, todo entre nubes blancas sobre un cielo azul.  Aquí debemos mencionar el papel del montaje, pues ya hemos reseñado las constantes intercalaciones entre las tres líneas narrativas, a los que deben añadirse también los numerosos insertos del contexto científico (imágenes que pretenden ilustrar elementos de la física cuántica, fisiones y fusiones nucleares, y hasta los hallazgos del protagonista, referidos a la trayectoria de luz desde las estrellas) y de sus relaciones o consecuencias en el arte (“Tierra baldía” de Eliot, “Consagración de la primavera” de Stravinsky, cubismo por Picasso); estas últimas, además, informan sobre el interés (no desarrollado en el filme) de Oppenheimer por temas artísticos.  Más adelante, cuando logra el éxito en la prueba de la primera bomba atómica, empieza a ver desintegrarse a las personas que lo aplauden y celebran, como si fueran víctimas del artefacto nuclear; él mismo alucina que su pie está atascado en un cuerpo carbonizado por la explosión. Durante toda la película no hay una sola imagen que muestre la destrucción causada en Hiroshima y Nagasaki por obra de la bomba fabricada por Oppenheimer; en cambio, esas imágenes tormentosas estaban en su mente y no es casual que aparezcan con fuerza en sus momentos de mayor gloria y reconocimiento, marcando su quiebre emocional. Estas imágenes parecen (y son) obvias, pero no tanto. La película no desarrolla el hecho de que Oppenheimer padecía problemas mentales (fue diagnosticado por esquizofrenia a los 14 años y se conocen episodios de impulsividad seriamente agresivos). Nuevamente, la cinta no amplía estos asuntos, pero sí coloca estas escenas ambiguamente alucinatorias o el episodio con la manzana en Cambridge, que si bien no profundizan en estas facetas sí se correlacionan con los rasgos de personalidad del protagonista que se muestran en la cinta. No estamos, pues, ante insertos efectistas o barroquismo gratuito. Todas las imágenes están perfectamente justificadas, son momentos de un proceso narrativo audiovisual coherente y pleno de sentido, destinados a mostrar el fuero interno de Oppenheimer.  Pero también aparece, en conexión con esas imágenes iniciales de la física, el mito de Prometeo (en alusión al título de la biografía en la que está basada la película) y que relata cómo este titán inmortal roba el fuego a los dioses para entregarlo a los hombres y que estos se beneficien, siendo castigado por Zeus a vivir encadenado a una roca junto al mar y sufrir diariamente el ataque de un águila que le devora las entrañas. Como ser inmortal, Prometeo no podía morir y su carne se regeneraba durante la noche; volviendo al día siguiente el ave para devorarlo y reiniciar esta feroz tortura cotidiana.  Pero hay otros tres componentes cinematográficos fundamentales para sostener el trabajo de montaje. Uno es la banda sonora que –como en otras obras de Nolan– aporta un tono épico a la vez que amenazante a lo largo de todo el metraje. La monumentalidad y grandilocuencia de algunos fragmentos está totalmente justificada porque la música soporta un proceso creativo destinado a reconstituir, mediante la ficción, la verdad histórica sobre un hecho –además– trascendental para la humanidad.  De otro lado, la partitura de Ludwig Göransson es sumamente eficaz, en parte porque sigue los parámetros de Hans Zimmer, su antecesor en otras cintas de Nolan, pero también por momentos muy logrados; como, ejemplo, la tortuosa música que acompaña el siniestro diálogo entre el protagonista, el coronel Boris Pash (Casey Affleck) y otro oficial de inteligencia, en paralelo con otra conversa entre Oppenheimer y Grovers, al respecto. Este es un caso del magistral juego de varios puntos de vista –tres– en simultáneo, pero también de que al interior de la tercera línea narrativa se producen paralelismos adicionales a los de las dos primeras líneas (y algún cambio temporal).  De otro lado, el manejo de la dinámica en la banda sonora y el uso oportuno del silencio en esta cinta tan dialogada, en pared con similar procedimiento con las imágenes en el montaje trae un resultado audiovisual sobresaliente por su virtuosismo, consistencia narrativa, fluidez en el avance de la acción e interacción entre los ámbitos interno y externo de Oppenheimer. Esto nos conduce al segundo componente destacado en esta puesta en escena: el suspenso. Las numerosas tensiones, intensificación y conflictos dramáticos se potencian con las múltiples operaciones de sentido entre imagen y sonido en el montaje, siendo el resultado una sensación de suspenso casi permanente, que no da tregua al espectador y no lo suelta (sino que lo tiene atento, intrigado y excitado) hasta el final de la película. Aunque sabemos perfectamente que “Trinity” fue exitosa y que se produjeron efectivamente los ataques nucleares a Hiroshima y Nagasaki (y aún si no lo conociéramos), queremos saber cómo se llegó a eso, los entretelones de estas decisiones. Y lo mismo en relación con los múltiples avatares biográficos del protagonista.  La labor actoral de ambos intérpretes (y la del resto del reparto) es sobresaliente. Cillian Murphy, aparte de cambios físicos, consigue una caracterización muy lograda de la soberbia y carácter retraído del personaje; así como de su envidiable tranquilidad y fuerza para vencer obstáculos sobre la base de su genio e inteligencia (y cosechar, de paso, a una tropa de enemigos poderosos).  Pero también para mostrar las crecientes vulnerabilidades de Oppenheimer y su gradual declive emocional en las audiencias de la junta; hasta concentrar bajo la forma de un bloqueo, en el clímax del interrogatorio de la junta, los factores contradictorios en las que estuvo envuelta su vida y, especialmente, su gran logro: la bomba atómica.  Robert Downey Jr., por su parte, compone convincentemente a un Strauss sibilino, que se rinde ante la inteligencia de Oppenheimer pero es incapaz de superar su propia mezquindad (aunque también obedeciendo a intereses políticos); pero esto solo lo advertimos cuando –gracias al contraste de más de un punto de vista y en el bloque final– vemos un resumen de la sutileza con que el personaje encaja las varias afrentas involuntarias de su subordinado, un genio con carencias de inteligencia emocional, en distintos momentos.  Emily Blunt encarna a una mujer dura y endurecida por las frustraciones políticas y sus consecuencias posteriores, así como las personales, en relación (por épocas, tormentosa) con su marido; antes y después de la bomba. Aunque es fácil adivinar el trasfondo, uno se queda con las ganas de conocer más de Kitty, tal es la fuerza combativa que transmite la interpretación de la actriz.  Con la revisión de los principales componentes de esta puesta en escena ya podemos advertir su vasto alcance estético e histórico. Quizás lo más llamativo es cómo se cruza el avance casi cronológico de la acción con la fragmentación creada a través de los montajes paralelos y cómo la historia se va relatando por intercalación de diversos puntos de vista, muchas veces complementarios y/o de manera simultánea.  De tal forma que tenemos una narración lineal y fragmentaria a la vez, donde lo sincrónico (la sucesión de hechos y personajes, el auge y caída de Oppenheimer) convive con lo diacrónico (debates científicos, sospechas políticas y creciente dilema moral). Todo ello apoyado por un despliegue espectacular de recursos audiovisuales, que apoyan una estructura dramática perfectamente ensamblada, con harto suspenso y menos compleja que otras películas de este director.  En cierta forma, la imagen inicial de la película –las gotas de lluvia que producen ondas en un arroyo– no solo simboliza uno de los contenidos fundamentales de la película, sino también su propia estructura audiovisual. Así, las gotas serían las líneas narrativas paralelas, mientras que las ondas serían los distintos puntos de vista (en momentos y personajes distintos) que se intersectan. De tal manera que, aunque estemos siguiendo un relato lineal, al mismo tiempo, Nolan nos lo presenta como si estuviera ocurriendo en otros y muy distantes momentos, ¡y ambas cosas son ciertas! Estamos, pues ante una obra maestra cinematográfica, en la que podemos acceder y disfrutar una exhibición de virtuosismo audiovisual y dramático del más elevado nivel, así como un conjunto organizado de sentidos que nos devuelven un episodio histórico de vigencia en el presente y trascendencia para el futuro. Altamente recomendable.  Nota: Para quienes estén interesados en la supuesta competencia entre la Alemania nazi y los Estados Unidos para construir la bomba atómica, dato mencionado en la película, aunque no desarrollado e históricamente discutible, pueden leer “En busca de Klingsor”, la notable novela de  Jorge Volpi. Mientras que para el encuentro real entre Niels Bohr y Werner Heisenberg durante la guerra y en territorio controlado por los nazis, asunto materia de una fugaz mención, como posibilidad, en “Oppenheimer”, se puede visionar “Copenhagen”, película británica que ensaya una aproximación al tema de la competencia entre ambas potencias en torno a la bomba."
"Aug 26, 2023",positive," Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers; his attention to detail, tone, acting, production sets, and sound is always a delight. “Inception” (2010), “The Dark Knight”(2008), “Dunkirk” (2017), and “The Dark Knight Rises”(2012) come to mind when I look back on his memorable films. He’s set the bar high for himself by tackling Robert Oppenheimer’s life as an experimental physicist who ended up creating the atomic bomb and taking the blame for its horrendous results. His casting of Cillian Murphy, known for “Peaky Blinders” British TV series 2013, was a brilliant choice as his nuanced performance is exceptional. I enjoyed this historical film immensely and have forgiven its three-hour run-time, as to have an up close and personal look at history in the making is indeed a treat. Based on the 2005 Pulitzer Price-winning biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film unfolds in two separate ways; the black-and-white sections detail the ‘past’ struggles of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) in a fantastic portrayal, to be confirmed as Secretary of Commerce. He’s interrogated about his former support of Oppenheimer, who was controversial as of 1959. He would become the first candidate denied approval if his answers didn’t satisfy the Senate committee members. We are privy to his constant badgering and the seriousness of his past actions. The color sections show Oppenheimer’s life, most notably his torrid affair with Communist Party USA member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his somewhat unsteady marriage to his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt). The development of the atomic bomb is the main focus, as well as his constant conflicts and alliances with Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves (Matt Damon). We also learn of the building of a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where scientists will live and work while the bomb is perfected to test the bomb there eventually. The color and black and white scenes are flashbacks simultaneously as Oppenheimer is being interrogated by a special committee that will decide if his security clearance will be renewed. Yes, this is a lot to take in a while viewing a film, although soon, the pace allows for settling in with expectations of the following scenes. Of course, the cornerstone is the actual assembly and testing of the atomic bomb. The supporting cast gives an incredible performance, an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey, Jr. as Strauss departs from himself to totally embody his character. Florence Pugh’s role as the needy yet unstable other woman is fascinating to view. Yes, they have steamy love scenes, although they are important as we begin to see the conflicted moral compass of a genius, the total portrait of a human being. He has his hands full, appeasing his wife, Emily Blunt, as she’s scored yet, faithful, filling her anger and jealousy with binge drinking. Her volatile yet loving relationship with Oppenheimer is well-developed and intriguing to view. Nolan does achieve his goal of relentless ticking-clock suspense in how he approaches the movie overall. Each scene is played for full dramatic effect, especially in the race to build an A-bomb before Nazi Germany does. When the final test occurs, the sound is what stays with me—the stop-motion of history before us is chilling in his spot-on timing and visual effects. Look for an Academy Award for sound; no other movie can top it. As I have written and taught a unit of study of Albert Einstein and his contribution to the making of the atomic bomb, I appreciated the in-depth portrait of Oppenheimer, including his early beginnings in his college years. We are privy to his psyche and his personality as Nolan sets up scenes as if to dare us to predict how Oppenheimer will react. After three hours of viewing, you will understand this person and his drive for success. I can highly recommend it as you’ll learn a wealth of information while being artfully entertained."
"Aug 26, 2023",positive," Julius Robert Oppenheimer, quoting from Bhagavad Gita, made these words infamous when he uttered them. The theoretical physicist became known as the “father of the atomic bomb” after being the director for the Los Alamos Laboratory, which assisted with the Manhattan Project under Major General Leslie Groves during WWII. The bombs created led to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer eventually feared the further creation and use of atomic weapons. His stances and past associations with Communist members led to the revocation of his security clearance, staining his character for some.  All of this and more is captured in Christopher Nolan’s 3-hour biopic Oppenheimer. It’s a mostly brilliant, occasionally exhausting picture that moves ten miles a minute and is filled with wall-to-wall dialogue. It is indeed Nolan’s most talky film, with the conversations often accompanied by Ludwig Göransson’s rich but overused music score. Nolan frames the film with Oppy’s security clearance meetings and a cabinet hearing for Lewis Strauss while detailing Oppenheimer’s personal life and the Manhattan Project at the center. The film covers a lot of ground, but Nolan’s intelligent writing (based on the 2005 book American Prometheus) and Jennifer Lame’s precise editing help ameliorate the more convoluted sections.  The cast of big-name stars is huge, with the great Cillian Murphy leading the way as the title character. His performance here ranks among his best as he shows Oppenheimer’s struggles and successes expertly. Murphy’s eyes do a lot of acting while the others’ mouths are moving.  Matt Damon plays Groves with some humorous touches while Emily Blunt plays Katherine, Oppenheimer’s alcoholic wife, with fierceness. Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock, who Oppenheimer had an on-again-off-again relationship with. Robert Downey Jr. dominates the last hour of the film as Strauss, turning in the most memorable supporting performance in the film. The rest of the shiny cast includes – deep breath – Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Jack Quaid, Tom Conti, Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, Gary Oldman, and Matthew Modine, just to name a few.  Being a Nolan film, the production aspects are very impressive. Oppenheimer was shot on IMAX 65 mm film by Hoyte van Hoytema and the film used little to no CGI according to Nolan. The images and practical effects are simply astounding at times, especially during the Trinity test scene; the sound design during that section is expertly done too as silence is as important as the boom. The subtle old-age makeup used throughout is also excellent.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC. You should check us out on our social channels, subscribe to our newsletter, and tell your friends.

"Aug 25, 2023",positive," Robert Horton is a Scarecrow board member and a longtime film critic. He will be contributing a series of ""critic's notes"" to the Scarecrow blog—a chance to highlight worthy films playing locally and connecting them to the riches of Scarecrow's collection. In the three-hour rush of Oppenheimer, writer-director Christopher Nolan takes time to include an early scene of the title character gazing at a Picasso. The painting (Woman Sitting with Crossed Arms, 1937) deconstructs reality and reassembles it in a fresh way, forcing us to think anew about its subject, perhaps confronting us with an assertion that the old ways of seeing are not enough anymore. Or, Picasso echoes quantum physics by breaking the image apart and exposing it as a collection of pieces. The nucleus no longer holds. We don't know what is going on in the head of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he gazes; the film wants us to understand that JRO responds to the fragmentation of early 20th century art, citing also The Waste Land and Stravinsky. Maybe he has the wistful yearning of a scientist who wishes he were an artist. I suppose it's too easy to pin this moment as autobiographical, but after all Nolan is a highly cerebral director of films that deconstruct cinema in clinical ways: a noir told backward, a World War II story that evolves in parallel but inexact lines, a story of manufactured dreams built like a nesting doll. Excited young cineastes like to call Nolan this generation's Stanley Kubrick, but he's really David Lean turned inside out, a master of spectacle, one who can't resist disassembling the pieces of the spectacle and pondering their individual parts. (And like Lean, the observations at the heart of the spectacle tend to be of the mid-brow variety.) The New Yorker's Richard Brody called Oppenheimer ""a History Channel movie,"" a puzzling description of a relentlessly experimental project.* Maybe Brody was thinking of the film's tendency to put its cinematic zest in service of some incorrigibly cornball moments (""What do we call the first atomic test?"" ""Let us call it … Trinity,"" or words to that portentous effect). Otherwise, Oppenheimer is shaped as an experience, an onslaught of sound and image and ideas, arranged musically. Although it has one very loud bomb going off halfway through, most of it consists of people talking in rooms, yet Nolan presents the film as a roller coaster ride, throbbing with Ludwig Göransson's score—which, with Nolan's usual cavalier attitude toward dialogue comprehension, thoroughly fuzzes what people are saying at various points—and darting in and out of color. Do we learn much about J. Robert Oppenheimer? Not really, not biographically, not spiritually. This is not the fault of Cillian Murphy, whose haunted eyes beneath the deftly-deployed hat were made for this kind of existentially conflicted role, although—and this is sheer historical prejudice on my part—I could never get used to seeing Oppenheimer as a short man; the real Oppenheimer's lanky tallness had to have been part of his rather lofty, dreamy personality. Oppenheimer is not a character study but a political film, a look at the back-and-forth of government process, from the building of the bomb to the security-clearance hearing that Oppenheimer had to endure in the 1950s when his leftist sentiments made him suspect during the Red-baiting era. In its structurally bizarre final hour, which crosscuts between Oppenheimer's security investigation and a later cabinet-appointment hearing for Oppie nemesis Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), Nolan gives us the American nightmare and a more upbeat example of justice being served, however obscure Strauss might now be as a historical figure. On the latter point, Nolan is surely catching the zeitgeist feeling/fantasy that something, at long last, might happen to the 45th U.S. president, something like accountability. I don't doubt that the energetic whoosh with which Nolan puts all this across is genuine excitement on his part about making these events come to cinematic life, although they are also more than a little exhausting. Oppenheimer might be less taxing if its points weren't so exactly and precisely worked out. With Nolan, things are on the nose, with only occasional spots of mystery and uncertainty (like the brief, dangerous intensity of Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's sometime girlfriend, or the suggestion from Niels Bohr [Kenneth Branagh] that Oppie should metaphorically ""hear the music"" rather than just read notation.) Even the film's excursions into expressionism, like a triumphal post-Hiroshima talk Oppenheimer gives to his Manhattan Project colleagues—where his can-do words contrast with visions of melting faces and nightmare sounds—are so carefully calculated that they have the exact meaning Nolan wants them to have, and nothing else. Nolan's style tends to reduce things to a simple idea, no matter how complicated his time-arrangements or aspect ratios are. Being able to articulate exact meanings isn't a negligible talent, and so the film is often engaging. The room where the security hearing takes place is one of Nolan's best conceptions, a weirdly cramped, rectangular, featureless chamber where the deck is stacked against the onetime American hero. Like the climactic scene in Barbie between doll and inventor (see, I found a way to connect the two films), the space is a pale sort of void, a purgatory. Here Oppenheimer will be grilled (mostly by an Atomic Energy Commission counsel, played by Jason Clarke) and defended (Macon Blair—such a human presence—is his attorney), his wife (Emily Blunt) will hear him talk about infidelities, and his wary military partner Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) will shun him as Oppie sits off to the side, disappearing in space. The room is like one of those places in your dreams where the dimensions are wrong, a recurring location of threat and confinement. There is so much on the table in Oppenheimer that Nolan's habit of settling for neat conclusions is especially disappointing. It is a noble try, an interesting experience, and an absolutely fascinating example of the director as superstar (a movie about a mid-century scientist had an $80 million opening weekend?!?). As to the post-opening-weekend comments that the film glosses over the effects of the bombing of Japan in favor of white man angst: It's tempting to say that those complaints are from people who didn't see the movie, except that in this era you can actually see the movie and still bend it to your purpose. No, there is no documentary footage of Hiroshima. And yet, Oppenheimer is deliberate about conjuring horror. During that aforementioned Oppie ""victory"" speech, there's a single tortured scream that cracks out of the audio mix, a hallucination that justifies Nolan's complicated sound design. It sears your brain. I said these three hours are exhausting, partly because they are so crammed with things, but ultimately there is blunt power in those things: equations, hats, screams."
"Aug 24, 2023",positive," Perhaps under slightly different circumstances, this would not have quite as volatile of a reaction. The announcement of two different, disparate movies would have just been an odd curiosity rather than a cultural phenomenon that would capture the imagination of tens of thousands. The juxtaposition was just too staggering. In one corner of the world, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenhiemer. His first movie in three years, an epic three-hour biopic about the creation of the atomic bomb. An in the other corner, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie. A live action fever dream whose trailers and promotional material seem to belie any sort of tethering with anything we’d ever known. And both of these movies coming out on the same day? July 21 was doubled marked from the get. But for some, myself included, this cosmic alignment, the cinematic syzygy meant only one thing. An fantatical film run. A double feature of the highest order I had done as an adult. Now, the history books (by which I mean the Wikipedia article), pormanteau’ed the names as Barbenheimer, a name I never quite agreed with because it did not reflect what I viewed the proper viewing order. As I planned the grueling gauntlet, I determined early on that the only correct approach would be to sit through the dark, harrowing existentialism of Nolan’s Oppenhimer and then immediately go into bubblegum pop existentialism of Gerwig’s Barbie as a form of cultural/experiential cold shock that would stagger me into an upswing. It was a bit, but a bit that I was committed to. I began prosteylizing the work. Trying to rally others to the theater for the deed. Many scoffed at the thought, but I convinced folks to undertake the journey that I felt my cause, my crusade noble. I sent word to my friends and associates (The marketing tools made this very easy). While I could not secure time to watch on the 21st, the 22nd would work just the same. A 10:30 showing of Oppenhiemer on the biggest screen I could find, followed immediately by a 2:10 showing of Barbie on a slightly smaller screen. I must warn you of what comes next now. There are spoilers in this text. Unknowable secrets that you could very well find knowable, but if I am to talk of the Oppenharbie, I must be able to talk free of what I witnessed. I managed to go in unadulterated with knowledge, but that was because of the temporal proximity. I imagine it might be more difficult now, but I do not wish to contribute to the demystification if it can be helped. AS FATE AS DEMANDED, THE DARK MAGNUM OPUS OF CHRISTOPHER NOLAN AND THE FEVER DREAM THAT IS LIVE ACTION BARBIE ARE COMING OUT THE SAME DAY.THE BIT I, AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, HAVE MADE SINCE THIS FORBIDDEN REVELATION IS COMING TO FRUITION. IT IS TIME TO SIT IN A MOVIE THEATER FOR SIX HOURS AND BE BOMBARDED IN SEVERAL SENSES OF THE WORD. I made the drive to the Alamo Drafthouse, a relatively new fixture in my hometown. The drive was uneventful, and I walked into the theater with perhaps a tad bit of glee at the wild undertaking. This particular Alamo Draftouse has an elaborate pre-show, so I sit in the massive theater. The experience starts with footage from various atomic bomb PSAs: times where we were informed that hiding under a desk could shield us from the effects of one of the worst weapons in human history. This is immediately followed by a base level analysis of Nolan’s entire library of works, cataloging various trends like TROUBLED PROTAGONISTS and trends like MEMORY and MORALITY. As I settled in the comfy recliner, I put in an order for a breakfast BLT, which is like a regular BLT but with an egg and fries. It’s pricy, but I figured that if there was ever a time to spend money it would be during a day where I am in a dark theater for upwards of six hours. I see a few people rocking Barbenheimer merchandise, a couple outfits melding bright pink and drab grey. I emboldened by having fellow travelers (although I do wonder how many are actively foolish as I am). The movie finally starts. In typical Nolan fashion, the narrative isn’t exactly linear. We start with Fission, a polychromatic journey that follows Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, and quickly are introduced to Fusion, a monochromatic political inquiry that follows Robert Downy Jr’s Strauss many years after the creation of the bomb. We bounce back and forth between these two eras that encircle a war happening off screen. I learn a fair bit about Oppenheimer during the movie. His political leanings, his womanizing tendencies, his preference to theory. It is the most exhilarating and harrowing story about scientists I’ve seen in a minute, with a cast of staggering renown bringing the story to life. All of it culminating to the test of the bomb. Nolan lets the explosion visual splendor revel in the silence. The sound comes minutes later and the film barrels through the political aftermath that follows, including a joke about Kyoto narrowly avoiding destruction because someone had their honeymoon there. The movie’s audiovisual bombardment leaves me emotionally raw. There are no end credits (or perhaps, I was already living in the post-credits of a post-nuclear globe), so I tip my server, collect myself, and then immediately walk to the other theater. The fugue state set in pretty much immediately as I settled into the second theater. The server asks how I’m doing and I relay that I just watched Oppenheimer. I recollect how I have certainly made a decision as I order a brussels sprout, bacon, and goat cheese pizza. This pre-show features what I have to imagine is every single Barbie commercial from the past 30 some years. It culminates with an aggressive doll doing a PSA about talking in the theater, and I’m not ready for what’s about to happen. I noticed a few folks from the Oppenhiemer showing; although at this point, I’m at hour three of sensory bombardment so I don’t know if I can trust my senses. Especially since what happens next is Barbie opens with the 2001: Space Odyssey spot, and I thought that was an incredible ad spot when I first saw, but to see it actually start the movie was something that shook me to my already shooketh core. I settle in for the gauntlet of Barbies (McKinnon, Rae, Shipp, Mackey, Nef, Rooney, Kayne, Ayra, Gouglan, Narrative, Abela, Boynton) and Ken (Gosling, Liu, Ben-Adir, Evans, Gatwa, Cena, Brydon, Stourton).  I enjoyed seeing so many members of Netflix’s Sex Education that I actively wonder where Asa Butterfield is. I enjoyed seeing America Ferrera as a Mattell employee and mom, desperately missing her as Amy from Superstore. Will Ferrell essentially reprising his roll from The Lego Movie is fine, that’s not really the point. I watched Michael Cera’s Allan absolutely destroy Kens in hand-to-hand combat. I burst out laughing as all the Kens play a rousing rendition of Matchbox Twenty’s 90’s classic “Push,” and the song creates a thousand new associations because of how it fits so perfectly and serves as a prelude to the other magnificent musical number. The story is simple and sweet. There is no room for deep nuance, but there is nuance. An acknowledgement of the contradictory standards, an everlasting fear of never being enough, and wanting more. As the movie ends, I smiled. I also struggled to stand after being stationary for five and half hours out the last six.  The sun was blinding as I exited the Alamo Drafthouse. The summer heat was sweltering. I walked slowly to my car and drive home in silence, thinking of the dual existentialism films that I put in conversation with each other, only to find a staggering amount of dialog of creation, capitalism, and human connection. I got home and was stunned, and in the fugue state, voraciously needed something to snap me back to a more tethered state. Thankfully, the universe provides, and Prime announced that ahead of the second season of Invincible, they released a special origin story for Atomic Eve. I was mesmerized by the moment, the sheer genius of releasing an episode of a pink haired protagonist with the ability to manipulating atoms the same day as Oppenhiemer/Barbie. It was clear though that was I was a changed person. Experiencing Oppenharbie had irrevocably changed me. I’m not sure I’d say either was my favorite movie, but I can say safely say it was one of the best cinematic experiences I’d ever done. Even got my own T-shirt for it."
"Aug 24, 2023",positive," In a way, Christopher Nolan’s three-hour, shot-in-IMAX historical docudrama epic entitled Oppenheimer isn’t really about J. Robert Oppenheimer at all. Yes, even though it’s full of extreme closeups of the anguished scientist and much figurative rending of garments over his role in the creation of our modern world in which an atomic sword of Damocles hangs over us all. I mean, obviously, yes, the film does focus on the theoretical physicist, the man who led the United States’ secret program during World War II to develop an atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy (A Quiet Place: Part II, The Party) as the scientist is mesmerizing, conveying calamitous inner turmoil while remaining still and modulated on the surface, even when his lack of apparent reaction damages him. This can only be called a pointillistic portrait, one full of staccato visuals that hit rapid-fire but also somehow lazily, not least as Nolan switches from often intensely hued — indeed, fiery hued — color images depicting Oppenheimer’s subjective experience of his life and work, to cooler, calmer black-and-white to show the external, more objective reality in which he operates. (There’s a lot going on in this film, on so many levels, but I suspect entire theses will be written alone about the distinction Nolan makes here between personal emotional and intellectual experience as more vivid to the individual [obviously?] versus the drier, more distant, more neutral impartiality of everything outside of ourselves… and the limits of that, too, since it can only be cast through subjective eyes such as those of a filmmaker or a historian. This movie is a darker, grimmer, film-stock-flipped Wizard of Oz, and way more existential, dreaminess turned deadly actuality. Not that Oz didn’t have its own grimdark existentialism, of course.) Nolan (Tenet, Dunkirk) casts Oppenheimer as a man possessed by preternatural visions of the subatomic world, a strange reality that the mathematics says must exist but which he can see only in his imagination… and this is one of Nolan’s startling uses of IMAX. We’ve been trained to expect that IMAX pictures will capture the bigness of the world, but Nolan goes in the opposite direction here, zigzagging dots trailing light on the biggest movie screen we have suggesting the unfathomably minuscule realm far beneath our awareness. It’s like a buzzing in your ear of the universe’s tiniest unseen insects, hounding you to accept them even as you cannot comprehend them. (Nolan does go big with his pictures, too. His incredibly brief yet horrifyingly riveting impression of one worry that dogs the atomic scientists — would a runaway atomic reaction set off by a successful bomb ignite the planet’s atmosphere and Jesus fucking Christ they went ahead with it anyway — is perhaps the imagery that haunts me the most from the movie.) Yet as much as Nolan’s Oppenheimer is very much stuck in his own head, he can also be thoughtless and impulsive, giving in to urges without considering the consequences of them, from an itch to poison (what? yup!) a professor when he was at Cambridge university, to an ill-advised sexual situationship with a fellow pseudo-communist (Florence Pugh, goddess: Black Widow, Little Women) in the pre-war years, to a momentary lapse into wearing a military uniform that does not suit him in any way in the early days of the Manhattan Project. Nolan’s Oppenheimer can be very self-involved… to the point where you kinda wanna smack him out of it. Which his wife, played by a caustic Emily Blunt (Jungle Cruise, A Quiet Place: Part II) as a brilliant woman underappreciated by the world, almost literally does. (Ironically, or perhaps not, given his track record, Nolan underappreciates her character and the actress as well.) It comes in a moment where Oppenheimer is castigating himself for being, frankly, a huge jerk and suffering the consequences of this — in a personal capacity, not a military-industrial-scientific-complex one — and it’s almost the thematic centerpoint of the film. It’s echoed later, when in an astonishing one-scene cameo, Gary Oldman (The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, Darkest Hour) as US president Harry Truman berates the physicist as a “crybaby” for feeling as if he had “blood on his hands” after Hiroshima. Truman was the one who dropped the bomb(s), after all: Oppenheimer only made the bombs. There is a paradox at the nucleus of Oppenheimer. I don’t think Nolan has any intention of suggesting that Oppenheimer shouldn’t have felt guilty or responsible for what his work led to. It is and would be only human for him, for anyone, to do so. (Indeed, Ludwig Göransson’s [Creed II, Black Panther] aggressive score and the film’s relentlessly belligerent sound design, not to mention the overwhelming impact of the IMAX visuals that are both intimate and epic, ensure that we feel in a visceral way how tormented Oppenheimer is.) And yet the film projects what could be seen as, at worst, disdain for Oppenheimer’s pity-poor-me martyrdom. At best, Oppenheimer is dismissive of the notion, which the man himself as depicted here seems to hold, that Oppenheimer is solely to blame for the horrors that his atomic-bomb project unleashed. Because once the possibility of an atomic bomb was conceived of, someone was going to make it happen, certainly in the context of World War II. The whole point of the Manhattan Project was to build a bomb before the Nazis did. (The deeper question of why we seem, as a species, constitutionally driven to find the most violent, most destructive uses of our scientific knowledge is a philosophical conundrum for another film.) Truman’s point is well taken: No matter who built the bomb, it would be, and was, the politicians who decided when, where, and how to deploy it. And boy howdy, the character who represents that side of the equation is a doozy. Although much in the same way that the film isn’t really about Oppenheimer, it’s also not really about this other major figure either: Lewis Strauss, a former (as of 1959, the present-day of the film) Atomic Energy Commission head vying for a seat in US President Eisenhower’s cabinet. The film is structured as a series of nested flashbacks around Strauss’s confirmation hearings in the US Senate, which involve Oppenheimer because of the publicly and politically contentious professional relationship the men shared. Robert Downey Jr (Avengers: Endgame, The Judge), in his finest and most interesting performance since before Marvel, plays Strauss as a shallow, grasping functionary unaware of how absolutely useless he is, a contrast to Oppenheimer’s profound intellectualism but also a complement to the scientist’s self-involvement: Strauss is just as focused on himself as Oppenheimer is, if with far less self-awareness about it. Nolan mines extraordinary suspense from a simple exchange between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti: Paddington 2, The Dark Knight Rises) that Strauss witnesses but cannot overhear, during which Strauss believes Oppenheimer must have said something that soured Einstein on Strauss, because everything went to shit for Strauss after that, and what other reason could there be? (This leads directly to one of the many tiny, unsettling zingers of the film, a bit of snark from Alden Ehrenreich’s [Solo: A Star Wars Story, Hail, Caesar!] aide to Strauss about that mysterious exchange. Such an amazing ensemble cast in this film! Entire theses will be written about that, too.) When we at last hear that conversation — this final flashback is the closing scene of the film — it’s shocking for what is said, and also for what isn’t. It’s here when what Oppenheimer is about hits hard, and it is, once again, paradoxical: With the power to destroy ourselves unleashed — not just nukes but global warming, possibly AI, maybe genetic engineering, probably lots of other potential nightmares — how such awesome capability is used goes far beyond the acts of any one person, even the self-centered, self-involved men who think they make the world go round. And yet, when enough of them get together, even in opposition to one another, the tragedy is that they might actually make the world stop. Really well written review of the amazing and clearly Oscar worthy Oppenheimer, There is however one glaring oversight and that is the main deleterious motivation behind the creation of the bomb and that is  Male Hubris. I think this is truly the kingpin of this movie. Men cannot create life so they get off on destroying it! This is what all these male scientists in an almost collective orgasm demonstrate when the first bomb trial goes off! It is so hard to watch! There is only a brief view of two people throwing up but all the others are simply in a state of euphoria!! The few women, his lovers, in the film are the only ones that seem to fully comprehend the human ramifications. All the others just see male glory and male power! The male hubris at the basis of this destruction always has calamitous ramifications as Einstein so clearly states in the last scene! We Are All Doomed! I’d offer that the problem at its heart is capitalism, the military industrial complex, and on a more big picture scale, the problem is our society’s constant aspirations for affluence.
Both men and women, in my experience, put a good life in material terms far ahead of any concern about consequences like climate change or nuclear war. If particular men bear the blame for specific actions, that’s one thing, but our species does not seem to know restraint, regardless of gender.  Consider how Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are men, but Hillary Clinton was quite happy to see them prosecuted, and the military industrial complex enriched, during her time as Secretary of State. The US govt bureaucracy doesn’t care whether it’s Biden or Harris or Obama as the figurehead, just that American financial, political and military dominance across the world is maintained. That’s really what this animosity towards China and Russia, and the conflict and sanctions that’s resulted, is about. When I saw the trailer for Oppenheimer I immediately thought of its timing, during the Ukraine war, and potential for NATO vs Russian conflict. There’s very little if any discussion in the media about peace negotiations and ending the conflict. Do you ever wonder why that is? The US military-industrial complex consumes about $1 trillion (half of federal discretionary spending) and it would be fine with a forever war of the models of Iraq and Afghanistan: War is a business, and politics is the business of power, of which war, and weapon making, is a part. Living in Europe, I can assure you that there are many, many reasons for the lack of peace negotiations. A prominent one is that the Russian government would not accept them, unless Ukraine surrenders completely – nor would Ukraine, for obvious reasons. Unless the Russian notion changes completely, there will be no end of the conflict, and with Ukraine being harrassed like that, by now there is no certainty the war would end even if Russia retreated, from my point of view.
With some of us having the Russians literally at our doorstep, should Ukraine lose the war, there are still many people in Europe who don’t want negotiations on Russian terms, either.
Even though I completely agree with you with respect to the US military industrial complex , the war in Ukraine still is one in which the US have no say about whether to end it or not.
Or in other words, the US military industrial complex is not the only instance in the world waging war on someone. Even if they lost interest in this conflict completely, fighting would ensue, ad the parties involved have their own agenda, each. Marge, I have to respectfully disagree. There’s much evidence showing Russia’s desire for peace negotiations. In April 2022, just a month into the fighting, there were peace talks in Turkey that ended after UK’s Boris Johnson visited Zelensky: an agreement was being reached at that time.
Russia’s main demand is that Ukraine be neutral, not part of NATO, but Ukraine is repeatedly promised NATO membership.  If you believe Russia is the threat, not the US, I have to respect that. I would ask to you consider how honest mainstream media is, and also the history of the Maidan revolution (2014), the Minsk agreements (to stop civil war in the Donbas), and US involvement in that. It is not an accident Biden and his son Hunter are implicated in a corruption scandal with Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas corporation. Also, consider why were the Nord Stream pipelines bombed? Europe now has to depend partly on expensive liquid natural gas from the US, and German industry is re-locating outside the country: Europe is being de-industrialized by the loss of Nord Stream. Russia, in partnership with Europe and China represents an economic union that the US wanted to eliminate. Oh dear, I feel like now I understand why Caitlin Johnstone speaks to you. “Russia’s desire for peace negotiations”? Russia invaded a sovereign nation. If Russia wants peace, it can withdraw from the sovereign nation it invaded. In fairness, I mentioned Caitlin more for her (few) articles dealing with existential crises while not closing ourselves off to the world’s beauty. My views on Russia are different, shaped by my knowledge of the Maidan, the 2015 civil war in the Donbas and US foreign policy (Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, etc), and not mainstream media. Great review, MaryAnn : I specifically like you pointing out the use of IMAX to go small instead of go big.
Early in the film Oppenheimer (I think when he’s trying to convince Josh Hartnett – what a cast indeed! – to join him) says something like “we know the Nazis are going to build it so we have to do it first, it’s the only choice,” a sentiment you have highlighted. I was just *vibrating* in my seat, wanting to yell at them “No! You don’t have to! It would be enough to keep them from doing it!!” and I think the film, while really doing an incredibly moving job of grappling with Oppenheimer’s conflicted feelings about the bomb’s use, never quite grapples with that conclusion being a foregone one.
That said, I thought this film was more or less magnificent, and appreciate your writing on it. oh Heavens I haven’t the slightest clue. If they knew it was happening, and they knew where (which I think they did..?), I struggle to think they could not have spent at least some effort on trying to disrupt the progress, rather than make it a race. This is idealistic and pacifistic of me and I know, but heavens do I wish de-escalation was a more valued trait throughout American history and culture.

There’s a whole discussion about how he’s not a member of the party, etc. I can’t recall now why I included Tatlock in that description — isn’t there also some talk about how she wasn’t as committed as she might be? The quibble is that Jean Tatlock wasn’t a “pseudo-Communist.”  Unlike Oppenheimer, she was a an active, committed member of the Party.  Unlike Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty or his brother Frank, she never left it. The more substantial comment is that Strauss shouldn’t be dismissed as merely a “shallow, grasping functionary.”  He was a talented man who had worked for Herbert Hoover in the emergency food relief program after World War I, turned that into a job as an investment banker, and made a fortune on Wall Street before and during the Depression.  He was a reserve Navy officer who oversaw all war production for the Navy Department in World War II and wound up an admiral.  Though a Republican, Harry Truman put him on the Atomic Energy Commission.  Ambitious and insecure, Strauss was smart enough to recognize men who were smarter, and he longed to be recognized as one of them.  Like Salieri, his dramatic equivalent, or like Nixon, he was a B+ striver who desperately wanted to be an A and envied and resented men of genius who achieved effortlessly what he could never attain through sweat and cunning."
"Aug 23, 2023",positive,"Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job with his portrayal of Dr. Oppenheimer! Not only did he resemble Dr. Oppenheimer, he was able to capture all of the fear and torment with his facial expression alone! Christopher Nolan truly brought filmmaking up a notch!"
"Aug 22, 2023",positive," “Oppenheimer” is so stuffed -- with historic information, blue-chip actors and cinematic techniques -- you wonder if it even belongs in the same breath as other films released this year. In the biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” he details the distractions the physicist had from multiple sources as he worked to unlock the weapon’s secrets. Oppenheimer (played with great poise by Cillian Murphy) didn’t just have political opponents, he had nagging insiders who could have spilled the secrets to any number of enemies. Keeping a lid on the build, dubbed the “Manhattan Project,” was often the least of his worries. On the homefront, he had a feisty, forthright wife (Emily Blunt) and a needy mistress (Florence Pugh) who had the ability to steal his focus. In the hastily built Los Alamos (where scientists were united to craft the bomb), he had a deadline-crazy general (Matt Damon) and a phalanx of experts who demanded his attention. Murphy handles it skillfully (Damon isn’t quite as controlled) and gets his project underway. Then, it’s a matter of ensuring it won’t destroy those creating it. Throughout the mission, Nolan switches to scenes with Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, chair of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Nominated for a cabinet post, Strauss tries to sully Oppenheimer’s reputation in order to build his own. Shot in black-and-white, the hearing and confirmation scenes represent the dismantling of Oppenheimer. The color shots show what happened outside the process. Folded into all of it, of course, is the thought that the man could be a Communist, working for interests other than the United States. The witch hunt ties nicely with the statements Nolan makes about politics and its role in the arms race. Oppenheimer talks with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) at one point and learns what he has to lose. It’s a telling scene that confirms games have always been played in Washington. When Oppenheimer and company test their bomb, Nolan builds tension by using sound and light to underscore the moment. Step by step, you witness areas where the film could be the leading contender for Academy Awards. There are so many supporting actors of note (it’s like an indie director’s dream team), you’ll wonder who will emerge from the pack. Downey is obviously a standout -- at times it’s impossible to recognize him under the makeup and gestures -- but there are also smart turns from Alden Ehrenreich, Dylan Arnold and Damon. Subtly, we see Oppenheimer age. The makeup effects are first-rate, aiding Murphy in his process. While he isn’t a flashy actor, Murphy displays plenty of emotion on his gaunt face. It’s not difficult to see the wheels turning. When he’s greeted by his team following its victory, life becomes a blur. Like the bomb, there’s plenty of flash, indistinguishable sound and a sense of dread. Like “The Candidate,” the moment has an “oh, no, what have I done?” feel. If you removed all the daredevil stunts Tom Cruise does in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One,” you’d have a nifty little 90-minute film."
"Aug 18, 2023",negative,"I find the last third of this movie to be interesting, and the first two-thirds to be long and, at times, not understandable."
"Aug 16, 2023",positive," Much like Barbie, there's probably not a ton to be said about Oppenheimer at this point, except to say that it's every bit as good as people are saying. Still, I'm going to take a run at it. What stands out most about Oppenheimer is how much it's both very much a Christopher Nolan film and quite a radical departure for him. Yes, loads of the old Nolan tropes are present and accounted for: multiple timelines, an epic scope, trouble writing female characters, practical effects shot on IMAX cameras, a booming and intentionally over-stuffed soundtrack, and of course, Cillian Murphy, finally taking centre stage.  On the other hand, it's a fairly straightforward film that's very much a mix of pure biopic and, essentially, courtroom drama that consists mostly of people talking in rooms. And by ""people"" I do mostly mean men - this was the 1940s, after all. It's a huge film, designed to be watched in IMAX (as I did) but it's actually a very intimate tale: arguably the first character study that Nolan has ever done. And yes, it's also the first of his films to feature nudity and/ or sex, but it's a sex scene as only Christopher Nolan would do it, as mid-coitus, Florence Pugh's character dismounts to pick up a book written in Sanskrit and incorporates it into the action - with the immortal words, ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"" acting as basically the, um, climax of the scene. Either way, some may miss the Nolan-ness of Nolan's latest film, but after the undeniably creative but ultimately crushingly disappointing Tenet, going back to basics was a move that very much paid off. Not that he needed to go too far as the film that preceded Tenet was the historical war film, Dunkirk. Even then, though, Dunkirk still shared a certain coldness to it, a lack of interest in its characters, that prevented me from ever coming close to loving it. Unsurprisingly, Oppenheimer has a ludicrously impressive cast, with yet another familiar face popping up every few minutes, but crucially, even the smallest parts - and there are loads of small parts - have enough character to them that you understand why so many stars and excellent character actors showed up even just for a couple of minutes of screen time. And after playing pretty much no one but Tony Stark for a decade, it's a real pleasure to see Robert Downey Jr get the chance to really cut loose here and remind us how great and versatile an actor he really is. Even the film's two ""main"" female characters make a serious impact with their limited screen time and undeniably thinly drawn characters. All joking aside, though I do understand why people view Florence Pugh spending much of her screentime in the buff as purely gratuitous, it seems pretty apparent to me that this was done to draw a contrast between Oppenheimer's two loves. And, yes, this is a cheat, but it does genuinely put Pugh's character's emotional rawness in stark contrast to Emily Blunt's character's literally buttoned-up stoicism.  No matter how great the supporting cast are, though, this film belongs entirely to the eponymous Robert Oppenheimer and to Cillian Murphy's spectacular, sure-to-be-award-winning performance of this enormously complex historical giant. Aside for Peaky Blinders, he has spent much of the past decade in small supporting roles, so there's something particularly gratifying about his performance here, which is, in part, pure leading-man charisma and in part, nuanced and deep character-acting. This is a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb, certainly, but more than anything it's about what being the driving force behind the weapons that would kill thousands in Nagasaki and Hiroshima and set the groundwork for a potential nuclear holocaust, would do to the psyche of its creator. Especially because there is such a convincing argument that it was a necessary evil to prevent Germany from build its own atomic bomb and to finally and definitively defeat a Japan unwilling to surrender the war - or at least so it seemed at the time. "
"Aug 15, 2023",positive," Biographical drama starring Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt. During the Second World War, American physicist J Robert Oppenheimer and fellow scientists race against time to develop an atomic bomb before the Nazis. But, during the 1950s Red Scare, his name is dragged through the mud by US officials."
"Aug 11, 2023",positive," Finished the 2023 edition of Fantasia Festival with fifteen titles of varying success (only two really didn’t work for me). RIVER was my favorite. APORIA and WITH LOVE AND A MAJOR ORGAN follow closely behind. All in all another great dive into genre films with a festival that never disappoints. I also finally caught up to OPPENHEIMER: a great feat, albeit probably not a Top Ten feature for me. Figured it’d be the first of the BARBENHEIMER behemoth to be pulled from screens due to its runtime. So, here’s hoping I can catch BARBIE in the next couple weeks too. Time will be tight, though, as TIFF is coming right around the corner. Already received my first screener despite the full schedule not being released until 8/15. When tragedy strikes the Osawa family on a day marked for celebration, neither Taeko (Fumino Kimura) nor Jirô (Kento Nagayama) quite knows what to do. They should be able to grieve together. They should be able to look into each other’s eyes. And yet they simply stare off into the distance, going through motions as numb, hollow husks searching for some sign of life while trying to avoid showing too much. Because it’s difficult to know exactly where they stand. Despite being married for a year now, they still find themselves at a distance due to the circumstances surrounding their relationship. Taeko was married once before and had a six-year-old son (Tetta Shimada’s Keita) before Park (Atom Sunada) ran away. Jirô was engaged (to Hirona Yamazaki’s Yamazaki) when he began his affair with her. Add the fact that his parents (Misuzu Kanno’s Myoe and, especially, Tomorô Taguchi’s Makoto) can’t quite wrap their heads around their son marrying a divorcee and forcing them to be grandparents to a grandchild that “isn’t theirs” and you can begin to see how fragile things already were. In another filmmaker’s hands, LOVE LIFE would probably be full of fireworks as this married couple comes to grips with what happened by distancing themselves even further while moving closer to those former loves from their pasts. This would probably be the case if it was set in many places besides Japan too. But that’s what makes Kôji Fukada’s drama so powerful. The silences where steely frustrations and unavoidable embarrassment are left unsaid really speak to the struggle these characters face moving forward. Because everything intimated and refuted about their love does exist. And how they react to those truths could shatter everything they’ve built. So, don’t expect things to get blown out of proportion. Don’t assume Park or Yamazaki are going to use the situation to get back together with Taeko and Jirô respectively. Jealousy isn’t what Fukada is interested in pursuing. He’s focusing upon forgiveness instead. Not for the other’s transgressions or unspoken feelings, but for themselves. Can Taeko forgive herself for stopping to look for Park? Can Jirô forgive himself for breaking Yamazaki’s heart? Can their shared nightmarish plight get Makoto and Myoe to finally realize the pettiness of their cold shoulder to support the family given to them rather than lament the loss of the one they always wanted? And there’s the need to forgive themselves for the spark to this emotional upheaval. Taeko blames herself. Jirô feels guilty for selfishly breathing a sigh of relief when he should have been mourning. The circumstances are obviously heightened, but the result is a resonant and universal sense of what living with and loving someone else entails. It’s never easy. It’s always complicated. And you will ultimately make mistakes. But the thing you cannot do is run from the inevitable fallout or avoid the truths that exist in your heart. Because it’s not about what you did to let shame prevent you from looking your partner in the eyes. It’s about looking there anyway. Kimura shines in the lead role. Her strength to call out Jirô’s father when he goes too far or push Park for answers when he suddenly comes back into her life mixes with a justified anger for having to deal with both at all that provides a palpable baseline for who she is and the decisions she’ll soon make. Because Taeko will do anything for the people she loves. She doesn’t absorb these slights for herself, but to protect those who are inevitably caught in the crossfire through no fault of their own (Keita as a symbol of her former marriage, Park as a deaf Korean immigrant, etc.). It’s a commendable feature of her love and an unfortunate opening that leaves her vulnerable. The film is a series of events wherein Taeko and Jirô are let down by each other and themselves. It’s about the ways in which they contort themselves so as not to actually talk about what has happened or what they’re truly feeling—leaving them susceptible to being hurt further by the need to fill in the blanks, conjuring their own assumptions instead. They turn away rather than towards to confront their fears elsewhere, leaving their genuine love in a purgatory that may never relinquish it. The question is therefore whether they can remember they’re no longer alone. It’s a tale of two trials. Except, of course, that neither half is a trial—a fact those presiding over both events are quick to stipulate whenever the accused (or party at threat of being “denied”) dares to call their tactics out for being unjust. One sees J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) appealing the revocation of his security clearance years after stewarding the invention of the atomic bomb. The other finds Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) seeking a cabinet appointment. Both prove that even the most cautiously optimistic belief that any nation on Earth might handle the responsibility of nuclear power was simply naïveté. That’s what Christopher Nolan’s OPPENHEIMER (adapted from the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin) is really about. Not how the titular character changed the world in Los Alamos. Not his life as a womanizing prophet of theoretical quantum physics. No, it’s about the reality that the bomb was a symptom (albeit much more than that to those impacted at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) of the prevailing international military industrial complex rather than its catalyst. What should have been a deterrent to war merely became the next tool to ensure we’d never see a period of time without a war raging again. It’s a sobering thought that ultimately haunts Oppenheimer from the moment we first meet him out of time. There he is as a student at Princeton, unable to sleep with the sound and fury of death and destruction roiling through his brain. There he is at a table in a tiny room being grilled by an over-zealous prosecutor (Jason Clarke’s Roger Robb) at the behest of an “impartial” tribunal, unable to fully hear his words above the sensorial overload of terror for what his science wrought. But none of that is present to earn sympathy from us or to prove an admission of guilt. It’s a deflection from what’s really going on. A reminder that intent is meaningless in the face of ambition. Because the truth of what Nolan weaves through flashbacks sparked by the testimonies of both Oppenheimer and Strauss is that it’s all been a game. Those who believe themselves to be in control are merely puppets for the ones who are. The difference is that Oppenheimer acknowledges this fact. He knows Admiral Groves (Matt Damon) picked him because he was a liability. Because he had everything to lose and thus one hand perpetually tied behind his back. He may have been arrogant, but he wasn’t vain. Not like Strauss—a man so wrapped up in the strings he’s pulling that he forgets about the ones tightly affixed to his own wrists. At three hours long, however, we aren’t able to fully grasp this notion until we’re already two-thirds of the way through thanks to “surprise” revelations that prove cuter than they do profound. Does shielding the real reason Nolan has chosen these mirrored “trials” add anything to the whole? No. The impact of what we watch beforehand doesn’t grow out of the reveal. Only the impact of what follows does. So, why not play it straight from the beginning? Why toy with the audience’s expectations? Because that which does follow pales in comparison to the rest. It serves to create a villain. And, in so doing, removes us from the weight of Oppenheimer’s grief to enjoy a romp of karmic “justice” instead. Don’t get me wrong, though. Downey Jr. is absolutely fantastic and I love his more direct plot line to an eventual comeuppance. I’m just not sure it doesn’t take away from the potency of the more introspective and esoteric Prometheus tale at the film’s center. That’s why I must step back and view the whole as being about more than these men. To see Nolan’s goal as proving they were both pawns to a changing tide of bloodlust and tribalism wherein World War II became less about finding allies to fight for a common cause and more about aligning with enemies to cheat, steal, and cut loose once the bigger threat to both was defeated. That’s where the communist angle comes in and why all those tertiary characters (including Florence Pugh drastically underused Jean Tatlock) must be introduced despite being throwaways who cannot earn the emotional gut-punch Nolan wishes they can. Jean, the Chevaliers, even Oppenheimer’s brother are pawns to his story like he’s a pawn to that of the United States’ demand for supremacy. It all becomes fodder for Roger Rob to wield as Ludwig Göransson’s score ramps up to climax. So much so that even the wonderful scene where he gets taken to task by Emily Blunt’s Kitty (an actor elevating another weakly written prop to almost feel real) becomes a victim to Nolan’s too-smart-for-his-own-good shell game. Thankfully, despite my qualms with Nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief he’s finally told a straightforward story, I was still completely taken by its gravitas. Give Murphy and Downey Jr. Oscars. Check my blood pressure after the latest PTSD-fueled flashback hits Oppenheimer while he attempts to be what is wanted of him even as he wishes to retreat. Bask in the narrative parallels by looking back to see where the manipulations were coming from even if the need to do so feels unnecessarily convoluted. Much like my reaction to Paul Thomas' Anderson’s THERE WILL BE BLOOD, OPPENHEIMER is objectively a monumental work by an artist at the peak of his ability. I just prefer Nolan’s messier swings wherein heart and excitement trump his obvious technical prowess. Ryland Brickson Cole Tews and Mike Cheslik’s LAKE MICHIGAN MONSTER earned its cult following with a DIY aesthetic and madcap absurdity that I respected more than I enjoyed. It was fun. A title I’d recommend being seen by those who already have an inclination rather than one I’d enthusiastically demand be viewed sight unseen. So, I won’t lie and say I didn’t approach their follow-up HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS with slight trepidation. Or that my discovering it was a whooping 108-minutes long didn’t make me cringe at the thought of going comatose once the joke went stale. But while this live-action LOONEY TUNES epic of silent-era slapstick nonsense is definitely too long (I admittedly took a critical break around the hour mark), it proves itself to be a vast improvement over its predecessor by fully leaning into the madness until you can’t help reveling in its charm. The story follows a hapless apple whiskey purveyor named Jean Kayak (Tews) who gets too sloshed on his own wares to realize an influx of beavers have been munching on every piece of wood in the forest. Fast-forward to the third verse of the opening song and Jean finds himself destitute and dry in the freezing cold, his apple trees and distillery burnt to a crisp. A few circuitous gags later, whereby he attempts to keep warm and find food, puts Jean onto the trail of a master trapper (Wes Tank), a cantankerous shopkeeper (Doug Mancheski), his furrier daughter (Olivia Graves), and a native trader (Luis Rico). Gleaning what he can from their comings and goings, he eventually becomes a trapper himself with dreams of killing enough rabbits, beavers, and wolves to buy a good coat, get his own rifle, and marry the only woman in this war zone of conniving creatures regardless of her father loathing his very existence. Cheslik (who directs) and Tews (who co-writes with him) pretty much put forth a series of skits wherein Jean is brutalized by his would-be animal victims in ways that teach him how to later brutalize them instead. He uses that unintentional education to lay the foundation for a Rube Goldberg-esque master plan of food pyramid violence that he knows can win him his prize. And all the while the beavers continue building a bunker that houses dastardly plans of their own. It’s a humorous ride in lo-fi yet impeccably crafted compositing between live action and animation for quick-witted Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote action—with a few Bugs Bunny versus Elmer Fudd shenanigans thrown in. Mostly silent besides grunting, the scenes between humans (namely Jean, the Furrier, and her father) homage Chaplin/Keaton antics while the decision to have all the animals played by people in mascot costumes lends a surreally inspired dynamic of nightmarishly comic proportions. That it all leads to a finale you cannot even begin to imagine is both its best and worst feature. Because despite it making the ride worth any pacing bumps, it also reveals just how berserk things could have gone much, much sooner. Yes, the ways in which Jean and the animals attack each other escalate in their idiocy as time passes. But it’s still just them trying/failing to kill each other again and again. Those first two-thirds desperately need more variety and WTF details like a Beaver Sherlock and Watson. Setting up what’s coming with intent (and a much defter hand than you might assume while watching) only matters if your audience remains awake for the payoff. If not for my makeshift intermission, I might not have been. But I’m glad I was since its conclusion really is unforgettable. Elsa (Sonya Walger) has ALS. Diagnosed six months ago, her symptoms have reached the point of affecting her job—a job that’s intentionally shrouded in secrecy at the start of John Rosman’s NEW LIFE. We glean details (sparse apartment, handgun, and Tony Amendola’s mysterious handler Raymond visiting with a new assignment), though, and conclude she’s either a CIA operative or assassin despite it not really mattering. It should matter. The fact it doesn’t is the main reason I could never let the story wash over me and the core of why it fails to live up to its potential. Because although the movie is very much Elsa’s story, she isn’t the “lead.” She’s neither the first person we meet nor the presumed protagonist. We are conversely conditioned to hope she fails. So, suddenly pushing her into the “hero” role halfway through ultimately destroyed what was left of my good will. Not because she shouldn’t be the hero or that her trajectory doesn’t illustrate the overall message Rosman is trying to convey, but because he undercuts the effectiveness and necessity of both to facilitate an empty twist. We meet Jessica (Hayley Erin) first instead. Distraught, covered in blood, and running for her life towards home. She washes up, finds a change of clothes, and discovers the engagement ring her boyfriend never gave her before realizing two men with guns have entered the house. Escaping through a window she finds herself stowing away in the backs of strangers’ cars, eventually meeting a kindly older couple willing to help. The assumption we make (as well as anyone who encounters her and her black eye) is that Jessica is on the run from violence. That she cannot divulge too many details because trusting the wrong person could be the difference between life and death. Add Elsa’s activation on her crosscut parallel pursuit and we presume it’s true. Jessica either did something or saw something that a deep-pocketed entity can’t let become public knowledge. So, she becomes our focus. She becomes the character we pull for regardless of Elsa’s own tragic backstory. Flipping the script doesn’t therefore excite us. It frustrates. I don’t want to give too much away, so I’ll try to keep plot specifics to a minimum beyond admitting Jessica is a MacGuffin. It doesn’t matter that we spend two-thirds of the runtime following her isolated path or that the film asks us to sympathize with her plight. Her true purpose is to set Elsa’s wheels in motion. How can you not then wonder what might have been if Rosman simply let that be the case? What if he wrote this script as Elsa’s story wherein Jessica is merely her current case instead of pretending as though her existence is on the same level of importance first? I don’t think it fundamentally changes a thing when looking back with hindsight. Maybe the first half isn’t as mysterious as it is now, but the second half wouldn’t be nearly as manipulative either. Because we would know where we stand with the characters. We would give Elsa our weight and Jessica our pity. The latter can still have pathos. Her progress can still be about not taking life for granted. It would simply transparently do so for the benefit of the former. Because we also don’t know what movie we’re in due to the subterfuge. Not truly. NEW LIFE’s start and finish are on completely different wavelengths. Yes, it’s cool and superficially effective, but it proves to be for naught the second that shift undermines the overall package. It’s too bad too since the much more horror-infused second half is memorable in its thrills and special effects. It’s also a shame because Walger delivers a fantastic performance that deserves more time and intent to let its third act revelations breathe and earn its emotional gravitas—gravitas the filmmaking thinks it has already. I get the desire to make things more complex and twisty, but the script needs to be airtight for such devices to truly excel. It can’t make you feel as though it led you on only to provide a “gotcha” that renders more of what we’ve seen inconsequential than it augments. There’s an intriguing concept here as far as using the idea that ALS is like being a prisoner in one’s own body. That’s a thought that justifiably conjures fear, especially for those who don’t need to accept the reality themselves. I just think the finished product uses it as a gimmick rather than a lesson. As the current climate evolves into increased violence, the future setting of Robert Hloz’s RESTORE POINT delivers a solution. It’s a technology that provides a way to revive those whose time to die was forced upon them by another. As long as you remember to download a back-up of your consciousness and memories, the taxpayer-funded institute led by Dr. Rohan (Karel Dobrý) can bring you back. His machine restores your body of its wounds before uploading your save file, allowing you to continue your life with nothing but a few hours of blank space. The crucial catch to screenwriters Tomislav Cecka and Zdenek Jecelin’s plot is that Rohan cannot legally use any back-ups more than forty-eight-hours old. That’s the cutoff point for “rejection.” Think of the raw data of your mind as an organ being transplanted into your body. It will always be younger than its host and thus an anomalous intrusion to be fought against. So, you must be diligent. You must always remember to upload just in case. And don’t forget: one person’s grace period to allow themselves the oft bout of forgetfulness (or laziness) is another’s loophole. Those forty-eight hours separate salvation from absolute death. We learn about this duality from a lone wolf detective who knows it all too well. Em Trochinowska’s (Andrea Mohylová) husband was killed by a terrorist organization seeking to free humanity from the prison of state-sanctioned immortality. Known as the River of Life, the group murders innocents to prove a counter-intuitive point whereby it instills the fear that no one is safe while also bolstering the importance of Kohan’s work—enough for him to take the company private as a means of “advancing their mission” (increasing profits). Unlike past attacks, however, they’ve finally caught their mistake. Rather than let their work be erased, they now only pull the trigger after their victim’s copy expires. A web of intrigue stemming from Rohan’s chief scientist David Kurlstat (Matěj Hádek) and his wife being the latest “martyrs” ensues as Em once again hopes to use the hunt for a killer to single-handedly stop River of Life completely. It’s precisely this drive to shirk the rules for a personal agenda that endears her to untrustworthy figures and not those protected by said rules. Enter an illegal copy of Kurlstat (missing the six months of memories leading to his death), a suspected terrorist (Milan Ondrík’s Viktor), and a cavalier Europol agent (Václav Neužil’s Mansfield), each leading to more and more secrets that blur the line between good and evil where it comes to wealth and God-complexes. There’s ample lore to work through as far as understanding the overall world on-screen, but it’s so close to our own capitalist wasteland that catching the drift shouldn’t be difficult. The dynamic built between this technology and how it fits into a social hierarchy fueled by profit is similarly easy to comprehend. That means we can devote our energy to getting to the bottom of the more specific mystery. Who benefits most from a group like River of Life? Why is Viktor willing to turn himself in as long as he’s guaranteed a “fair trial”? The answers to these questions are hardly unique, but the journey towards proving them never ceases to entertain. A lot of that has do to with a solid lead turn from Mohylová—ever cautious and skeptical enough to tread lightly with the often-overwrought characters surrounding her. But there’s also the fantastic production design that truly excels beyond obvious budgetary limitations as ingenious art direction expertly turns contemporary items futuristic in lieu of fabricating everything fresh. This is apparently Czechia’s first sci-fi feature in forty years and thus a testament to everyone involved that it proves a worthy return to the genre. It may feel by-the-numbers in scope, but its execution more than makes up the difference. The last departure of the day has driven away, leaving the employees of Kibune, Kyoto’s Japanese Inn ""Fujiya"" with a break before that evening’s new arrivals. Two guests (Gôta Ishida’s Kusumi and Masashi Suwa’s Nomiya) start enjoying a meal. Another hits the hot baths (Haruki Nakagawa’s agent Sugiyama) while his novelist Obata (Yoshimasa Kondô) anxiously attempts to shake writer’s block. Taku (Yûki Torigoe), the establishment’s youngest chef, naps while his seniors (Kohei Morooka’s Morioka and Yoshifumi Sakai’s Eiji) prepare dinner. And Mikoto (Riko Fujitani), Kohachi (Munenori Nagano), and Chino (Saori) continue their shifts. Unfortunately, they all also suddenly find themselves back where they were two minutes prior without warning or explanation. Just chaos. Because chaos is what occurs when a sprawling group of people find themselves stuck in an unexplainable temporal phenomenon. Mikoto and her coworkers catch on quickly because they’re forced to redo menial tasks that render the rewind indisputable. Kusumi and Nomiya need a bit more handholding since the only change they’re seeing right away is the fact the rice they just ate returned to their bowls. Director Junta Yamaguchi and screenwriter Makoto Ueda (who were also behind the equally ingenious time-travel film BEYOND THE INFINITE TWO MINUTES with most of the same cast as part of the Europe Kikaku collective), meticulously go room to room by way of Mikoto’s vantage point as lead to lay the groundwork for their latest RIVER. She becomes the focal point as every two-minute segment’s fade to black reopens with her standing by the water before turning around to help put out whatever fire has inevitably erupted since. First she and Kohachi realize what’s happening. Then they fill in Chino and their boss Shiraki (Masahiro Kuroki). From there it’s Kusumi and Nomiya. Then Obata (who is simultaneously overjoyed at the prospect of ignoring his deadline and curious about the experiences this consequence-free purgatory affords his imagination); Sugiyama (half-naked and desperate to escape the sauna), and Taku (finally waking to the fact the same song has been repeating itself over and over). Add characters who must figure things out themselves (Eiji is a science major who takes it upon himself to discover the time loop’s source and return to normalcy; Kazunari Tosa’s hunter; and Shiori Kubo’s outsider stranded as a result of her vehicle having a frozen engine) and events can’t help spiraling out of control. All the extra time causes everyone to say things they might not normally say—clearing the air and confusing it at the same time. Suddenly they begin to wonder if they are the cause. Idle wishes and prayers to the Gods for love, inspiration, and salvation sharing a common solution: more time. While the journey doesn’t utilize a single-take device like BEYOND, its frenetic pace and potential for extreme emotions (the kind that conjure laughter as much as fear once things reach the point of suicidal thoughts—a time loop staple) demands a similar level of investment that you’ll be more than willing to provide due to its infectious sense of entertainment. The filmmakers know exactly when to pivot from exposition to dramatics to climactic puzzle-solving, never letting us get tired by one aspect or the other. We want to learn about what’s happening alongside these characters while watching how they unravel in response to the ordeal. We want to embrace Mikoto’s unbridled excitement during a wild yet heartfelt second act that gives her control of the narrative to deliver a necessary dream while igniting a nightmare. And we do want there to be a way out regardless of whether it comes as a byproduct of that which we already know or a completely new development in the eleventh hour. When you have a stable of eccentric characters willing to feed into the genre’s stereotypical clichés so Mikoto can travel her own path without them distracting from her own personal progression, it’s easy to get lost in the moment so her highs and lows hit with maximum potency. And yet we still care about the others since the changing world (snow appears and disappears depending on which “world line” the latest reset landed upon) brings their desires into clearer focus too. “Lucas captures it all as data while Mills unleashes the artistry of those numbers courtesy of sight and sound. Beauty lives in death. Suffering is born from life. Everything is connected.” – Full thoughts at The Film Stage. “You'd be having the time of your life even if the filmmakers decided to phone the plot in. That they didn't results in a dense work that stimulates the senses more than even INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE could.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “This isn't a documentary on album design. Corbijn's assignment was Powell and Thorgerson's partnership. So, rather than gain insight into the industry, the film's worth is in its captivating stories about the phenomenon that was these two men.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “An expansive look at how damaging technological growth on an unprecedented scale proves when put in the hands of cutthroat opportunists left to police themselves so a largely apathetic government can willingly reap the benefits of letting them.” – Full thoughts at HHYS."

J Robert Oppenheimer (interpretado por el actor irlandés Cillian Murphy) es considerado el padre de las armas nucleares, y su legado histórico resulta bastante complejo, como lo expresa el libro American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer de Kai Bird y Martin J Sherwin, en el cual se basa esta película.  El filme se centra en las dos audiencias del gobierno que se desarrollaron en los años 50, y va atrás en tiempo para narrar su trágica historia desde que fue estudiante, seducido por ideas de izquierda, y luego profesor en California, hasta que entra al Proyecto Manhattan en Los Álamos, Nuevo México, confrontando la ciencia con la política y la teoría con la práctica. Como líder de dicho proyecto se le encargó desarrollar la bomba atómica durante el periodo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, y si bien su creación cambió el rumbo de la historia, el uso que se le dio posteriormente se salió de su control, hasta que terminó oponiéndose a la militarización de su propio invento. Esto por supuesto lo condujo a un proceso autodestructivo de su imagen de héroe. En el campo de lo personal tampoco escapó conflictos, viéndose involucrado con dos mujeres, su esposa Kitty (Emily Blunt) y una amante militante comunista, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) de temperamento volátil y pasional, que sirvió de excusa para la cacería de brujas a la que fue sometido.  La manera como el director aproxima los miedos que aquejan al personaje y su lucha interna a través de ingeniosas imágenes surrealistas, que pueden ser ráfagas de fuego intenso o finos hilos de luz, es lo más admirable de la cinta, y nos quedamos con ganas de ver más al respecto. Lo mismo sucede con las imágenes voyeristas que hacen memoria de su intimidad, mezclando lo personal con lo político. Por eso el aspecto moral se interpone cuando por un lado su ascendencia judía le hace sentir el compromiso a desarrollar el arma que dará fin a la guerra, temiendo que los alemanes la descubran primero, pero por otro, comprende el peligro del avance ilimitado de la tecnología bélica y el daño que representa para la humanidad.  A pesar de que la primera parte de la película puede resultar algo tediosa Oppenheimer es el proyecto más ambicioso de Nolan, que cuenta con excelentes actuaciones, como Robert Downey Jr, Mat Damon y Benny Safdie, y una impactante fotografía a cargo de Hoyte Van Hoytema que contribuye con la valiente exploración de tan delicados temas."
"Aug 9, 2023",positive,OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. An engrossing epic that brings you inside the tortured mind of a man driven to change the world. Cillian Murphy is quietly stunning as the consumed Oppenheimer and RDJ delivers an Oscar worthy performance.
"Aug 9, 2023",positive,"This is very clear, effective, disciplined prestige filmmaking, enough to make this one of the toniest pieces of Oscarbait that I expect to see this year - but it is Oscarbait."
"Aug 9, 2023",positive," I don’t consider myself a Christopher Nolan acolyte, even though I count two of his films among my favorites. More often than not, I feel that his overreliance on exposition undermines his ambition. I did not feel that way watching his latest epic, Oppenheimer, a riveting cinematic experience that explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb.” Because of Oppenheimer’s biopic nature, Nolan turns his expository tendencies into an attribute as he meticulously expounds on a man who built his life around a branch of physics few of us understand: quantum mechanics. Nolan approaches Oppenheimer from two completely different perspectives. The first, unsurprisingly, is from the point of view of the titular character, played by Cillian Murphy. It begins just before Oppenheimer’s 1926 departure from Cambridge to study theoretical physics in Germany, and ends in 1963 when he was presented with a Presidential Award. After efficiently establishing the key figures in Oppenheimer’s life, not to mention his intimidating intellect (he taught himself Dutch in just six week so he could use it to deliver an entire lecture on quantum theory), two distinct chapters of his life become the dominant focus; engineering the development of the first atomic bomb, and the subsequent undoing of his reputation and political influence by postwar McCarthyism. The second perspective comes from someone who doesn’t exactly leap off of the pages of history, but who’s extremely important nonetheless. His name was Lewis Strauss, the chairperson of the Atomic Energy Commission, for which he tried to recruit Oppenheimer after the war had ended. Strauss, played in old age makeup and gray hair by Robert Downey Jr., recalls his uneasy relationship with Oppenheimer to an aide while attending a Senate confirmation hearing. In just one of his many stylistic touches, Nolan contrasts the differing perspectives of Oppenheimer and Strauss by using color film for Oppenheimer’s POV and black & white for Strauss’s, which not only helps in keeping track of whose head we’re in, but also beautifully symbolizes how differently they each think. Oppenheimer’s dialog-driven historical drama is atypical for Christopher Nolan, but his fondness for juggling multiple timelines hasn’t waned. Nor has his kinetic filmmaking style of rapidly cutting between disparate scenes accompanied by an aggressively persistent background score designed to create a sense of urgency, with abrupt silence, rather than musical crescendos, punctuating the dramatic moments. I usually find Nolan’s hyperbolic manipulation of sound and image exhausting. Here, though, it works, helping Oppenheimer’s three-hour runtime feel much shorter. Several actors manage to distinguish themselves from the massive cast of top-notch talent, including Matt Damon as the Lieutenant General in charge of the Manhattan Project; Benny Safdie as Oppenheimer’s thorny colleague and intellectual foil; Emily Blunt as his fiery, alcoholic wife; and Gary Oldman as a self-satisfied Harry Truman. But no character, in this or any of Nolan’s previous work, is as complexly drawn as Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, who’s presented as intelligent yet naïve, scientific yet philosophical, honest yet secretive, prone to getting lost in thought contemplating whirling electrons and nuclear fusion, and, in the end, a tortured soul. Nolan refrains from passing judgment on Oppenheimer – leaving that to us, if we so choose – suggesting instead that it’s within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy. Considering how now, more than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we’re all living under the shadow of Oppenheimer’s creation, Oppenheimer is THE movie of our time. Ever since he was a teen, Paul has been involved in some form of film criticism, exhibition, or production. For the better part of two decades, he moderated the film discussion group, Let’s Talk About the Movies, which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic Del Mar theater in downtown Santa Cruz.

"Aug 8, 2023",positive," Christopher Nolan delivers what is certain to be a serious awards contender with this stunning biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted and impressively written, it’s one of the best films of the year. The film unfolds in two parallel timelines, with Nolan cross-cutting between them. The first, entitled Fission, is shot in colour and begins with Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as a student, taking him through his stewardship of the Manhattan Project, the creation of the atom bomb and its eventual deployment by the US government in 1945. The second, Fusion, is shot in black and white, and details both a security clearance hearing that is essentially a kangaroo court aimed at discrediting Oppenheimer, and a separate hearing involving Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Louis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and his potential appointment to the Senate, the significance of which becomes clear as the film unfolds. Throughout the film, important figures in Oppenheimer’s life emerge, including: his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt); his Communist mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), Lt Gen Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who appoints Oppenheimer as the leader of the Manhattan Project; best friend Isidor Rabi (David Krumholz); fellow scientist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett); Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and dog-with-a-bone prosecuting attorney Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), who dominates the security clearance hearing. Murphy (who’s been a reliable supporting presence in previous Nolan movies) is simply terrific in the lead, simultaneously portraying Oppenheimer as arrogant, vulnerable, naïve and visionary. To that end, his ice blue eyes are put to extraordinary use, a faraway gaze that takes in both the future and the past, as well as a universe composed of atoms and electron waves. Murphy essentially makes you feel Oppenheimer’s every thought and it’s intoxicating. The supporting cast are equally astonishing, particularly Downey Jr, who is on career best form as Strauss – his Best Supporting Actor nomination is surely already in the bag. It’s a truly magnificent turn, initially starstruck and then increasingly full of resentment and bitterness as he finds himself opposed to Oppenheimer at various turns. Damon runs him a close second, with a delightful turn as the bullish Groves, and there are memorable turns from a multitude of great character actors as the other scientists at Los Alamos. The script, skilfully adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman’s biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, explores a number of compelling themes, from the central Prometheus parallel (giving mankind the seed of its own fiery destruction) to ideas of guilt and redemption, as well as complex political machination. There’s also the subtle, intriguing suggestion that Nolan sees Oppenheimer as an incendiary twentieth century artist, akin to the likes of T.S. Elliot or Picasso, both of whom receive prominent name-drops. Visually, the film is simply stunning, especially if you’re lucky enough to see it in IMAX on 70mm, the way the director intended – the giant shots of Murphy’s face are worth the price of admission alone. The level of technical achievement throughout is astonishing, from Jennifer Lame’s pacey editing to Hoyt van Hoytema’s striking cinematography, to Ludwig Göransson’s powerful score. Similarly, the sound design is extraordinary, particularly in the aftermath of Hiroshima, when Oppenheimer is forced to confront the magnitude of what he has done, in the face of a seemingly rapturous audience, one of the film’s stand-out scenes. The central set-piece is, of course, the Trinity explosion, complete with an extremely tense build-up and a note of blacker-than-black comedy, as all the scientists agree that there is a “near zero” chance that they won’t ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world in the process, but none of them can really say for certain. The actual detonation is another example of the film’s impressive sound design work, but to say any more would be to dilute the impact. Perhaps Nolan’s most impressive achievement is the fact that he manages to make the hour-long third act of the film (the two hearings) just as compelling as all the bomb-related stuff that precedes it. Effectively, it’s prestige courtroom drama, complete with the genre’s requisite shock twists and turns. In short, this is a stunning piece of work on every level, a compelling, beautifully constructed biopic that leaves you with plenty to think about. It’s also one of the best films of the year. Don’t miss it."
"Aug 7, 2023",positive," Dirigido e roteirizado por Christopher Nolan. Com: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, David Krumholtz, Josh Hartnett, Alex Wolff, Josh Zuckerman, Rory Keane, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Dane DeHaan, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, James Urbaniak, Christopher Denham, Dylan Arnold, Rami Malek, James Remar, Olivia Thirlby, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Gary Oldman e Kenneth Branagh. Um dos momentos mais aterrorizantes de Oppenheimer, cinebiografia do “pai da bomba atômica” dirigida por Christopher Nolan, ocorre em uma sala comum na qual um grupo composto por homens brancos discute com frieza absoluta em quais cidades deverão jogar o artefato nuclear criado pelo personagem-título. Cientes de que causarão a morte imediata de no mínimo 20 ou 30 mil pessoas (o número final ficou em torno de 120 mil), eles tratam a questão sem que detalhes como “moral”, “ética” e “humanidade” interfiram no debate – ainda que trivialidades como o fato de um deles ter passado a lua-de-mel em certa cidade acabem por pesar na decisão. Aliás, o único ali que parece hesitar diante do ataque é justamente o responsável por viabilizá-lo, o que talvez explique seus olhos constantemente assombrados. Adaptado pelo próprio Nolan a partir do livro escrito por Kai Bird e Martin Sherwin, o roteiro adota uma cronologia fluida – como já seria de se esperar em um trabalho do cineasta – que se estrutura em torno de dois pontos-chave: o depoimento de Oppenheimer (Murphy) à comissão secreta que decidirá se sua credencial de segurança máxima será mantida e a audiência na qual a nomeação de Lewis Strauss (Downey Jr) para o cargo de Secretário de Comércio do governo Eisenhower é avaliada. A partir destes dois momentos, o filme salta entre épocas e pontos de vista, concentrando boa parte de sua atenção, claro, no desenvolvimento do Projeto Manhattan e na relação entre o físico e o general Groves (Damon), bem como em detalhes de sua turbulenta vida pessoal, incluindo seu caso com a psiquiatra Jean Tatlock (Pugh) e seu casamento com a bióloga Katherine Oppenheimer (Blunt). Não é de se espantar que, considerando a posição importante do protagonista em um período essencial da História, a trajetória de Oppenheimer inclua interações com dezenas de figuras notórias, o que confere a Nolan a oportunidade de escalar um elenco composto por nomes que habitualmente não aceitariam fazer participações tão breves que, por vezes, soam quase como figuração - como Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Jack Quaid, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek e Gary Oldman -, o que por vezes mais distrai do que acrescenta à produção. Por outro lado, Robert Downey Jr. e Matt Damon aproveitam a oportunidade de viver tipos bastante distintos de seus papeis habituais: este último, evocando a rigidez e a disciplina de um militar veterano; o primeiro, abraçando a amargura e as inseguranças de um homem sem qualquer traço da jovialidade que o ator costuma trazer aos seus personagens. Enquanto isso, Florence Pugh projeta com intensidade a instabilidade psicológica de Tatlock sem permitir que isto defina aquela mulher, ao passo que Emily Blunt escapa da armadilha de encarnar o estereótipo de esposa ressentida ao emprestar a Kitty uma frustração interessante com a aparente passividade do marido, o que a leva a adotar uma postura combativa e valente. Nenhuma destas performances funcionaria, porém, se o centro emocional do filme não contasse com o trabalho irrepreensível de Cillian Murphy, que contrapõe a racionalidade aparente de Oppenheimer às suas paixões ideológicas, românticas e sexuais que muitas vezes o levam a cometer atos impulsivos (ou a fazer declarações imprudentes) que o tornam imprevisível e, consequentemente, fascinante. É instigante, por exemplo, vê-lo abandonar os modos calmos e discretos ao se empolgar diante do interesse acadêmico de seus alunos, exibindo também incapacidade de resistir ao seu desejo por Tatlock e mesmo à sua admiração pelos princípios irredutíveis que – percebam a ironia - a mantêm inalcançável. De forma similar, o ator consegue a proeza de conciliar a obsessão científica do sujeito pela criação da bomba e sua resistência humanista em utilizá-la depois de construída sem que isso soe como pura demagogia ou hipocrisia. Empregando a excelente fotografia de Hoyte Van Hoytema para distinguir visualmente a abordagem narrativa entre a subjetividade de Oppenheimer e uma visão mais distante (não necessariamente objetiva) de sua vida, o longa salta respectivamente entre sequências rodadas em cores e em preto-e-branco – e o fato de boa parte destas últimas se concentrarem em Strauss acaba estabelecendo também um subtexto importante sobre sua visão de mundo e aquela mais abrangente do personagem-título. Além disso, a fabulosa trilha composta por Ludwig Göransson é hábil ao trazer harmonias que parecem enxergar as epifanias científicas de Oppenheimer como algo quase poético, transcendental, enxergando beleza no que poderia se restringir a equações e descrições frias sobre a natureza da fissão nuclear. Para completar, a montagem de Jennifer Lame vai além da simples quebra cronológica, empregando inserts quase abstratos que ilustram os insights do protagonista e oferecem uma porta de entrada para o modo como sua mente opera. Diferente da maior parte da filmografia de Nolan, que normalmente deposita seus esforços mais na elaboração de tramas e menos no desenvolvimento detalhado das figuras que as movem, Oppenheimer pode de certa maneira ser considerado um estudo de personagem – e ainda que os eventos da vida do físico sejam relevantes para o roteiro, o cineasta mantém o foco na atmosfera da narrativa (ao menos, como percebida/sentida pelo protagonista). Aqui e ali, claro, há certo exagero (não estou certo de que incluir a imagem de Oppenheimer nu e transando com Tatlock na sala em que está sendo forçado a discutir sua intimidade seja necessário, martelando no espectador algo que este já havia compreendido), mas de modo geral estas intervenções mais expressivas contribuem para que o público se aproxime de uma figura que poderia com facilidade se manter como um enigma indecifrável. Já os aspectos morais da destruição de Hiroshima e Nagasaki não têm nada de ambíguos na visão do filme, que enxerga com reprovação tanto o cinismo do governo (e dos militares) norte-americano – como usar o termo “artefato” no lugar de “bomba” – quanto suas justificativas para o ataque, já que a Alemanha havia se rendido meses antes e o Japão caminhava para o mesmo fim. (Discuti esta visão – defendida por muitos historiadores contemporâneos – neste post em meu blog.) Não que a obra busque absolver Oppenheimer, já que o próprio fazia questão de se condenar, mas os olhares mais severos são aqueles voltados para os políticos e militares diretamente envolvidos na decisão de usar as bombas, o que inclui o Harry S. Truman que Gary Oldman encarna como um canalha orgulhoso e xenofóbico (o que de fato era). Beneficiado ainda por um desenho de som brilhante que atinge um de seus melhores momentos na cena em que o êxito da bomba é celebrado por uma plateia em júbilo e durante a qual alguns dos brados empolgados são transformados em gritos de pânico (e que também sabe utilizar o silêncio com inteligência, como na sequência que gira em torno de Trinity, como o primeiro teste da bomba foi batizado), Oppenheimer em vários instantes soa como um pesadelo que atormenta não só o protagonista, mas toda a humanidade.

"Aug 7, 2023",positive," Christopher Nolan’s OPPENHEIMER demands that we consider the father of the atomic bomb’s life in context, the which he does with stunning clarity considering the paradoxes the film considers. Like the quantum world revealed by the new physics that Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) brought to the United States between the world wars, things can work even if the underpinnings of why defy rational explanation. That can mean a relationship between adults, or the construction of a bomb that will change the world even if the math behind it doesn’t work. Searching for the reality behind it is, as opined by a character, fruitless, even if it is a fascinating intellectual exercise. And that is what Nolan has constructed here, a peerless intellectual thriller told with urgency and embracing the paradox until it resolves into a bittersweet poetic sort of justice proving Einstein’s (here an an avuncular Tom Conti) conjecture that God does not play dice. Told in flashbacks and flashforwards, the narrative structure mimics the fluidity of time in that ci-mentioned quantum world. The facts of Oppenheimer’s life are stripped down to details that move the story along without weighing it down. Key moments and elegantly simple montages telescope time and speak to the revolution in physics, as well as the culture, that enthralled Oppenheimer, including the left-leaning politics that would come to haunt him. They also highlight the contradictions of a troubled young man who once tried to poison a tutor that he particularly liked. These resolve themselves into a man who is both a genius and an innocent, who understands that theory will only get you so far, as he puts it, but who is continually baffled by the shifting realpolitik of life where everything is relative. Again, thank you Albert. Shifting between color and black & white, between Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing before the Gray Board in 1954, and the Senate hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) in 1959, a proceeding that comes to hinge on the former, Oppenheimer’s life from troubled post-grad with no talent for experimental physics, to the most influential scientist of his day is recounted, not chronologically, but in a series of juxtapositions that compare and contrast testimony while also creating an atmosphere of intrigue and danger that ranks with the very best suspense films. Underpinning that is Nolan’s dialogue of rigorous precision that, ahem, paradoxically exposes the vagaries of language, be it a mathematical formula or a cross-examination or a defining the end of the world as we know it. It is the mark of a master that he can take an incident, in this case the explosion of the first atomic bomb, and make it unbearably tense. Yet Nolan does just that. With skillful editing, a hand (Josh Peck in a pivotal role) hovering over a large red button, and jittery set of strings building to a musical crescendo that explodes into silence, the Trinity explosion telegraphs not just the uncertainty of what will happen when the countdown reaches zero, but the weight of two hundred years of physics distilled down to a moment that might end life on the planet, or prove that that everything they believe is wrong. Here and throughout, Nolan gives us the facts, and the revelations, but also judicious foreshadowing by externalizing Oppenheimer’s inner struggle to navigate the real world with cuts to the quantum world that obsesses him. Murphy, and his incandescent blue eyes, capture that peculiar innocence and passionate curiosity that comes of living in a reality that is only tangential to the rest of the world’s. Stymied by the imprecision of language, and adhering to a moral certitude that may be evolved, may be misguided, might very well be both, it results in his crowning achievement and his downfall. The innocence has a childlike quality that expects the world to make sense, and a delicacy that is continually surprised and wounded when it isn’t. That world is populated by great love Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) whose emotional instability is matched only by her own passion and intelligence, and wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), a whip-smart, emphasis on whip, biologist at a time when the world had no use for one. Her own instability, so often glibly pigeon-holed as “difficult”, is presented with compassion, and the relationship she had with Oppenheimer is less analyzed than explicated in all its messy complexity as something that worked for them, and that without which, neither would have been able to thrive, leaving us with the pointed question, who are we to judge? The early days in Europe learning the new physics bring us Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) who sees Oppenheimer’s potential being wasted, Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz) who overlooks Oppenheimer’s innocent (there’s that word again) arrogance to become his biggest supporter in good times and bad, as well as the voice of ethics and reason. The Manhattan Project, four years and $2 billion, brings Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) as the ultimate pragmatist, tasked with wrangling the best minds at his disposal to do the impossible and build the atom bomb before the Nazis do; the formidably arrogant Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) playing with paper airplanes to emphasize his contempt for everyone around him, and Lt. Col. Nichols (Dane deHaan) as the ultimate functionary, as easily imagined, like the head of security, Col. Boris Pash (Casey Affleck), heiling as saluting if an accident of birth had landed them in Germany rather than America. Then there is Strauss, politically entwined with Oppenheimer, the embodiment of vain egotism and the ultimate politician untethered to anything but power. Downy’s performance is never simple and has the underpinnings of a tragic hero in a mold diametrically different from that of Oppenheimer, and in its own way, replete as it is with a self-awareness that Oppenheimer lacked, the quintessence of tragedy. OPPENHEIMER is a masterpiece of image and word, of complex ideas made manifest, and all kept at a very human level to maintain that constant immediacy. I sincerely hope that there is a longer director’s cut, if only to extend the pleasure of watching an artist at work. And maybe giving Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid), more than a few words and some bongo riffs. Very impressive, probably one of the most thorough and incisive biopic in a long time. Would be a gross injustice for it not to receive Academy Award consideration for best pic and Murphy for best actor."
"Aug 6, 2023",positive,"One of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that Nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects’ contradictions. If anything, he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable. Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?"
"Aug 5, 2023",positive," It’s often said that the victors write history. Although the Allies won World War II, who ‘won’ the battle for influence and power within American politics and society in the aftermath of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is a more difficult question to untangle. OPPENHEIMER doesn’t necessarily seek to do so, but its shifting chronology charts the personal viewpoints of those involved in these global conflicts. Chief among those figures is J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the director of the Los Alamos laboratory and Manhattan Project. The film jumps across different periods of his life (progressing linearly but intercut in a typical piece of Nolan time manipulation) from his early studies, through the development of the atomic bomb and its deployment, the decision to strip his security clearance in 1954 at the height of the post-War Red Scare period, to Lewis Strauss’ (Robert Downey Jnr.) confirmation hearings for a US cabinet post in 1959 (where there was a strand of questioning over his role in ‘the Oppenheimer affair’). The entwined time periods have a slightly disorienting effect as the film establishes itself, whirling at breakneck speed from a young-looking Cillian Murphy, through Oppenheimer’s tenure at Lewis Strauss’s Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, to a somewhat more haggard and aged appearance at the 1954 hearings. However, without the needlessly complex mechanics of TENET to contend with (their first collaboration), Nolan’s second film with editor Jennifer Lame bears more fruit this time. The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy. “The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy.” The bomb’s development and the Trinity test are, naturally, the plot’s pivot points. Still, the structure of OPPENHEIMER lends that literal explosive force metaphorically to the lead-up and aftermath of the detonation, conferring the same sense of urgency and impact. The film successfully imbues the postwar period with rising panic (the film’s final moments become a horrifying pit of dread) and the pre-bombing build-up with a horrible sense of inevitability. The chain reaction is not the literal one of a nuclear fission device but the paranoia, fear, and response it unleashed. A more conventional and linear biopic approach covering the time depicted here would probably be described as a ‘slow burn’ and perhaps a film that ‘peters out’, but OPPENHEIMER is neither despite its substantial three-hour runtime. Every scene beats with an urgency no matter the period depicted. In particular, the decision to also focus segments of the film around Lewis Strauss’ 1959 senate confirmation hearings puts American politics and society squarely in the story’s blast radius. How did America’s individualism as a country contribute to how the bomb’s development and deployment played out? How did a failure to reconcile the celebrated individualism of its citizens against mistrust of non-conformism impact the post-war world? Strauss heralds the Institute for Advanced Study to Oppenheimer as “a haven for independent minds”, and Oppenheimer is feted with celebrity for his individual rhetorical flair and scientific aptitude. Yet, his non-conformism with previous left-wing attitudes, communist associations, and penchant for collective action place a cloud over his proclamations for measures to control nuclear proliferation and opposition to the subsequent development of the hydrogen bomb. The sense of individual exceptionalism – for both the USA and its great minds – hurtles the world to the atomic age and the Cold War. The distrust of non-conformist figures and collective action perpetuates that conflict indefinitely, an escalating positive feedback cycle that many thought could (and maybe still will) bring about Armageddon. “American politics and society squarely in the story’s blast radius. How did America’s individualism as a country contribute to how the bomb’s development and deployment played out? How did a failure to reconcile the celebrated individualism of its citizens against mistrust of non-conformism impact the post-war world?” The spectre of the US government apparatus hangs over the response to the atomic bomb’s deployment. Lewis Strauss’s role here comes down to his confirmation hearing in a reasonably minor cabinet role, which shows the global ramifications are viewed by many depicted here through a very insular prism. In this regard, it heightens the impact of this narrow focus that the effect on Japan goes unexamined. To do so would afford a global perspective many of the figures depicted in the film are simply not concerned about, aptly demonstrated by the depiction of US Secretary of War Henry Stimson, who spares Kyoto on account of having honeymooned there. Much is also made of how Oppenheimer’s left-wing leanings make him easier to control for General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who at one point barks, “You have the rights I give to you – no more, no less!” “The spectre of the US government apparatus hangs over the response to the atomic bomb’s deployment. Lewis Strauss’s role here comes down to his confirmation hearing in a reasonably minor cabinet role, which shows the global ramifications are viewed by many depicted here through a very insular prism.” Robert Downey Jnr. is the perfect vessel for Strauss, deploying an affable arrogance weaponised to hide that his frame of mind is almost the inversion of Oppenheimer’s. Strauss uses conciliatory charm and fig leaves of cooperation to hide a ruthless individualism and sense of entitlement. In contrast, Oppenheimer’s individual brilliance and personal arrogance undermine a communitarian world outlook and preference for collective action. The film is not perfect by any means and bears some of the less effective hallmarks of Nolan’s recent work. Alden Ehrenreich’s role degenerates into the most recent example of expository vessels that have recurred in Nolan’s work, his advisor firing out leading questions like ChatGPT prompts, constructing open goals for Downey Jnr. to lay out the plot or character motivations. Composer Ludwig Göransson’s second collaboration fares better than the migraine-inducing TENET score but lacks either the impact of his work elsewhere (especially his work on The Mandalorian or with Ryan Coogler on CREED or BLACK PANTHER) or the emotional clarity of Nolan’s work with Hans Zimmer. However, the insistent drive of the film and the terrifically involving performances – no more so than Cillian Murphy’s – allow the film’s shockwave to hit regardless. Focusing on personal viewpoints for this globally significant development may seem curiously narrow. Still, OPPENHEIMER achieves what the best biopics often do: using the personal lens to foreground and examine the wider ramifications of events. There are no more significant potential ramifications than the end of the world, and that awful looming mushroom cloud haunts every frame of this tense and emotionally violent portrait."
"Aug 5, 2023",neutral," Directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer follows Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer as he progresses through his rigorous studies to become the director of World War II’s infamous Manhattan Project. Filmmaker Nolan, armed with his own script, delivers a technically-impressive yet mostly underwhelming drama that admittedly does start with some promise, as the movie, which runs a punishing 180 minutes, boasts a striking opening stretch that contains all of the hallmarks and touchstones associated with Nolan’s work – including eye-popping visuals, an intense, ceaseless score, and several electrifying stand-alone interludes and sequences. (The inevitable Trinity test interlude is as astonishing and enthralling as one might’ve imagined, for example.) There’s little doubt, then, that Oppenheimer‘s downfall is due primarily to its exhaustingly dense (and egregiously propulsive) narrative, with the picture progressing into a relentless midsection that contains hardly anything in the way of breathing room – which, in turn, ensures that the second half increasingly adopts an anticlimactic, endless feel (ie virtually everything that comes after the Trinity set-piece can’t help but come off as needless and somewhat interminable). The film’s relative failure is especially disappointing given its proliferation of engrossing attributes, including spellbinding performances by Murphy and his myriad of costars and a handful of engrossing quieter moments (eg James Remar’s Secretary of War attempts to decide where in Japan the bomb should be dropped), and it does seem apparent, ultimately, that Oppenheimer would’ve benefited from a more sedate (and traditional) approach to its inherently compelling subject matter."
"Aug 4, 2023",positive," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, Oppenheimer, the movie being covered here, wouldn’t exist. One of the most anticipated movies of the year, you would hope that Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer will live up to the hype. And boy does it. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer tells the story of the physicist who is responsible for the creation of the Atomic bomb — and the moral questions that came along with that work. The movie spends much of its first hour on exposition to show what kind of man Robert Oppenheimer was. And to be clear, we’re talking about him as a character from this point forward. The audience sees him as a brilliant scientist who doesn’t quite fit in. He’s a man who has a loneliness about him, who is often trapped by the inner workings of his mind. Yet the point isn’t to feel sorry for him. He’s narcissistic and has it in his heart to inject an apple with cyanide to get back at an instructor who shames him in the lab. This scene ultimately foreshadows the rest of the film. While Robert is capable of injecting an apple with poison, knowing full well what the purpose of doing so is, his conscience catches up to him and he races to stop the man from eating the poisoned apple. Robert eventually moves to Germany to study Quantum Mechanics. Being a Jewish man there at that time complicates matters, something the film could have done well to explore a bit more than it does. Yes, it’s a three-hour movie, which is over-the-top for any film, yet there are plenty of times the film rushes past important moments and glosses over characters that deserve a little more attention. There’s no question this is an extremely male movie. It’s based in history, so it’s not shocking that the key characters are all white men. However, Robert’s relationships with Jean (Florence Pugh) and Kitty (Emily Blunt) are so central to the man he is and the man he evolves to be throughout the film. Both women, and those stories, aren’t given enough screen time. It’s a shame to see Pugh and Blunt underutilized in this way. They each give incredible performances, no doubt, but even fleshing out their stories just a tiny bit more would have made this film more satisfying. In particular, it’s disappointing that more attention isn’t given to the way Robert and Kitty struggle with Peter as a baby, or to Jean’s eventual suicide. The film remains breathtaking and deeply emotional despite those flaws, though. The way the story unfolds, with flashbacks and transitions from color to black-and-white, allows for a more artful narrative as the audience puts the pieces together to understand the mistakes Robert made — and what was out of his hands entirely. What Oppenheimer does is leads the audience to actually root for, at least on some level, the success of the bomb that Oppenheimer has been asked — er, told — to work on. The justification is that it’s the only way to end the war altogether, but more than that, the audience is brought along for the journey of a great science experiment. Brilliant scientists gather together in a town created for just this purpose. They bring their families to Los Alamos and pour everything they have into making the bomb a reality. Their hard work and their sacrifices become the key focus, Robert’s included. So when the scientists finally test the bomb, it’s the beauty of it that takes center stage. The explosion is presented in magnificent, gorgeous detail. It’s astounding, colorful, artistic, and silent — until it isn’t. The sound comes crashing in startling form to signify just how terrifying this weapon could be. But the moment that really matters, the one that leaves a pit in your stomach, is when the scientists learn that the bomb has been dropped over Hiroshima. Again, it’s a scene presented in artistic detail, flashing back and forth between cheers and reactions of guilt and sickness. And as Robert is to speak about its success, what he sees instead is the damage that’s been done, in every horrifying, unsettling image. Cillian Murphy’s portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer is incredible throughout the film, but this may be the standout moment. He makes the audience every conflicted feeling he does, and it’s gutwrenching. There is more to this story, however. As Robert battles his guilt over what he’s helped create, and fights fame, he hopes to prevent the government from using this as a stepping stone to create something worse. And all the while, he comes to be accused of leaking information. While this part of the film is perhaps the least interesting overall, it reveals the motives of the people around him, and it serves, narratively, as a way to explain key parts of his character throughout the film. It also reveals his downfall and eventually leads the film to what is perhaps its most poignant message. There was always the possibility, as the scientists work to create the bomb, that it could start a chain reaction that may never end. And ultimately, it did. As emotional, beautiful, and thought-provoking as this film is, it’s that much more powerful because it’s based on historical events. It’s a film I won’t be able to shake for a long time.

"Aug 4, 2023",positive," “Oppenheimer,” the extraordinary film written and directed by the redoubtable Christopher Nolan, tackles not just the history of one man and the seminal event that came to define him, but also the complex intersection of science, politics and the cult of personality. Rarely have I left a movie feeling smarter than when I went in, but “Oppenheimer” is just such a film and it elevated my thinking, especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science. More amazingly, I still don’t understand physics beyond Newton’s third law of motion that “every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” And yet, curiously, that quote also applies to the emotional reactions of the protagonists in the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the Atomic Bomb. Based on what is arguably considered the best biography written about Oppenheimer, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin who spent 25 years researching and writing it, Nolan took this base material and focused on the successful attempt to dismantle Oppenheimer’s reputation, building the background by going backwards and forwards in Oppenheimer’s life. Much like Prometheus, the Greek god of fire who was punished by Zeus for giving fire to humans, the post World War II life of Robert Oppenheimer doomed him to serve penance for what many saw as conceit compounded by his many human frailties—sexual, political and intellectual. But this modern day Prometheus who unleashed the  power of atomic energy could be more closely associated with Icarus, the mortal who dared to fly too close to the sun. In Greek mythology, Icarus and Daedalus, his father, devised wings made of threads, feathers and wax to flee their labyrinthian prison. His father warned him to beware of the sins of hubris and complacency, advising him not to fly too high lest the sun melt his wings. But Icarus refused to listen and the sun melted his wings, whereupon he fell into the sea and drowned. And a labyrinth of storytelling is what this movie is. Tracking between time frames in his life, Nolan smoothly transitions from the 1953-54 Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Kangaroo Court instigated by AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss to relieve Oppenheimer of his security clearance, to Oppenheimer’s early career as he finds his way to theoretical physics in England and Germany. From his ambivalent dabbling in left wing and Communist circles, to his leadership in the Los Alamos branch of the Manhattan Project, the vast, decentralized program to harness nuclear fusion and create enough energy to power an atomic bomb, and the consequences of Strauss’s harassment of an intellectual foe with a still deep base of support from the scientific heavyweights of the time. In poker terms, this is a study of the consequences of overplaying your hand.  It is a complicated story centered on a complex individual who is understood by many and misunderstood by most. Oppenheimer’s initial focus was in chemistry, his major at Harvard, but he soon found his way to physics and pursued that course at Cambridge. It was there that he discovered he loathed lab studies and was unsuited for experimental physics. An encounter with Max Born (Nobel Prize 1959) led him to the University of Göttingen in Germany where the field of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics were starting to take hold. Under the tutelage of Born, Oppenheimer received his PhD in 1927. It was here that he encountered and befriended future theoretical physics giants such as Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan, both pioneers in quantum mechanics and future Nazis. Also with him at Göttingen were Edward Teller and future Nobelists Erwin Schrödinger (as in the cat), Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli and Enrico Fermi. Fermi would later lead the University of Chicago section of the Manhattan Project; Teller would join Oppenheimer in Los Alamos. Returning to the United States, Oppenheimer received appointments at both CalTech and Berkeley. His residency at Berkeley was significant both for his championing and establishing a group focusing on theoretical physics, where none previously existed, and his association with experimental physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, the pioneer of the cyclotron that would be instrumental in developing the atomic bomb. It was also at Berkeley, a bastion of left wing ideology long before the 1960s, that Oppenheimer flirted with Communism, never joining but always cavorting. His brother Frank, urged on by his wife at the time, joined, and Oppenheimer’s lover, the volatile Jean Tatlock, was an active member. Oppenheimer’s political leanings were decidedly to the left of center, possibly far left, but his ambivalence was probably more fueled by his avoidance of being identified as one thing or another. Thus, all sides of the pro and anti equation thought he was something he wasn’t.  As war started to rear its head in Europe and rumors of Jewish annihilation in Nazi Germany began to surface, Einstein, now living in the United States, wrote a letter to President Roosevelt warning him that Germany was researching the use of uranium in bombs and that the U.S. needed to begin such a project immediately. Thus were born the seeds of the Manhattan Project, a multi-pronged, rather decentralized program to harness the new physics of the atom into practical military usage. General (or soon to be) Leslie Groves was appointed to head the project and choose the sites for research as well as those individuals to head up each division. In typical Army thinking, Groves previous experience was in the construction of the Pentagon, something that was deemed suitable experience for supervising a high level physics project. But his skill area was actually in choosing the right people to head each program and he chose Oppenheimer, a curiously counter-intuitive selection based on his assumed politics and lack of managerial expertise, for the Los Alamos project, a site suggested by Oppenheimer. It is Strauss’s animus that shades so much of the film. By the time they first meet, it is after the war and Strauss offers the now famous and lauded Oppenheimer the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, long the home of Einstein. It is here that Strauss’s multi-pronged hostility takes root when he is convinced that Oppenheimer turned Einstein against him. Whether this actually happened or not, what is unmentioned is that Strauss, a Trustee of the Institute, was, himself, a candidate for the directorship. Losing it may have been hard (he was 5th choice) but having to give it to a left winger like Oppenheimer was a humiliation, but only the first. Strauss, a Jew committed to many religious organizations, was disdainful of Oppenheimer’s secular attitude. A wealthy, self-made man without a college education, Strauss was both proud and defensive of his origins.  Strike two came later when Oppenheimer, as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the newly formed AEC ridiculed Strauss’s position that the humanitarian provision of radio isotopes to our allies was a security risk. Worse, the full AEC board, of which Strauss was a member, voted four to one to release the isotopes, leaving Strauss on the fringes.  Returning to the Los Alamos years, Oppenheimer, Oppie as he was affectionately called, made sure that Groves’ dictum that all research be compartmentalized for security reasons was followed, at least in practicality if not in spirit. Alien to Oppenheimer’s nature, he created committees and subgroups across divisions that discussed relevant findings that could dovetail into furthering the work and speeding their results.  As chronological as this retelling may be, the most important takeaways about Oppenheimer’s personality are his inclusiveness and ability to stay out of the way of the men he hand picked. His brilliance, as viewed by others, was his incisive mind; but from my standpoint, his brilliance was in recognizing his own intellectual shortcomings and refusing to interfere in arenas where others had skills that surpassed his own. Of the scientists he chose to join him in Los Alamos, seventeen would go on to win Nobel Prizes. Abraham Pais, a colleague of Oppenheimer’s at the Institute for Advanced Study, said of him “there was no greater satisfaction for him than to see such efforts bear fruit and then to tell others of the work that someone had done.” (“J. Robert Oppenheimer: A Biographical Memoir” by H.A. Bethe. National Academy of Sciences.) Oftentimes accused of arrogance, I believe it was more a recognition of his own worth that may have grated on those who did not fly in his circle and Strauss was one who did not. Humility is generally not a characteristic associated with genius. To quote David Lillianthal, first chairman of the AEC: “He was the only authentic genius I have ever met.” But there is no doubt that our modern day Icarus flew too close to the sun. He was against the creation of the Hydrogen Bomb and nuclear proliferation, both loudly supported by Edward Teller and Lewis Strauss. Never apologizing for the use of the atomic bomb on Japan, Oppenheimer campaigned against its further implementation. Teller never forgave Oppenheimer for not pursuing his model of the Hydrogen Bomb at Los Alamos despite the fact that Oppenheimer allowed him to continue his research on this infinitely more powerful weapon undisturbed. That Teller testified against him at Strauss’s 1953-54 hearing would eventually have negative consequences on Teller’s acceptance in the academic community.  Oppenheimer’s inability to control his libido didn’t help him in his personal life, choosing his paramours from among the wives of his colleagues. His own marriage and its shotgun aspect may have fueled some of his ambivalence to fidelity but his leanings were well-established early on.  Nolan assembled a cast of thousands, well at least many, and all of them deliver some of the best work in their vast repertoires. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is a revelation of depth, drama, intelligence and complexity. He is in almost every frame and holds us in the intensity of his haunting blue-eyed gaze. Like others in this film, it is impossible to think of any other actor who could play this role. Nothing in his previous work with Nolan (“Dunkirk,” “Inception”) would lead you to believe that he would be the natural lead for a movie about one of the most important scientists of our time and yet he is. Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss gives the performance of his career, one that will allow you to forget that he has spent the last decade playing comic book superheroes. His Strauss is subtle, devious and duplicitous all couched smoothly in the skin of a patriot. The very embodiment of a paranoiac, Downey effectively conveys the feelings of the very smart when they encounter true genius. The dismay reveals itself in his body language as Strauss is left on the sidelines instead of the center to which he is accustomed. The expression “revenge is a dish best served cold” comes to mind as you witness the machinations played out tiny bit by tiny bit. Bland, almost obsequious in his early dealings with Oppenheimer, he is the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing, luring his surprisingly naive and blindered prey to cliff’s edge where only a tap on the back will yield the precipitous fall he has engineered almost from the start of their relationship. An unrecognizable Emily Blunt plays Kitty Oppenheimer, the long suffering and insufferable wife. The anger smoldering just below the surface and her overall dissatisfaction is one that she makes understandable to all who would laud her husband. She is an actress of incredible range and Nolan successfully makes use of it.  There are far too many amazing actors, most of whom make a meal of the small roles they play. Foremost among them is Matt Damon as General Groves. One never doubts the seriousness of his task and yet Damon is able to leaven many of his moments with a subtle humor that makes you smile. His was one of my favorite roles.  Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock as the unhinged and passionate temptation that Oppenheimer is never able to resist. Josh Hartnett portrays Ernest Lawrence as a charmer, one who is comfortable in his brilliant skin. Tom Conti has a wonderful cameo as Einstein and Benny Safdie is a very petulant Edward Teller who can see no other way than his own. Gustaf Skarsgård, son of Stellan and brother of Alexander, is a sympathetic Hans Bethe, a friend through thick and thin of Oppenheimer, but then again, Oppie probably didn’t sleep with his wife. Kenneth Branaugh plays Niels Bohr (interesting side note, Bohr’s son Aage Neils Bohr worked alongside him in Los Alamos and would also go on to win his own Nobel Prize, making them one of the only father-son Nobelists). And, in a notable role as Roger Robb, the vengeful Strauss loyalist and lead of the secret committee meeting to emasculate Openheimer, Jason Clarke gives the kind of chilling performance that makes the hair on your arms stand up. But these are only a few of the more recognizable actors among the many, many fantastic men and women who play noticeable roles in “Oppenheimer.” The score by Ludwig Göransson pulsates and underpins the action sequences and those of the lushly filmed light explosions. The music heightens the urgency attached to the work in Los Alamos. Shot gloriously in Imax by Hoyte Van Hoytema, he has captured lightning in a bottle with his clips of light explosions and chemical reactions that fill the screen. He has made the desert, almost a moonscape, another character in the film. See “Oppenheimer” in a theater and on an IMAX or XD formatted screen if at all possible. Cinematically, emotionally, this movie carves out a world that is filled, in equal measures, with optimism and despair. Oppenheimer and “Oppenheimer” are more than the sum of their respective parts.

"Aug 4, 2023",positive," Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s 12th feature film and perhaps his most ambitious yet. That’s saying something considering this is the director of challenging epics such as Interstellar, Dunkirk and Tenet, the latter arguably being one of Nolan’s weakest films.  Oppenheimer is definitely a step up from Tenet; a much more relatable and human story and one that bears a huge historical significance. Nolan attacks J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story head-on, attempting to understand a complex man who would go on to be credited as the ‘Father of the Atomic Bomb’.  Here, he is presented as a man with a sense of uncompromising vision and purpose, but one who would become haunted by the part he played in history.  As we’ve already seen from the impressive trailers, Oppenheimer unfolds both in colour and black-and-white sequences. Nolan has already commented on this choice, with colour scenes representing Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. The black-and-white unfold from the perspective of Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss and are more objective in nature.  The style choice proves a tad jarring at first. In fact, the entire first hour of Oppenheimer is rushed and packed to the brim with information which is near-impossible to absorb. Nolan throws characters, names, places and science-y words at us at a dizzying pace and it becomes exhausting.  Thankfully, after that first hour, Oppenheimer really finds its groove. The dual timeline follows Oppenheimer as he attempts to build a bomb to “end all wars” as well as the fallout from that as he is, years later, sitting in front of a security council, being questioned about his past relationships and intentions.  The difference between Oppenheimer in 1942 and 1954 is staggering. Not so much because of any make-up or VFX tricks to age actor Cillian Murphy, but the haunted look on the actor’s face. Murphy is simply extraordinary as Oppenheimer, a man driven by blind ambition and aimless innovation.  Murphy is supported by the very handsome and talented cast around him. Out of the large – too large, you might say – cast, Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, stand out. Downey Jr. is remarkable in a tricky role that’s far-removed from his witty public persona and his role as Tony Stark in the MCU.  But Oppenheimer is definitely a bit of a sausage fest. While Blunt is sharp as Kitty, Nolan’s writing is flawed when it comes to his female characters. Oppenheimer includes Nolan’s first sex scene and it’s exactly as you’d imagine it; unfussy, straight to the point and a little awkward.  Florence Pugh plays Oppenheimer’s early girlfriend Jean Tatlock. She only has roughly 15 minutes of screentime, but Pugh makes the most of it, even though a large portion of the role requires being naked. Without spoiling too much, Kitty and Jean’s characterisations feel a little old-fashioned and troubling. There simply doesn’t seem to be time or any real effort to build or develop the women in Oppenheimer’s life.  Ludwig Göransson’s score, as expected, is magnificent, but heavily planted in some scenes, which marginally eats away some of the film’s magic. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s cinematography is awe-inspiring and Nolan, a pragmatic, economic director, certainly knows how to frame a shot and find the essence of every scene.  The tight close-ups on Oppenheimer tell us more about him than any line of dialogue ever could and a sequence where the crew tests the bomb might be the finest scene we’ll see on the big screen this year. Nolan has previously stated that the film is a little bit of a horror film and that statement feels correct; there is something utterly horrifying about Oppenheimer’s story, but crucially, Nolan never defends or judges him.  Nolan also never shows us any of the destruction that Oppenheimer’s creation leaves behind. Oppenheimer casually mentions the land they have built the testing site and an entire town should be given “back to the Indians”, but for the most part, Oppenheimer is another story about a white man’s guilt without any input from the communities that were affected by his actions.  Oppenheimer, much like its titular character, slightly falls victim to its own, endless ambition. The film’s sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy, but more often than not, Nolan’s filmmaking soars. Nolan, who has always been accused of being unemotional and cold as a storyteller, has crafted his most humane film yet.  ★★★★☆

"Aug 3, 2023",positive," TEXAS, USA — It’s telling that Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” – a mammoth drama that zips through montages of men talking in congressional chambers, scientific labs, and New Mexico deserts where history will eventually come alive with blinding light and a gut-level reaction like few directors can achieve on this scale – ends suddenly. What we’re left with is a note of mystery over whether we’ve really seen it all.  It could be because the political power games that stuffed and sometimes stifled the events of the previous three hours are finally revealed as what they were: Petty Washington squabbling failing to take full stock of the godly power that’s been delivered by the movie’s eponymous physicist until doom dawns behind the globe-sized eyes of the actor playing him. For as much as Nolan’s epics traffic in mind-melting rules (at least until shattering them with an IMAX-screen-sized mallet) the British filmmaker also loves leaving us with a tinge of cosmic ambiguity. And Cillian Murphy – playing J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, in a rare and welcome leading part – comes equipped with a gaze able to channel that ambiguity with startling clarity.  It could also be that “Oppenheimer” simply hasn’t earned the moment. Ever since “Inception,” every new Nolan film has felt like a summation of what he’s been building up to; his movies may be cold, but coldness is the natural destination for his characters once they’ve been humbled by their own sheer brilliance. Bruce Wayne and Alfred Borden and Dom Cobb eventually come face to face with the worlds of their own making—as does J. Robert Oppenheimer, among the most brilliant of Nolan protagonists, if the slow-onset psychological devastation we come to witness is any indication. Yet at times in this 180-minute saga, it can seem like Nolan – working from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography ""American Prometheus"" – obfuscates the full depths of his subject’s burden, undercutting the very subjectivity that sets the movie’s best sequences ablaze with the consequences of ostensibly heroic actions. “Theory can only take you so far,” Oppenheimer says at one point. Indeed.  Oppenheimer was a physicist but “Oppenheimer” is as sturdy a feat of cinematic engineering as any of Nolan’s prior efforts. Nolan approaches his stories like Rubik’s cubes, which here means we’re kept on our toes so as not to stumble under the constantly shifting tectonic plates of his script. The movie opens several years after the bomb has been dropped in 1945, foregrounding the political rivalry that blossomed between former associates Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) in the ‘50s. Mired in separate uphill battles whose atoms nonetheless jump to each others’ orbits – the scientist trying to retain national security clearance amid accusations of once-upon-a-time Communist activity, the politician trying to be confirmed for a cabinet position – this latter timeline serves as the arena in which J. Robert Oppenheimer’s experiences will be recalled and recounted, and in exacting, sometimes challenging detail. You can understand why: The McCarthyism of the 1950s made no concessions for the privacy of its targets.  The shifting proximities of timelines and motivations in “Oppenheimer” – most of it presented in color, some of the latter-chronology scenes in black-and-white – unfold with thrilling rhythm, tightly weaving the dense tapestry of people and places key to Oppenheimer’s burgeoning role in the war and world to come. These include his time learning in Europe as a promising young talent, an eventual arrival in Berkeley and his interests in radical methods to solve the world’s issues, much to the chagrin of school administration. Eventually he’s recruited  into a secret military project whose objective Oppenheimer is smart enough to infer simply by paying attention: The Germans are turning to science to build a massive new weapon, and the Americans surely are off to their own pursuit.  The directive set forth in Nolan’s last film, “Tenet,” was that its confusing backwards-is-forwards-is-backwards chalkboard logic didn’t matter so long as you surrender to the sensory thrills of watching it in practice. “Oppenheimer” is a much better film than that one, but we’re expected to play by different rules: That is, you’d better pay attention. For as much as “Oppenheimer” showcases the director’s knack for harmonizing music, image and sound into engrossing cinema, the movie’s momentum has a way of cobbling storytelling intentions back together just as they’re on the verge of crumbling. A moment arrives when, before heading to Los Alamos to direct the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), declares, “Everything’s changing.” We know what she means in practical terms. But at certain junctures in the story we can hardly appreciate what’s to come when the sights of where we just were were fleeting.  This kind of narrative propulsion isn’t new for Nolan, who over the years has made a convincing thematic case out of the disorientation his movies sometimes afflict us with. And yet, the film’s speed – necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study – is a bit like a trick in itself, both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that Oppenheimer himself rarely did. He was a careful and calculating scientist in the eyes of his colleagues, while at home he cheated on Kitty and struggled with mental torment as a young man. He was attracted to a challenge, but we come to wonder if this wasn’t out of self-preservation. He understood the importance of strategy, but he was also impulsive.  The showcasing of these contradictions play out in the movie’s first hour like necessary legwork, the elements and components of an equation being carefully applied before a result to be divulged much later in the film reveals the truth behind what Oppenheimer is remembering. And also how this is all being remembered: Occasionally “Oppenheimer” will sprinkle in an astounding few frames of atoms suspended in space, of fleeting apocalyptic imagery, of particles spinning so fast they resemble a film reel. It’s apparent this is more than just a way to get us cinematically invested in the science beyond terminology the average moviegoer won’t understand—it could very well be that, in Nolan’s estimation, Robert clung to the inexplicable in order to make sense of what was in front of him, on newspapers and the tired faces of lovers who continue to haunt him. What’s clear is that “Oppenheimer” acknowledges a moral complexity that its subject willfully, desperately blinded himself to.  Nowhere is this more apparent than the movie’s faces, and you’ll recognize a great many in the sprawling cast of “Oppenheimer.” The filmmaker has on occasion created moviegoing experiences worthy of the term “magical,” yet it’s hard to think of a bigger trick he’ll pulled off than revealing that the most consistently deployed spectacle of “Oppenheimer,” one of the biggest post-COVID movie events, lies in the crevices and frowns and reactions of his performers. Among the carousel are Oscar winners with just a handful of lines (Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Casey Affleck) and actors we haven’t seen enlisted for such gravely material in some time (Josh Hartnett, Downey Jr., Kenneth Branagh). There is the dadcore energy of Matt Damon, playing Los Alamo’s military leader opposite Murphy’s scientific one, and the intensity of Blunt, who is able to spin her character's one-dimensionality into a wrenching initial sign that Oppenheimer must and will confront himself.  And there’s Murphy himself, whose few opportunities in major leading roles over the years feels like the result of Hollywood not quite knowing how to approach the mysterious energy emanating from the canyons of his jawline, the alluring blue of his eyes that can turn from villainous to boyish to supremely melancholic in an instant. He is a magnetic central force as J. Robert Oppenheimer, his internal tug-of-war between fighting for the present and despairing for the future asserting itself even in moments that feel most like straightforward presentation of history. That he remains the anchor amid a cast as wide as one of the film's vistas as captured by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema speaks to Nolan’s own triumph, as well as to the frustrations that can spring when dialogue is delivered in such a way that advances story while leaving mood simmering at too low a frequency.  It’s telling that Nolan pumps the brakes on his timeline-ricocheting for the showstopper sequence of the Manhattan’s Project’s explosive exam in New Mexico. Ludwig Göransson’s mighty score lends us a hand throughout the film by establishing the tone and tenor, but there isn’t a stronger auditory cue than the sound of a crackling Geiger Counter accompanying our first glimpse at the construction of Oppie’s “gadget,” a gripping buildup where talk of science and potential treason gives way to prolonged anticipation and, eventually, one of the most spectacularly horrifying – or is that horrifyingly spectacular? – images in recent American cinema. Once the various players on screen start scrambling and the intimidating image of an isolated derrick in the desert asserts itself, you begin to sit a little straighter. This is all to say you may occasionally forget the events of “Oppenheimer” revolve around security clearances and bombs, an impressive recalculation that underscores the complicated endeavor Nolan has set forth for himself: How does one recount an incredible historical event whose implications could only truly be appreciated in hindsight, once the flash of scientific triumph gave way to the aftermath of destructive power? Nolan, for his part, is as forthright on the matter as his subject is devastated by it. I would advise you, dear reader, to pay close attention to a moment of self-confrontation that will test movie theaters’ sound systems to an even more deafening degree than the bomb itself… only I don’t have to, because there’s no missing it, and not in the least because the scene in question is the closest Nolan has ever come to outright horror while also accentuating the identity crisis faced by “Oppenheimer” (and Oppenheimer). On the one hand, the sequence in question shows Nolan reaching for the dizzying peak of his powers, the same mountaintop occupied by dreamscapes collapsing in on themselves and a prince of crime wreaking havoc. On the other, it puts into stark relief the comparative cruise-control of the movie’s looming final third, when Nolan struggles to keep the sting of moral bankruptcy alive amid streams of cross-cutting conversation threatening to submerge feelings of dread or poignancy entirely.  Perhaps this is how the movie was always going to feel, and should feel as a way of replicating the collision between brilliance and self-confrontation that few figures in history navigated on so stunning a scale as J. Robert Oppenhimer. As with most Nolan films, his latest will benefit from multiple viewings where timelines and ideas will surely click more tightly into place. But I also think he's aiming for audiences to pick their own way through the disorientation they’re likely to feel after their first screening; the swirling sense of confusion and anxiety you can make out through the toll of history but can’t quite shake off. Perhaps the reason we feel we haven't quite seen all we should by the end of ""Oppenheimer"" is because we're living it to this day."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," The conversation about who and what attracts moviegoers to theaters is usually centered on movie stars; it's very rarely focused on directors. Quentin Tarantino can still get people out to his movies in droves and so can Christopher Nolan, who will see great success with the opening of  ""Oppenheimer."" It's a testament to his stature as a filmmaker that theaters are selling out for a dense three-hour movie about the making of the atomic bomb. Nolan came from humble filmmaking roots with ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and the highly underrated police procedural ""Insomnia."" In 2005, he began his ""Batman"" trilogy and ever since then has been associated with bombastic movies. ""Oppenheimer"" is no different, but here Nolan fuses his big filmmaking techniques to tell a human story about process and invention, guilt and personal responsibility. After his last movie, 2020's obnoxious puzzle box ""Tenet,"" it's great to see Nolan return to working in this mode. Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist credited with the creation of the atomic bomb used during World War II. Murphy has been in several of Nolan's films, but has never been the lead - here he proves to be controlled and effective in guiding the entire movie. As a performer, Murphy has been typecast in villainous roles with his big-eyed stare, but there is so much acting going on with his eyes. A seemingly expressive look tells us so much about Oppenheimer's thoughts throughout the movie. Like most of Nolan's movies, he plays with the timeline and cuts back-and-forth because he wouldn't dare make a linear film at this point. ""Oppenheimer"" moves rather seamlessly between depositions, congressional hearings with eventual adversary Lewis Strauss (a terrific Robert Downey Jr.), and meetings with Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, occasionally playing it a bit too big), who oversaw the Manhattan Project. Mixed in is a glimpse of Oppenheimer's personal life, including his relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), and how they occasionally overlapped. Pugh is amassing a diverse filmography, but it appears she jumped at the chance to work with Nolan because her character feels like a plot device rather than a fully developed character. Blunt's character, for the majority of the movie, walks in-and-out of rooms guzzling booze, but Blunt gets a chance to shine in the last act. Nobody gives an icy stare like Blunt and she makes an impact in subtle and unexpected ways near the end. ""Oppenheimer"" is a big movie about men in suits talking, but watching the process pays off with the inevitable test sequence of the bomb, which is a moment that ranks among the best of Nolan's career. The sound design, Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography, Ludwig Goransson's score (which is arguably the star of the show at times), and the ensemble cast all converge in this moment and work in tandem to create a sequence that will make you hold your breath. Some air is let out of the movie in the final act because it becomes more focused on the deposition that is seen throughout, along with the congressional hearing. It's not as suspenseful as the crafting of the bomb, but still a necessary inclusion and helps turn ""Oppenheimer"" into a morality play. Nolan's movies have suffered from his bloated ambitions in the past, but ""Oppenheimer"" makes great use of its runtime."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," A majestic, mournful entertainment that’s as serious as a heart attack, ‘Oppenheimer’ is Christopher Nolan’s bullseye shot at Grand Statement cinema that’s about nothing less than human annihilation. It’s a meaty message movie brimming with Big Ideas and Weighty Themes, full of intense debates and furrowed-brow discussions, which also still uses its sinewy cinematic form to thrill and awe. Paced with a crisp, gripping efficiency for all of its eye-popping three-hour length, the filmmaker’s first biopic focuses its subjective eye on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), whom the press coronated as the “father of the atomic bomb.” He would be wracked with guilt the rest of his life for the quantum leap he unleashed, and then pilloried and slandered for voicing such anti-nuke agony—fully embodying his nickname as the modern Prometheus. But buyer, beware: ‘Oppenheimer’ is not a popcorn-picture confection. This dense examination/cross-examination of the man whose impactful deeds inarguably ended World War Two and started the Cold War is the story of a genius, after all, told with keen insight and an earnest ability to parcel out an arsenal of facts. Any movie that name-checks Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, T.S. Eliot, John Dunne, Sigmund Freud, and Karl Marx expects a baseline level of cultural engagement from its audience. And those paradigm-shifting canonical brethren are just the comparatively low-hanging fruit of its liberal-arts sophistication. Come prepared for a heady ride, with blink-or-you’ll-miss-them cameos from the superstars of modern physics that few people even know anyway. Is that foundational Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) commanding a near-Beatlemania fervor in the corridors of 1920s European academia? Who’s that walking with Einstein in Princeton’s woods with a short, single line of dialogue—could it be Austrian logician Kurt Gödel (James Urbaniak), fresh from fleeing the Nazis? And what’s that we see for a hot second behind pioneering nuclear physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett)—the prototype for a particle accelerator? Recognize them or not, these are the people whose passionate work effectively birthed the modern world as we know it. Nolan uses his impressive stable of Hollywood stars—and enough recognizable character actors—for good reason, not as stunt casting but as a shorthand for representing so many significant players in America’s race to build the world’s first atom bomb. When Matt Damon pops up as no-nonsense, bullshit-intolerant Brigadier General Leslie Groves, you know he’s going to be kind of a big deal. What else would you expect for the man who built the Pentagon and who the government has now charged with managing a kiloton-capable death machine? His most significant act: insisting that charismatic academic Oppenheimer be Scientific Director of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. Government’s shoot-the-moon nuclear weapons development program. Germany had split the uranium particle in 1938, and now, in 1943, Oppenheimer knew time—and the right mix of physicists and engineers—was critically important. One measure of cold comfort: he believed Hitler’s own prejudice against quantum mechanics, a still-pioneering discipline that he considered “Jewish science, ” would hobble him. “It’s paradoxical, and yet it works,” Oppenheimer enthuses to the first of his growing students at Berkeley when he explains the contradictory nuances of the burgeoning discipline, in which so much was still unproven. “My work is so…abstract,” he admits, implicitly acknowledging his yearning for a physical manifestation of his ideas. “All I have is theory.” No surprise that his intrepid drive, as well as his intuitive orchestration of idiosyncratic scientific personalities, were the deciding factors in the mercurial brainiacs’ eventual explosive success. What’s still astounding is the government’s ability to realize his vision. Oppenheimer knew they needed an isolated facility: he recommends his beloved New Mexico, specifically the barren area known as Los Alamos. He also knew that, in order to recruit the best and the brightest, he would need to have people bring their wives and children. So Groves builds him an entire town from scratch—houses, churches, hospitals, telephone poles, power lines and all. Three years, 4,000 people, and $2 billion later, Oppenheimer, Groves, and his men—all of them were men, by the way, bitterly supported by brilliant, resigned women sidelined due simply to their sex—are standing in front of a tower with “the gadget” in a pre-dawn test to change the world. The “I am become death, destroyer of worlds” detonation, dramatized with the full force of IMAX’s 70mm image and sound, is palpably terrifying, one of many choice moments throughout the film when Nolan uses his immersive audio design and crystal-sharp visual-effects splendor to convey Oppenheimer’s emotional anxiety. The real struggle, which Nolan interlaces with Oppenheimer’s 1920s-1940s narrative, is the 1959 Congressional hearings for Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a political operative nonpareil who envies, admires, and resents the heady brilliance of the people with whom he surrounds himself. Strauss is up for Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower’s cabinet, and the hearings hinge on the scientific community’s estimation of his character. The conservative and pro-nukes Strauss knows that the liberal peacenik-convert Oppenheimer would never support him, which is why he masterminded a tribunal to question Oppenheimer’s communist sympathies and loyalty to the United States. Destroying Oppenheimer’s credibility is the key to Strauss’s political survival. Nolan toggles between the tense, heady days of the Manhattan Project, the 1954 tribunal, and the 1959 Congressional hearings, braiding the three events in ways that illuminate each other as much as they do elevate the anguish that all the characters endure and inflict in equal measure. Not one of them has impeccable scruples: despite their heady acumen, they are all very messy, very fallible people, who fall prey to petty slights, haughty snubs, unbridled arrogance and wounded pride. Oppenheimer, though hardly a saint, is the most sympathetic, if only because Nolan conveys his tortured world with such clarity. What makes Nolan’s film ultimately reverberate so intensely is the notion that such fundamentally emotional people created the world’s deadliest weapons. Another notion: of course they did. How human, the impulse to both create and destroy. “We’re all simple souls, I guess,” Oppenheimer murmurs at one point. More prescient was his famous remark before they pushed that big red button. “Lord, these affairs are hard on the heart.” Stephen Garrett is the former film editor of 'Time Out New York’ and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years. A Rotten Tomatoes certified reviewer, Garrett is also the founder of Jump Cut, a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent, foreign-language, and documentary films. Great review and great film. More needs to be written about how discussion of Nolan’s magnificent effort has been almost yolked in the middle brow MSM to the relatively trite – in an existential sense – film Barbie. I would love to hear what Nolan really thinks of this.
“Barbenheimmer” is indeed a thing and it deliberately(?) lessens the important impact Oppenheimer could have. No need to spook the horses. During our last Cold War in the 1980s and 1990s there used to be thousands in the streets protesting against the insanity of nuclear proliferation. According to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, these days we are the closest to nuclear war since the inception of their Doomsday Clock (See constant escalation of Ukraine war and the continued pushing of the envelope on Taiwan). It’s now 90 seconds to “midnight”  or the end of the Earth. The closest the Doomsday Clock has ever been set to armageddon. But… Hey! Look at this clip of Barbie’s face melting!"
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being discussed here wouldn't exist. ""It's a paradox, but it works."" This one brief sentence gets at the heart of the new Christopher Nolan film ""Oppenheimer,"" serving as a potentially accidental kind of mission statement. A movie about the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the Manhattan Project during the latter years of World War II and who essentially invented a new form of warfare via the atomic bomb, is not impossible but presents a series of challenges to any filmmaker. Here is a man whose intellect was unparalleled, who rubbed shoulders with many of the most remarkable scientists to ever live, and whose importance to both American and world history is unquestioned. But here is a man whose intellect led to the death of countless thousands of innocent people in service of concluding a world war, and whose intellect then inspired other people across the world to pursue more violent means of warfare.  The paradox of ""Oppenheimer"" is that the man deserves a full accounting, but that full accounting does not flatter him or those around him; that the three-hour epic is populated by what feels like three-quarters of Hollywood with many actors appearing just for a handful of minutes; that in many ways, the film is centered around the Trinity Test, in which the atomic bomb was first successfully tested in the deserts of New Mexico, but is otherwise an intimate story in which different groups of men debate things in different locations, all presented in crystal-clear IMAX photography. But, to quote Oppenheimer, it works.  In spite of the fact that Nolan (serving also as sole screenwriter, working off the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography ""American Prometheus"") is dealing with only real-life characters and events for the first time in his career, he still manages to fiddle around with timelines, helping ensure that ""Oppenheimer"" is never less than propulsive, intellectual, and jittery in its pacing. There are two separate title cards (for the scientific properties of fission and fusion) that appear early in the film, meant to delineate one thread in which Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is brought before a faux-prosecutorial board of men curious to revoke his security clearances in 1954, and another in which politician Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) goes through a contentious Cabinet confirmation process in 1959. But there's a third, slightly more straightforward thread throughout, in which we follow Oppenheimer for nearly two decades, from his college days at Cambridge leading up to the fateful morning in mid-July 1945 when the A-bomb was tested in the dark of night. Headline aside, it's not really a spoiler to talk about American history, especially history of such gravity. It's to Christopher Nolan's credit that he's able to treat a couple of different aspects of the post-WWII downfall of J. Robert Oppenheimer as surprises akin to something in a suspense thriller, both regarding someone in the shadows coming out to speak against a key figure in a public manner. The 1954 hearing against Oppenheimer — which resulted in him losing his security clearance, and helped contribute to his falling out of the public spotlight after being celebrated across America for years as ""the father of the atomic bomb"" — hinges on a letter written to J. Edgar Hoover by William Borden (David Dastmalchian, 15 years removed from his feature debut role in ""The Dark Knight"") that calls out Oppenheimer for his left-wing political leanings and his connections to more strident Communists among the scientific community and in his personal life.  For most of the three-hour running time, it's technically an open question for a Senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich) to wonder who in the Atomic Energy Commission gave Borden the classified material to help accuse Oppenheimer. The eventual revelation that Strauss worked with a sour military man (Dane DeHaan) to give Borden the files feels less surprising than perhaps expected, if only because of how effectively Downey, Jr. captures in his performance the frustration and moral impotence he feels between himself and Oppenheimer, a man who he admires but is humiliated by in countless situations. The twist that does work more effectively occurs in Strauss' Senate hearing, as he attempts to win a place in President Eisenhower's Cabinet as Secretary of Commerce. Much hinges on the testimony of a scientist named David Hill, who we see only very briefly and silently earlier in the film. But since Oscar winner Rami Malek plays Hill, it's no surprise that he has a crucial moment in offering his testimony at the hearing, quickly making clear that he's essentially representing any and all scientists horrified by how the American government treated Oppenheimer after World War II, and accurately accuses Strauss of having spearheaded the attempt to discredit the eponymous scientist.  For any criticisms levied against Christopher Nolan in his career about being too cold or calculated as a filmmaker, there's a strong and intense undercurrent of emotion bubbling under the surface throughout every scene. The sequences featuring Downey, Jr. (those filmed from his perspective, both during the Cabinet hearing and in any flashbacks emanating from his remarks, are in black-and-white, a first for IMAX photography) are rife with jealousy, as Strauss desperately tries to be accepted by a scientific community that instantly understands his mental limitations and treats him as second-rate. Of the many recurrent images in the film, one that stands out and serves as the kicker for the story is that of Strauss watching from afar as Oppenheimer speaks with the legendary Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) on the Princeton campus, before Strauss tries and fails to make polite conversation with Einstein, leading the politician to assume the two scientists were speaking derisively about him. And Oppenheimer himself is both charismatic and tightly wound; from the start, when we see him as a young man, it seems clear that for all his remarkable intelligence, this is a man barely holding himself together and frequently coming apart at the seams.  When we think of films shot in IMAX — not just the ones presented on the towering screens — we think of action spectacles, such as Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" or Tom Cruise scaling the Burj Khalifa in ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol."" But ""Oppenheimer,"" though it does feature some jaw-dropping imagery meant to depict the visions of quantum mechanics and physics rattling around Oppenheimer's psyche (he dubs it being plagued by visions) before leading up to the Trinity Test, is largely focused on the man himself, both emotionally and literally. Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot this in a mix of IMAX and 65mm film (and if you are lucky enough to live near one of the 30-plus theaters in the United States presenting the film in IMAX and 70mm, you must run to get tickets if you haven't already procured them), and so much of what's presented are close-ups of actors' faces.  As much as Christopher Nolan is known for his ability to conjure up spectacle (like one of the magicians from his adaptation of ""The Prestige""), he's an excellent director of actors, and the proof is in the six-story images littered throughout ""Oppenheimer."" Murphy, whose collaborations with Nolan extend to ""Batman Begins"" when he played the Scarecrow, is the obvious standout, doing so much with a man who managed to be both charming enough to win over the might of the American military and government as well as scientists across the world, while also repressing the very real guilt and trauma he felt at inflicting death and destruction upon society. The use of close-ups on Nolan's part, and the tautly expressive emotions running rampant on Murphy's face recall the silent-film masterpiece ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" in which Renee Jeanne Falconetti delivered a masterful performance for the ages through her pained visage. ""Oppenheimer"" is not a silent film, and Nolan gives his leading man plenty of dialogue to work through, but it's in Murphy's cutting blue eyes and his tightly wound face that so much emotion bleeds through.  With a cast also including (deep breath) Emily Blunt, Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Malek, Matthew Modine, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Ehrenreich, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, and Casey Affleck (and many, many more), ""Oppenheimer"" is as impressively acted beyond the title role, with all actors making such powerful impacts that it's almost unfortunate how so many of them only make brief appearances. But that's the nature of the time-jumping, globe-trotting story.  Of course, the central moment of ""Oppenheimer,"" its true climax, is the depiction of the Trinity Test. Again, since history is history, it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the test works, because the A-bomb would quickly be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, swiftly bringing an end to World War II in August 1945. Much of the hour or so preceding the test has touches and inspirations from Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood,"" as Oppenheimer re-embraces his scientist status after briefly donning a military uniform, setting up an old-fashioned town in the middle of Los Alamos, New Mexico, and all in the hopes of effectively creating an atomic bomb that brings together his theories of quantum physics. The nighttime sequence building up to the Trinity Test, with Oppenheimer nervy and edgy as the rest of the scientists as well as his military keeper (Damon), is remarkably tense in spite of the fact that (as noted above) the test clearly works. Perhaps part of the tension derives from the knowledge many viewers have: that Christopher Nolan, priding himself on eschewing CGI when possible, has stated that his film's replication of the Trinity explosion was accomplished with practical effects. And though ""Oppenheimer"" is not an action film, Nolan is one of the finest filmmakers working today who can effectively and clearly create awesome and terrifying action-based imagery. The Trinity Test is no exception; he, van Hoytema, editor Jennifer Lame, and the entire production team have pulled off something here both weirdly beautiful and definitively horrific. That the test works is a validation of Oppenheimer's theories, and of his scientists' man-hours of work over multiple years and multiple billions of dollars. But it also represents — as noted to Oppenheimer by Niels Bohr (Branagh) — a new world, not just a new weapon. Oppenheimer, as intelligent as he is, is also hopelessly idealistic, presuming that by using the A-bomb, America would not only show off its power to the world, but ensure a longer world peace because of it. So when he approaches President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) to share the concern that he has blood on his hands, he's gobsmacked by Truman noting (harshly but in some way correctly) that the Japanese care less about the man who made the bomb than the man (and thus, the country) dropping the bomb.  The ensuing horror Oppenheimer feels (along with the twin revelations of how William Borden got his hands on classified materials, and how Lewis Strauss will fail to get a Cabinet post) culminates in the film's final scene. As Nolan hops around in time throughout the swift three hours of ""Oppenheimer,"" he keeps coming back to the image in Strauss' mind of how Einstein seemingly snubbed him after a brief conversation with our title character. But as Ehrenreich's Senate aide notes, it's always possible that they weren't talking about Strauss at all but ""something more important."" And aside from being a snide dig, we learn in the end that the aide is right. In the final scene, we get the objective truth of what happened in that side discussion, as Oppenheimer reminisces with Einstein about how the latter reviewed the former's calculations of what would lead to the A-bomb. Einstein noted in that earlier conversation that Oppenheimer could end up destroying the world if he wasn't careful, referencing a possibility that a single A-bomb explosion would lead to a catastrophic chain reaction of never-ending detonation and the world going up in smoke in an instant. Literally, that never happened. But metaphorically, ""I believe we did,"" Oppenheimer intones quietly. As devastating as ""Oppenheimer"" is, and as much as the final moments of the film visualize the terror in the man's mind at the notion of having destroyed the world (recalling the line from the Bhagavad Gita, ""I am become Death, destroyer of worlds"" that Oppenheimer used to refer to himself in real life), it avoids being overly didactic or polemical. There's little doubt that Nolan is not treating this man as a savior — perhaps the most disturbing scene of the film comes after the Trinity Test, as Oppenheimer gives a speech meant to rouse a crowd cheering on the end of WWII due to the A-bomb (thus cheering on the death of thousands), but envisions the crowd engulfed by the same bomb, with charred bodies and flapping skin — but he's treating the man with depth and honesty. Christopher Nolan has made variations on the themes inherent in ""Oppenheimer"" before, from men rent asunder by warring internal motivations to the horrendous and awe-inspiring power the human mind can wield. But this film feels like an apotheosis for so much of the career leading up to this moment. As befitting its ideal presentation, this is a big, mammoth movie, boasting a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy, a whip-smart script, and other technical marvels. (Jennifer Lame's editing is particularly remarkable, ensuring smooth transitions from timeline to timeline, and sometimes from aspect ratio to aspect ratio.) ""Oppenheimer"" arrived with huge expectations, and has turned out to be a glimpse into American history that speaks with gravity and weight. This is one of the best films of the year."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," Director Christopher Nolan’s biopic on Robert J Oppenheimer, credited as the ‘father of the atom bomb’, is an explosive look into the troubled genius’ mind. It’s a cinematic incendiary of our times powered by some brilliant acting and a compelling storyline. The movie, spearheaded by an on-point Cillian Murphy in the titular role, hits you like a sledgehammer as it raises questions on the moral/ethical dilemma faced by the remarkable theoretical physicist after he was tasked with developing nuclear weapons to alter the course of World War II. Robert J Oppenheimer, a bundle of complex contradictions, altered the geopolitical landscape and changed the course of World War II after he built nuclear weapons at Americans' disposal, and Nolan delves deep into his sharp-yet-muddled psyche with the precision of a surgical knife. And the film works wonderfully because of the collective acting prowess of the star-studded ensemble. Whether it’s Robert Downey Jr playing Lewis Strauss, the former chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, with great impact or Emily Blunt playing Oppenheimer’s wife dealing with alcoholism and her husband’s regular transgressions, this film is a masterclass in subtle acting. Every actor pulls their heft with aplomb. The movie, which opens with Oppenheimer’s murky college episode at Cambridge University in which he almost poisons his professor by injecting potassium cyanide into a green apple and later battling suspicions of being a Soviet spy, gives us a dense understanding of this brilliantly fractured person. And fortunately, it’s not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This film is one of Nolan’s best and searingly simple-yet-complicated works. The dichotomy between a scientific genius’ love for discovery and his fears on how his inventions will be used to destroy innocent lives has been wonderfully illustrated. Every character in this film isn’t painted with broad black and white strokes, they revel in the grey. Murphy’s conflicts and struggles are languidly brought out in the 180-minute epic spectacle. The superhero, although broken, is clearly this actor in this epic spectacle. The film oscillates between a riveting crime procedural – where Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project – is witch-hunted in the US in the early 1950s and an extraordinary story of the rise and fall of a celebrated scientist. While the heavy-lifting is done by a rich ensemble of male actors (here’s looking at you Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck and Rami Malek), the women in this biopic are equally potent. Blunt as Murphy’s wife, a high-functioning alcoholic overwhelmed by her own infant – and Florence Pugh – who plays Oppenheimer’s volatile girlfriend-turned-mistress – make a significant impact. Watch out for the confrontation scenes between the husband and wife and husband and mistress that are heaving with pathos. This well-made feature doesn’t pass judgment on any of its characters and doesn’t pass that burden to its viewers either. Visually, the film is arresting and reaches a crescendo when Murphy and his team of sharp scientists oversee the detonation of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. The momentous and grim event was the perfect build-up and made sure that ‘Oppenheimer’ closed with a bang."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," History isn’t always a subject for big ticket tentpole movies, and even when directors more familiar with explosions than textbooks try to engage such subject matter, the results can be rather shaky. At the same time, a writer/director like Christopher Nolan can truly make crucial moments in the fabric of our society come to life in such a manner that factual events can become something dazzling (and also frightening) to behold. The man did it before with his work on Dunkirk, and now with Oppenheimer Nolan has used the father of the atomic bomb to deliver an epic biopic that masterfully walks the line between entertaining spectacle and chilling historical reverence. Oppenheimer uses a very similar structure to Dunkirk, in that it tells a handful of different stories across time. One half details the academic and professional life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), as he speeds towards the creation of the atomic bomb. On the other half of the story is Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a man who’s slogging through a senate confirmation hearing in the aftermath of The Manhattan Project. These stories weave in and out of each other’s orbit, shifting between color and black and white respectively, with Oppenheimer being the common thread. As Christopher Nolan has proven time and again, non-linear storylines are of more interest to him than a straightforward narrative. And once again, the usage of such a narrative twist helps bring Oppenheimer to life in brilliant detail. Combining scientific and historical fact with his unique narrative flare, Nolan takes what could have been a flat, by the numbers historical drama and makes it an engaging epic. In a summer of blockbusters, the Tenet director has chosen to drop a metaphorical bomb on the competition, through a movie that feels more suited for awards season. But thanks to the consistently engrossing way that Oppenheimer engages its subject matter, the dawn of the atomic age kind of plays like an atypical blockbuster itself. There’s even a moment where Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer dons his iconic look, pipe and all, that feels similar to a superhero first gearing up in a film like Batman Begins. That observation isn’t meant to color Christopher Nolan’s picture as a superficial affair. Inspired by authors Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, this is very much a firm examination of Oppenheimer’s life and times. But instead of just showing Cillian Murphy’s journey from start to finish in traditional fashion, The Dark Knight director jumps between the pre and post atomic era time periods, showing both halves on a collision course with history. Infusing those happenings with momentum and style from the start, you feel like you're living history rather than just witnessing it.  The world knew that Oppenheimer was going to be a star studded affair, as the cast announced throughout the pre-release promotional blitz became too large to ignore. Upon actually seeing the movie, it’s even more pleasing to realize that that roster, including such heavy hitters as Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon, is even more impressive than you’d think. All of it is anchored by a tremendous performance by Cillian Murphy, who locks in this formula of amazing talent with such gravitas that it never feels like “stunt casting.” Everyone in Oppenheimer’s stacked deck gets their “moment,” so if you see a familiar face with no lines in Act I, be patient. Lending to the paranoia that ensues throughout the film’s story, the audience never quite knows what to expect from even the most recognizable performers hidden within. But again, it’s Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer that holds court, front and center, from start to finish. While that’s a foregone conclusion, as he is after all playing the titular historical figure, this longtime member of the Christopher Nolan Repertory Company doesn’t play the part as such. Cillian Murphy sees all the facets of Oppenheimer, and is allowed to interact with each piece of his complicated protagonist properly.  There’s a great deal of respect for J. Robert Oppenheimer in this project, but Oppenheimer never seeks to merely cash in on the “troubled genius who saw the future” card. At times Robert is the life of the party and scientific genius of the day, and at other moments he’s a distant womanizer whose deeply troubled by the path he seems to be taking.  Further credit should be given to Robert Downey Jr., as his portrayal of Lewis Strauss is just as vital and compelling in the black and white narrative Oppenheimer uses as its counterbalance. It’s really hard to resist talking about the insanely phenomenal cast that’s been drafted by the Nolan machine this time out. But if there’s anyone else to single out when it comes to carrying the same narrative heft Murphy is lifting throughout, it’s Downey and his deliciously complex portrayal of a would-be politician who has to navigate his own association with Robert Oppenheimer in a very complex manner.  Historical and scientific dramas like Oppenheimer have built a reputation for being stuffy and flat, prone to being produced as awards bait films that get released towards the end of the year for such consideration. Though Christopher Nolan has been reported as superstitious about releasing his films in the same July timeframe, unleashing this captivating title in the middle of “blockbuster season” makes a lot of sense.  Oppenheimer isn’t merely trying to depict history, it also tries to get the audience to engage in its course. Following the invention of the atomic age, both in practice and in politics, Nolan and his cast are using existing history as a potent warning not to repeat it. With that aim, the iconic director joins the ranks of other films like Tetris that try to show the world the repercussions of pivot points future generations merely read about in textbooks. By treating history with a respectable level of event movie flare, the door is open for everyone to walk through and partake in stories that have previously seemed reserved to appeal directly to awards bodies and academics. In experiencing Oppenheimer, the audience is invited to live the horrors of this cultural shift as if they were alive when it first happened. That method is not only narratively pleasing, but it also can be seen as a call to empathy and attention towards the fears we’ve seen turned into blockbuster fodder in the decades that followed the destructive power that Los Alamos project made a reality.  A studious examination of history, shown via a reverent lens of Hollywood spectacle, Oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be Christopher Nolan’s best picture yet. Depicting an event that was both marvelous in potential, yet horrific in its execution,  it is ambiguous in how it morally examines its characters, while also being abundantly clear on how it stands on the matter of nuclear proliferation. It is nothing short of an epic cinematic triumph, and should be a movie heralded and dissected for decades to come.

"Aug 3, 2023",positive," As dense as a black hole, Oppenheimer condenses hundreds of pages from American Prometheus into a single film, filled with enough recognizable actors to populate a small town. Even at three hours, the drama doesn’t waste a moment, keeping the audience rapt for its entirety. Christopher Nolan’s adaptation narrows the scope of the doorstop biography and largely focuses on two periods in the wildly interesting life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” Yet those two periods are momentous enough to have shaped not only Oppenheimer, but also the broader world. The centerpiece is, unsurprisingly, the atomic bomb testing by the Oppenheimer-led Manhattan Project in 1945, but Nolan places equal weight on the 1954 hearing that found the physicist’s loyalty to the United States in question during the Red Scare. Nolan gives both events their due in this film that is both challenging and immensely entertaining. That seeming dissonance is one of many in Oppenheimer, especially as it depicts the man himself, played by Cillian Murphy. The key theme echoes quantum superposition, the principle that a particle can be in two places at the same time. Similarly, Nolan’s film posits that people can be two opposing things at once: Robert Oppenheimer is a genius who is naive to the workings of the world, a theoretical physicist whose signature discovery wreaks a massive physical impact on the world, and the creator of the nuclear bomb who only wants peace. No one here is purely good or evil, and Nolan’s film is neither a hagiography nor a condemnation of this controversial figure. Oppenheimer is decidedly anti-atomic bomb (in case you were wondering), but its take on its primary subject is more nuanced. Murphy is surrounded by literally dozens of recognizable actors; listing everyone whose face you know would consume my entire word count (and confound my editor). Most significant are Emily Blunt doing a crisp Mid-Atlantic accent as his wife, Kitty, also a study in contradictions; Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, the prickly chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission; and Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, the gruff general presiding over the Manhattan Project. But Oppenheimer has a deep bench, with special shout-outs deserved by Florence Pugh in a small role as Jean Tatlock, Robert’s troubled lover; David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, his friend and fellow scientist; and Alden Ehrenreich as a senate aide. Most characters get just a line or two, and keeping all of them straight is an intellectual feat roughly on level with grasping the basics of quantum physics.  In theory, Oppenheimer is the type of biographical drama that most people would feel fine waiting months to see on their TV at home. Yet even beyond the wide scope of his characters and story, Nolan challenges the idea of the traditional biopic, making it an immediate must-see on the big screen. The format — particularly in the ideal 70mm IMAX — showcases the massive scale of the bomb tests and magnifies quantum particles to the size of a tennis court. However, it also showcases these detailed performances, allowing the audience to see actors like Murphy practically under a microscope, showcasing every pore and even the smallest of facial expressions. Every scene somehow feels simultaneously epic and intimate at this size, whether it’s a pillar of fire or a conversation held around a conference table.  Oppenheimer is Nolan’s longest film, and in many ways, it’s his most ambitious. Though more structurally straightforward than Tenet, it refuses the traditional biopic route of telling Robert’s story in linear fashion. Instead, though it primarily focuses on his Manhattan Project years and his later security clearance struggles, it also offers glimpses of other key moments in his life as well as the senate confirmation hearing of Downey’s Strauss, bouncing between these times with speed and ease. Nolan shifts between black-and-white and color cinematography, changing film stock and aspect ratios frequently; the only constant is that it’s consistently gorgeous.  Select moments lack subtlety, and some of the metaphors are rendered a little too clearly. Yet Nolan requires so much of the audience with this epic drama that it’s a forgivable sin to occasionally make things a little easy on them. But as much as Nolan asks of the viewer, he provides equal rewards. What may be most remarkable in this film about the making of the atomic bomb is the humor woven throughout, as well as the warmth. Oppenheimer the man may not have always understood the people around him, but Oppenheimer the movie is full of humanity and real emotion.  Nolan rarely misses, and Oppenheimer is the director working at his best in a film with big explosions and even bigger ideas. This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling—and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it. "
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," From comic book blockbusters (The Dark Knight) to science fiction epics (Interstellar) to mind-bending thrillers (Inception) to small-scale noirs (Memento), Christopher Nolan has repeatedly proven himself adept at making genre films of all shapes and sizes. If Dunkirk, his 2017 film about the historic World War II battle, was his bid to prove that he’s a “serious filmmaker”, then Oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema. (I honestly don’t think Nolan suffers from an auteur inferiority complex and likely spends no time worrying about what film critics or his fellow filmmakers think about his filmography.) Nolan loves to tell a disjointed, stream-of-consciousness narrative, and Oppenheimer is no different. The film unfolds on multiple timelines: before the bomb, after the bomb and during the bureaucratic witch hunt that pursued Oppenheimer in the Commie-hunting paranoia of the 1950’s. The film is not a birth-to-death biopic. It’s a portrait of a pivotal historical figure who forever changed global politics by inventing the weapon to end all wars. The editing effortlessly cuts from past to present to future (though it may be uncertain which timeline is truly “the present”) creating a fever dream of a film that roils and explodes like the images we see filling Oppenheimer’s mind. The cinematography and production design give each time line its own look so the audience intuitively feels which section of the famed physicist’s life they’re witnessing simply from the visual characteristics of the footage. It’s a brilliant form of narrative shorthand that prevents the need for title cards with dates, locations and the like which are so often employed in historical films. It keeps the film from feeling choppy or episodic. The performances are uniformly excellent. Cillian Murphy is all inward intensity as The Father of the Atomic Bomb. Quieter performances don’t always register with audiences and critics, but Murphy’s work here is stunning. Robert Downey, Jr. reminds us all that he’s a great actor who’s been away playing a comic book icon for a decade. His portrayal of Admiral Lewis Strauss, a political mover and shaker who tries to advance his career at every turn, seems destined to dominate any Best Supporting Actor race even though saying so in July feels absurd. The smaller character contributions from Kenneth Branagh (Niels Bohr), Tom Conti (Albert Einstein), Josh Hartnett (Ernest Lawrence), Benny Safdie (Edward Teller) and dozens of others help create a rich narrative where everyone on screen feels like a living, breathing human being and not a “device” that’s somehow needed to move the story forward. Oddly for a Christopher Nolan film, the female characters are mostly objects of lust for the title character. Florence Pugh is an early lover who is cast aside but never leaves Oppenheimer’s thoughts. Emily Blunt plays his troubled, but loyal, wife who first comes into his orbit as a mistress. The Nolan universe is known for being largely “sexless”, and the director makes up for lost time, putting Oppenheimer firmly in R-rated territory. The timing of Oppenheimer is a bit of a head-scratcher. Summer at the theater usually means superheroes in capes, sequels galore and neon pink bubble gum pop films like Barbie. During this season of mindless entertainment, Nolan unleashes a three-hour, dialogue-driven epic about the best scientific minds in the world racing to solve a theoretical physics riddle and stop a war. Einstein, Oppenheimer and Niels Bohr uniting to contemplate the ramifications of a nuclear explosion doesn’t exactly scream Avengers Assemble! to the average moviegoer. However, for those of you out there waiting anxiously for the fall movie season when all of the awards darlings hit theaters, Oppenheimer will give you a smell of pumpkin spice in July, a cool breeze on a steamy summer morning, that lets you know fall isn’t too far away. It’ll become a very crowded field as films from Martin Scorsese (Killers of the Flower Moon), Ridley Scott (Napoleon) and Michael Mann (Ferrari) enter the awards fray. It feels appropriately meta that the first masterpiece of the fall awards season is about a genius who fired the biggest peremptory shot in the history of the world."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," In the stunning eighth episode of Twin Peaks: The Return, the series diverges from its main narrative to offer an extended scene of the first test of the atomic bomb at White Plains, NM in 1945. What follows is a kind of origin story for the Twin Peaks cosmos, culminating with scenes of demonic figures insinuating themselves into a picturesque desert town 11 years after the blast. As with all things Twin Peaks, and Lynch in general, what it all means is open for discussion, but it seems unlikely that tying a depictionn of how evil enters the world to the dawn of the atomic age is mere coincidence. Born a year after the test, Lynch was one of the first of a generation that knew no world except one that could end in flames at the push of a button.  Christopher Nolan’s films have little in common with Lynch’s work but Oppenheimer, Nolan’s biopic of “Father of the Atomic Bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, is pervaded with a similar sense of irreversibility, treating the Trinity test as a point of no return, an act once committed would forever change the world, and possibly set it up for destruction. Nolan’s films have long played with time, and Oppenheimer is no exception. But here, the flitting through the most eventful years of Oppenheimer’s life all feed into or empty out of that fixed moment, when the brilliant minds behind an extraordinary scientific project handed humanity a weapon of unthinkable power then lost control of what happened next. The Reveal is a reader-supported newsletter dedicated to bringing you great essays, reviews and conversation about movies. While both free and paid subscriptions are available, please consider a paid subscription to support our long-term sustainability. The film unfolds on two timelines, each anchored to a dramatic, and fraught, hearing. In one, shot in color and anchored in 1954, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) sits before a committee that will determine whether he’ll have to surrender his security clearance due to his previous (and already well-known) association with members of the Communist party. The second, shot in black-and-white, is built around the 1958 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dwight Eisenhower’s nominee for commerce secretary, and a man with whom Oppenheimer had a complex, ultimately adversarial relationship. Oppenheimer moves at a sometimes dizzying pace, jumping freely through time as it switches between its two narrative tracks. Nolan introduces dozens of characters across incidents that at first seem unrelated. Here’s Oppenheimer as a frustrated student. Here he is considering taking a Princeton job offered by Strauss in the years after World War II. It’s the sort of film that can only benefit from a second viewing; familiarity with Nolan’s primary source, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer; or, ideally, both. But as with Dunkirk, it’s also a film that teaches viewers how to watch it. Details cohere into patterns. Dots get connected. Characters first glimpsed in the background come into focus. And, always at the center even when he’s not on screen, is Oppenheimer. Long a Nolan favorite, Murphy gives Oppenheimer its center of gravity, and its sense of graveness. In the film’s earliest scenes—chronologically if not always in placement—he already looks like a man burdened with an incalculable weight, as if he already understood that the ideas and formulas swimming in his head would have global consequences. Alarmingly thin (Murphy has cited late-’70s David Bowie as a physical model), restrained in expression, and with a low, deliberate manner of speaking that’s reminiscent of Peter Weller’s William S. Burroughs in Naked Lunch, Murphy’s Oppenheimer is  an unnerving presence, but also a man of undeniable genius driven by a strong sense of what needs to be done at all times. That drive extends to his unwillingness to draw a line between his educational life and support for leftist causes that put him shoulder to shoulder with Communists, which sets the stage for his later troubles. The intense focus, and Murphy’s exceptional work, make Oppenheimer work equally well as a study of a remarkably complex character whose greatest accomplishment would become his greatest (but hardly only) source of torment and as the story of that character’s journey through one the most transformative events in human history. Nolan makes Oppenheimer both biography and thriller. The nervy filmmaking and Ludwig Göransson’s intense score combine in an atmosphere of unrelenting dread. That’s, perhaps expectedly, true in scenes of Oppenheimer and an all-star band of mid-century scientific minds (played by, among many others, Michael Angarano, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Jack Quaid, Rami Malek, and Olivia Thirlby). But it’s employed just as effectively when the film navigates his sometimes-relationships with the women in his life, particularly psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), a woman whose supportiveness of her husband could never be mistaken for weakness, in part because it seems to be stretched to its limit at every moment. The rise of IP as a near-prerequisite for risk-averse studios has put directors of ambition in a compromising position: How do you express a personal vision within the constraints of fan (and brand) expectation? That’s a particularly vexing proposition for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which has to build a narrative around a doll that’s had such a seismic impact on the culture and the way little girls understand womanhood that the obligatory hat-tips and payoffs are not enough. There are landmines to sidestep, too. Can you advance feminism while boosting a toy corporation? How much can you question the mythos of a doll that’s had a mixed track record, at best, in reinforcing standards of beauty and achievement? And even if you manage to thread this exceedingly thin needle, can you still show the audience a good, bubbly time at the movies?  Gerwig endeavors to try, with the understanding that perfection is unattainable. Her Barbie cannot be all things to all people, and it cannot wriggle away from the contradictions that ensnare it. It's a heroic effort nonetheless, a bright and funny and ever-so-close-to-subversive bauble that’s willing to take chances and assert itself in the largest possible cultural arena. And that squares with its idea of womanhood as an impossible undertaking that requires a certain guile to pull off if you want to dictate the terms. “Strong” women have been a dull, obligatory component of blockbusters for years, second only to gender-reversal in their lack of imagination. Gerwig goes for “complicated,” and makes a satisfying mess of things.  The opening third is The Truman Show with double the artifice, as a Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), who exists in a utopian Barbieland, lives harmoniously in her Dream House along with a vast product line of other Barbies and Kens, though one Ken, played by Ryan Gosling, is particularly attached to her. Barbie’s perfect days in this matriarchal society—Ken’s role here is simply “Beach”—are disrupted first by minor hiccups, like “flat feet” and a cold fake shower, but thoughts of death and other melancholy issues throw her into an existential crisis. That leads the one misfit in town, “Weird Barbie” (Kate McKinnon), to suggest Barbie visit the real world, where she can track down the person who’s been playing with her and figure out why she’s made her so sad. With Ken in tow, Barbie discovers the gulf between Barbieland and the real world is larger than she ever imagined while Ken thrills to the possibilities of importing the patriarchy. Meanwhile, the all-male executive team at Mattel, led by Will Farrell, labors to contain the situation.  Gerwig has conceptualized Barbieland as a retina-piercing, day-glo paradise where actions are imaginary and routines are paramount, with a harmony made possible by perfection. The sci-fi absurdity of these plastic, genital-free dolls toggling through their accessories shifts to fish-out-of-water comedy when Barbie and Ken skate through Santa Barbara on rollerblades, and face a topsy-turvy world where Barbie doesn’t seem to have had much impact at all. Gerwig and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach, are a bit saddled by the fact that Barbie is reeling with melancholy while Ken gets to have all the fun, with Gosling merrily indulging Ken’s love for a place where his cocksure stupidity and love of horses are richly rewarded. I wasn’t as enamored of Oppenheimer as Keith is -- and I did see it in 70mm IMAX, which means it was under the best possible circumstances -- largely because I felt the Strauss confirmation hearing was probably one layer too many.  Last night I watched Roland Joffé’s Fat Man and Little Boy to see how it treated the same story. As expected, it’s much more linear, and even provides the viewer with multiple scenes of Oppenheimer being actively involved in the science behind the development of the bomb. In Nolan’s film, we’re expected to take it on faith that he’s so brilliant because he knows so many other brilliant scientists (Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, etc.) and everyone else keeps mentioning how brilliant he is.  Reading about the fluid time-jumping of Oppenheimer reminds me of the finest chapter in the Watchmen graphic novel, the one with Dr. Manhattan on Mars.  I can't even remember if that chapter is depicted at all in the awful movie...sounds like Nolan does a better job here, thankfully."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," The word “operatic” comes to mind when describing Christopher Nolan’s maddening, flawed, sometimes-brilliant “Oppenheimer.” It’s his boldest, most dense film and one that might come into clearer focus on subsequent viewings.  Even at three hours, the amount of story that Nolan packs into this film feels like it’s not enough to convey everything that he has to say. “Oppenheimer” closely resembles “Dunkirk” in the way it manages to weave countless storyline structures into this magnificent whole.  Of course, telling the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer, a man who poured blood, sweat and tears into becoming “the father of the atomic bomb” is a complicated one. The film wouldn’t have worked as well without the constantly brilliant editing techniques of Jennifer Lame, who absolutely deserves all of the accolades she is likely going to be getting for her work here.  Formally and conceptually, “Oppenheimer” is a staggering achievement as it zeroes on a clandestine weapons lab that was formed in the Los Alamos desert during the thick of WWII. This is Nolan’s most complex work and it has plenty of substance to boot, maybe too much. Robert Oppenheimer, powerfully played here by Cillian Murphy, was a man tasked by the U.S. government to build the bomb, but the Nazis had a 12-month head start on him. It was the beginning of the arms race, one that would inevitably continue against Russia. In trying to beat the Nazis, Oppenheimer chose a crackling team of the world’s best scientists, many of them Jewish refugees from Germany, to build a weapon whose ramifications are still being felt to this day. It quite literally changed the world order. In the film, Nolan goes back and forth between Oppenheimer’s early beginnings, as a theoretic physics student in 1920s Germany, to his Los Alamos testing site and, inevitably, to his shunning as a communist during the rage of the ‘50s Mccarthy witch-hunts. Politician Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a conniving individual who gladly threw Oppenheimer under the bus to further his career, sleazily instigated the scientist’s security clearance hearing in 1954. Downey Jr, looking gaunt, and older, is given chewy lines of dialogue, all shot in black and white sequences, and he’s impeccably cast as the villain of the piece.  There’s also Oppenheimer’s affair with an American communist named Jean Tatlock (scene stealing Florence Pugh) — it eventually ends, hampered by her unwillingness to commit. He later weds alcoholic Kitty Harrison (an underused Emily Blunt), whose role is underwritten. Pugh, nude practically the entire time, is a wonderfully haunting presence, a fragile figure with a tragic fate.  The number of characters in this film are aplenty, all played by notably well-known actors: There’s physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Matt Damon as the General overseeing the Los Alamos project, Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), a physicist who invented a particle accelerator, and Gary Oldman as President Truman. Benny Safdie even shows up as the thickly-accented Edward Teller, the theoretical physicist known as the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” and recent Oscar-winner Rami Malek, underused, is basically given just one scene. Here’s the thing about “Oppenheimer:” when it works, it soars. Some of the scenes conveyed here by Nolan and Lame, aided by composer Ludwig Göransson‘s sizzling score, feel transcendent. However, the point of “Oppenheimer” is for it to have a cumulative and powerful effect on the viewer once the 3-hour runtime ends. Can any other filmmaker in Hollywood work on this grand of a scale and get away with it? Maybe Martin Scorsese, but that’s about it. It helps that Nolan is aided by the talented cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, who shot the movie in 65-millimeter film. Sometimes van Hoytema’s luscious photography overshadows the chaotic storytelling to the point where you’re sucked in by the images and lose track of the story. The film is filled with an innumerable amount of close-ups — in fact, most of the story is told via close-ups. If Nolan’s goal was to set the viewer inside Oppenheimer’s head, then mission accomplished. You can’t escape Murphy’s haunted blue eyes and it’s a towering performance from the Irish actor. There’s also a substantial number of scenes that feel damn-near visceral. Consider the one where Oppenheimer speaks to a crowd of patriotic Americans, post-Hiroshima bombing, their applause drowning out into mute. Panic sneaks into his head, the sound design starts roaring trembling sounds, the camera shakes, Oppenheimer continues talking, but it’s all reverberating echo. This is where he realizes the magnitude of what’s he’s done, and that he has the blood of innocent Japanese citizens in his hands. The trinity explosion has been spoken about plenty of times as well. Nolan didn’t use CGI, and the feeling you’re left with is like being there, at the first historic test of the bomb, as a literal light show occurs and a feeling of relief (and dread) seeps into the characters.  Nolan is absolutely obsessed with the subject at hand, maybe a little too obsessed in getting every detail of his story jammed into the film. And yet, it still feels as though “Oppenheimer” might be missing key moments that should have been added into its epic three hours."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," Oppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between the singularly original writer-director Christopher Nolan and the Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who, given the leading role here, works diligently under the guise of the physicist who created the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Populated with lightning-fast dialogues, oppressive music and artificial tension, the film differs from Nolan’s previous moves as there’s no emphasis on action. In a way, the type of narrative adopted by Nolan curbs the inventiveness that made Memento, Inception and Dunkirk instant classics. As a cerebral biopic, it tries to get our attention through scientific fascination, political repression, international espionage, and the moral dilemma faced by the title character, who struggles with his own creation: a massive weapon that poses an existential threat to the humankind. Oppenheimer’s guilt is well expressed, as well as the cynicism of some of his associates, like Dr. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr. is excellent) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Even president Truman (Gary Oldman) disregarded his torment and did nothing to prevent his political persecution.  It’s an interesting, if formal, film that manages to captivate intermittently. Shot statically in black-and-white and color, it follows a transparent narrative strategy, being structured as a series of slow-moving scenes that require you to dive into meticulous dialogue with tenacity. On one side it’s an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter, but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments. It all came up more informative than fun."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive,"In a year that has given us several great films, this one shines above the rest and is the strongest contender for the Oscar so far in 2023."
"Aug 3, 2023",positive," As a young man with visions of a hidden universe, J Robert Oppenheimer lays in his Cambridge university dorm, beset by an inability to rest. He’s instantly portrayed as brilliant, yet carries with him a darkness. His mind may be unmatched, but his humanity screams louder than any theory he could present. At times he is cruel, other times cold and unfeeling, and then overwhelmingly ridden with guilt. The most important man who ever lived, creating a weapon without an equal.  ‘Oppenheimer’ takes such a complicated figure and fastens you in to his unique perspective. As you watch the development of the atomic bomb, you’re infinitely intrigued by its herald. Cillian Murphy’s performance of the legendary scientist is multifaceted, seeming vulnerable and exposed in one frame, yet operatic and enigmatic in the next. The invention itself has a devastating effect, but the film’s warning goes beyond the terror of dropped of the bomb. The sequence in which the bomb is first tested is nothing short of an audio-visual marvel, but the true danger of the film lies in the protagonist’s presence. As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat. His followers express their qualms, but with one impassioned speech he rallys the troops towards a terrible victory. Despite this statement on statesmen, ‘Oppenheimer’ is non committal in its portrayal of its subject. As much as it delves into the psyche of its titular character, it makes very little stride in a definitive conclusion on his character. ‘Oppenheimer’ will leave you with more information than you may have had about the father of the atomic bomb, but undoubtedly create several questions as well. The film leaves you to pass your judgement on the man himself, his actions, and his feelings towards them when all is said and done.  Note: While I appreciate you reading this review, movies are still incredibly subjective. If you think you might enjoy yourself, I encourage everyone to support the cinema industry as much as they can. Stay safe, and remember, life’s too short for bad movies.  The sound quality of this film is horrendous. The subject is weighty, and the film is fairly dramatic. Too bad it so lacks much context of the McCarthy era’s red scare.
It would have been nice if (and people I know) had been able to hear all the words rather than 80% of them."
"Aug 2, 2023",negative," 
Inside the MJR digital theater at Partridge Creek in suburban Detroit last week, part of the audience behind me reacted with sudden cackles and extended giggles.
 
I had noticed them entering the afternoon matinee, a group of girls, ages probably from 8 through 14, many of them dressed at least in part in pink, as were some of their chaperones, who may have been their mothers, their grandmothers, or their aunts.
 
Perhaps some of the laughing kids weren’t even aware of all the functions of the genitalia mentioned by Barbie, played by Margo Robbie. That didn’t matter. Even at the potty-joke level, some humor crosses multiple demographics.
 
Because of that, viewing of this controversial PG-13 film should be limited only to people who are men, women, boys, girls, gay, straight, liberals, conservatives, white, Black, brown, red, and yellow, and also to those who really like the color pink.
 
Along with Oppenheimer — an over-hyped film that is interesting but not as good — Barbie marks the Summer of 2023 as a “Barbenheimer” moment coinciding with a confluence of cultural undercurrents.
 
For one thing, these two movies arrived during the first summer since 2019 in which it feels reasonably safe from the COVID-19 pandemic for people of all ages to return to indoor movie theaters among unmasked strangers. This helps build buzz.
 
Secondly, these movies came during a summer of show-business labor unrest, with two Hollywood unions (actors and writers) striking simultaneously for the first time in 60 years. At the London premier of Oppenheimer, its actors walked out in support of the strikers.
 
Third, both Barbie and Oppenheimer challenge their audiences to think seriously and critically about important issues like toxic masculinity and weapons that might destroy life on Earth. Barbie is a serious comedy, a satire. Oppenheimer is just deadly serious.
 
The humor in Barbie is wry, sly, sometimes over-the-top, gender-bending and hit-or-miss. If you don’t like one gag, stick around, another is on the way.
 
Bits of Barbie are animated like a kids’ cartoon. Some scenes suggest The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and Pee-Wee’s Playhouse. It opens with a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a Stanley Kubrick film from 1968.
 
Some of the in-jokes, double-entendres, and glib references fly by so fast it will take several viewings to comprehend them all. That alone could make Barbie a cult classic.
 
Furthermore, right-wing politicians and preachers are condemning Barbie for its ironic support of feminism and its LGBTQ+ attitude toward sexual stereotypes. In that these folks can’t take a joke, you know there is something good here.
 
Like the United Auto Workers and other unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America hope to catch up to the economic disruptions from the pandemic, when people sat at home and paid for streaming entertainment on big, clear, screens.
 
His Oppenheimer is an important historical biography with many memorable moments about J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who helped create the atomic bomb in 1945 in World War II. He is portrayed, well, by Cillian Murphy.
 
There is a countdown. There is a big, red button. Gradually, sight and sound gimmicks build the tension and enhance the dramatic impact. From the theater chair next to me, I heard a woman stifle a sob.
 
But after this climax comes another hour of story about how poorly Oppenheimer was treated by politicians not convinced of his loyalty. After the pinnacle moment of the Big Bang, it’s an awfully long epilogue.
 
His demise is presented more effectively in the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, upon which this film is based. It fleshes out Oppenheimer’s youth and family background to try to explain his peculiar intelligence.
 
Some of Oppenheimer is filmed in black-and-white, adding another layer of gray to the picture’s mood. Among a stellar cast, Matt Damon steals a couple scenes as a gruff general ostensibly supervising Oppenheimer.
 
The screen frequently shows Oppenheimer smoking, his lit cigarette burning like a fuse on a bomb — or on his career. Or, perhaps, he’s just blowing smoke. In addition, we see a jumbled timeline of flashback sequences that worked much better long ago in Citizen Kane.
 
There is also an IMAX version of Oppenheimer, which might further overdo the already overdone special effects. Unintentionally funny are three scenes in which the physicist Albert Einstein suddenly appears as if he is Shoeless Joe strolling out from the cornfields.
 
As for the Senior Citizen experience of returning to a crowded movie theater in the “Barbenheimer” summer of ’23, I saw both films on weekdays in a building with 14 screens. Large, leather reclining chairs offered lots of legroom.
 
At the theater bar (new to me) in the early afternoon, I could have purchased a “Long Island Ice Tea Premium” for $16.25 or a Bloody Mary for only $12.25. Instead, I paid just $6.25 for a large Diet Pepsi at the popcorn stand.
 
I put it in the generous cup holder on my comfy chair and elevated the electronic leg rest. (I’d used such things before the pandemic.) But I also accidentally touched the switch that turned on the three-level seat heater (who knew?) in the middle of summer.
 
It took a minute to turn it off. No jokes here, please, about a critic on the hot seat or any tasteless wisecracks about how one movie is “da bomb” while the other is “a bomb.” Or about how some Boomers just don’t know which button to push.

"Aug 2, 2023",neutral,"  Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a massive pot roast of a movie, sliced into edible bits. Most of it is top-shelf craftsmanship, except for the back-and-forth structure. Certainly a sharper brain than mine could tell you why the film hops timelines, or goes from color to black and white. When Oliver Stone did this sort of thing in JFK, it was to convey as much information as concisely as possible (given the three-hour running time); there were so many moving parts, so many talking heads, that Stone’s illustrative, almost free-associative approach felt necessary. Here there are only talking heads and, from what we’re given here, a simple story: Once there was a very smart man who did a very bad thing, and ironically was raked over the coals for stuff he didn’t even do. Meanwhile, even more ironically, he gets medals and handshakes for the bad thing. The end.  There’s one element worthy of unreserved praise here, and that’s Robert Downey Jr.’s welcome-home performance — his comeback, if you will, from his comeback, which kidnapped him into Marvel movies for eleven years — as Admiral Lewis Strauss, the man who got J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) stripped of his security clearance on the grounds that Oppenheimer had Communist leanings. History views Strauss unkindly, but Downey makes him a smart man with understandable sore spots; he imbues Strauss with wit but not an ounce of the smug hipness that characterized, say, Tony Stark or some of his other roles. For me, the movie changed from Oppenheimer to Strauss whenever Downey showed up, his upper lip drawn down in umbrage. Downey and Nolan must have understood that a cardboard anti-commie villain wouldn’t do.  As for Cillian Murphy, I’d like to say that he shoulders this whole ungainly thing and holds it all together, but aside from an accent that sounds at times eerily like Robin Williams in serious mode, Murphy’s Oppenheimer seems purposely blank. It’s nothing that Murphy does or doesn’t do. It’s that this Oppenheimer has been hollowed out. We empathize with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean (Florence Pugh), who are always chastising him for one thing or another. Oppenheimer is reduced to visual iconography — the straight-brim fedora, the dark suits, the cigarette or pipe. Early on, we see Oppenheimer spike a contemptuous professor’s apple with cyanide (the plot is a failure). He mentions it later on, but if any linkage is intended to his complicity in developing the ultimate death-dealer, it’s certainly kept quiet. Murphy recedes into himself, enacting the self-abasing emotions of a martyr, and the movie slips from his fingers into the robust hands of Downey, or Blunt or Pugh or Matt Damon.  Anyway, Oppenheimer delivers the bomb. It becomes urgent to get the bomb before the Nazis do — an army that carries the bomb before it is invincible, as old Marcus Brody might say. “Does it work?” is an existential question, since one of the possible events if it doesn’t work properly is, oh nothing bad, just the annihilation of the planet. But it works, and thereafter Hiroshima and Nagasaki are knocked off the board. “Compartmentalize,” goes a refrain from Damon’s General Groves, and Oppenheimer has to keep his science and his morals in different boxes. As Tom Lehrer sang of Wernher von Braun’s ethos, “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That’s not my department.” That verse speaks more mordantly, and God knows more concisely, about the paradox of Oppenheimer than this whole solidly built but pompously designed edifice does. Does Oppenheimer care where they come down? (Does Nolan?) He says he does, but does he really care about anything other than physics, his passion for which is also given short shrift? Given the two icons in this summer’s Barbenheimer event, I know which one seems more plastic and less human."
"Aug 2, 2023",positive," So begins Oppenheimer, the tale of fission and fusion. The first sentence of the quotation above, which opens the film, is the story of Oppenheimer and fission, the act of dividing or splitting something into two or more parts. The second sentence, which will be represented by Lewis Strauss (pronounced “straws”) is about the fusion that would torture Oppenheimer, mostly after the bomb, the result of the process of joining two or more things together to form a single entity. Oppenheimer was a master of compartmentalization, splitting his life into many parts and managing to control them all. But with his decision to lead Los Alamos, the process he took on required the joining of many things together, most particularly Science and The Government.  I’ve seen the film 5 times now (in 4 formats) and I still don’t feel properly prepared to write about the work as it deserves… 10,000 words at minimum. Without the freedom to take deep notes - which I wasn’t going to do in full theaters - and really, the ability to work through the maze of the film with the ability to stop and process at times, it’s too much.  But I will do my best to offer some broad strokes. I don’t know if this really qualifies as a review, so much as a discussion of the work. I wouldn’t read further without having seen the film.  The color vs black & white thing has nothing at all to do with time. Oppenheimer’s perspective is in color. Strauss’ perspective is in black and white. I have confirmed that much in these 5 viewings. A few scenes cross over and are repeated from each perspective, most notably the scenes with Einstein. Oppenheimer is not in every color scene, but at least his imagination is the driving perspective in every one. Strauss was never in the various schools or Los Alamos, so there is no black & white in any of those segments, for instance.  Oppenheimer is Prometheus and Strauss is there to try to tie him to the rock for his perceived arrogance. But really, it is Oppenheimer’s own fears of what he has empowered that tortures him for the rest of his life.  It has struck me more and more, with each screening, how this film’s science vs government arguments are very reflective of what I would assume to be Nolan’s feelings about being a filmmaker and then having to hand his work to distributors to release it into the world as they see fit, more than he sees fit. Obviously, he has asserted all the power he has to control his films, demanding a long theatrical window, for instance, and to support the control that other filmmakers have of their films.  The camaraderie with which Oppenheimer and the other scientists work towards The Bomb, even with all kinds of in-house conflict, is, I imagine, how Nolan sees his work as an artist in the process of filmmaking, which can be dominated by one person (especially a writer/director/producer), but cannot be achieved by one person at anything like this kind of scale. You can lead, but you need a big village to follow and, at its best, add to your visions.  Obviously, a movie bomb doesn’t kill people like an atom bomb. But again, I would suggest that any artist, especially those who do have a large mainstream reach, considers the influence of their work on the world of filmic art… and sometimes, the world in whole.  But getting any movie made, much less a movie of massive scale, skill, and grace, requires some degree of myopia. Any multi-faceted discussion of Leni Riefenstahl may inspire fist fights, but it is unlikely that while making her films, she was thinking about how she was supporting the annihilation of millions of people. I am not saying that is a good excuse. But perspective matters. In Oppenheimer, one of the most controversial moments, even for people who like the film a lot, is a bit of purely symbolic nudity and sex between Oppenheimer and Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock in the midst of the private hearing/prosecution over his security clearance. Some see it as random and unneeded, but it shows us how vulnerable he feels when he is forced to discuss his sex life, initially just stripped himself, and then in the imagined sex act with the dead women with whom he had one of the few relationships that seems to have really mattered to him. It’s also a critical moment in defining his relationship with his wife, Kitty, as he is aware that Tatlock haunts her too, as much as she has tried to stiff-upper-lip it.  Some ask why Jean Tatlock is showing more skin than Oppenheimer in the interrogation scene. I don’t think that Nolan or anyone else was really measuring for effect. For me, it is one of the most beautiful images I’ve ever seen on loss and regret and knowing how someone you love is being hurt by your actions while you have no power to escape the moment. Tatlock’s sex is very purposeful, in all 3 of their sex scenes. She seems to be getting something Kitty doesn’t get… and likely, doesn’t want. And Jean has no interest in the surface things that are part of what drives Kitty. The two women, confronting each other in words and imagination, are Oppenheimer’s ying and yang. As long I am digressing to discussing the great moments of the film, another segment on Oppenheimer’s fear and regret comes in a Los Alamos celebration rally. "
"Aug 1, 2023",positive," If nothing else, director/writer Christopher Nolan is a patient man. Whether it be his slow build of the psychological monolith that is “Batman Begins” or the controlled death spiral into the corners of the psyche in “Inception,” Nolan has never been in a rush. He has continued that approach with “Oppenheimer” which at times is the undisputed best picture released so far this year and at other times one of the most frustrating. This all comes from how Nolan begins to quietly unfold the story of one of the most monumental moments in human history and then eventually gets to the big explosive moment. “Oppenheimer” – based on the biography American Prometheus – examines the decision during World War II by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) to appoint physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to oversee the top-secret Manhattan Project. America is in a race with Germany to be the first to construct the first atomic bomb. Oppenheimer’s solution is to bring together the greatest scientific minds to a remote location in New Mexico to design the weapon. This led to the first nuclear explosion in 1945, an event that redefined the world. Nolan’s approach to the story was to build an arc of Oppenheimer’s life from his days as an eager student to his battles to save his reputation. This works because of a transformative performance by Murphy as the man who would become known as the father of the atomic bomb. Murphy and Nolan worked together on the “Batman” trilogy and that history shows in this film. Every moment Murphy is on screen is a controlled delivery of deep and dark emotions. He never has to adjust the volume of his performance as the historical significance is enough to elevate each click through the scientist’s life. His performance is in perfect step with Nolan’s directing style. Nolan’s methodical approach to the story becomes so dependent on the players that what should have been the biggest bombshell – the creation and use of the atomic bomb – is almost a footnote. It ends up just being the link between the first hour of the movie that establishes the characters and story points and the final hour where the emotional and political blasts finally reach the audience. The easy approach would have been to focus on the Nazis as the villains of the story. That specter always hangs over the film but Nolan’s determined approach leads to a more immediate threat from the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The full story of the bloody war between Strauss and Oppenheimer isn’t revealed until the third hour of the film. When Nolan finally decides to disclose that element, the movie takes on a tension as great as the race to build the super weapon. Unlike his work in “Dunkirk,” Nolan has not strayed too far away from the actual historical events. It was his blatant manipulation of the real story of the soldier evacuation during World War that ended up being a major flaw in that production. “Oppenheimer” so often plays like the readings of a transcript that even moments that had to be filled in come across with a realistic punch. A sticking point with “Oppenheimer” is the time element. Nolan always has looked at time as more of a blip than continuous thread from “Memento” to “Tenet.” That is acceptable with a fictional tale but there needs to be a more linear approach when it comes to history. As Nolan skips back and forth through Oppenheimer’s life, it becomes a test to keep track of whether the events are pre-bomb, during the creation of the bomb or the postmortem bomb world. A few time markers would have been handy. Nolan also continues to struggle with how to use women in his male-dominated tales. Emily Blunt turns in an impressive performance as Oppenheimer’s troubled wife but she is never used enough. And Florence Pugh’s role of Jeanne Tatlock – Oppenheimer’s on-again, off-again lover – comes across less as a way of showing the womanizing ways of the scientist and more of a nod to being gratuitous. Despite a few minor problems, Nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power. It may take some time but eventually Nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Aug 1, 2023",positive,"Oppenheimer is on the cusp of changing the world, mostly for the worst, but barely focuses on the moral quandary of this. All the Nolan beats but were missing the snarky Sorkin dialogue of A Few Good Men and smooth Tarantino style of Inglourious Basterds."
"Aug 1, 2023",positive,"[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch. "
"Aug 1, 2023",positive,"If it does nothing else, this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war, and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago."

"Aug 1, 2023",negative," “Oppenheimer” is a White-Jewish male view of history and that POV provides an old-fashioned slightly East Coast-biased or Anglo-centric view of history despite attempts to make the film fill its diversity quota. The film is disappointing in its blazing whiteness that blinds us to the truth of the world that J. Robert Oppenheimer worked in and, without the complications of racist reactions during a time of heightened hatred, the audience is misled to the historic conclusions. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Oppenheimer.”  The book was given the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. I have not read the book so I can only comment on the film and what secondary sources report. Oppenheimer is portrayed as Jewish, but since he is portrayed by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, we should consider him as a white-passing Jew. We meet the 22-year-old J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1926 on a dark and rainy day. Before the title, a caption tells us: “Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.” This young man is tortured by homesickness. He’s far from home (Manhattan) and studying under Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy) at the Cavendish Laboratory in the University of Cambridge. Blackett, an experimental physicist, is reminded that Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) is giving a lecture. Oppenheimer has broken equipment in his lab experiment and Blackett forces him to miss the lecture since he must, at the very least, clean up for himself. Out of spite, Oppenheimer uses a hypodermic to poison an apple left on Blackett’s desk. Oppenheimer catches the very end of the lecture, but asks a question, a question that he has asked before. Bohr made foundational contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum theory for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. He had founded the Niels Bohr institute (then known as the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen) in 1920.  The next day, regretting his decision to poison Blackett, he rushes to find that Bohr has the apple in his hand. Claiming there is a worm hole (the kind that involves a bug and not space), he quickly dispatches the apple to the trash and has a discussion with Bohr who asks “The important thing isn’t can you read music, it’s can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?”  Oppenheimer is a lab disaster but he can hear the music of the universe and  transfers to the University of Göttingen, (officially the Georg August University of Göttingen). In 1942, Oppenheimer meets US Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) and becomes involved in what will be called the Manhattan Project: The race to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis. The Nazis have Heisenberg heading their nuclear weapons program. The US has many immigrant scientists, some who have escaped the Nazis by fleeing to the US or the UK. While Groves questions Oppenheimer about his communist activities, Oppenheimer assures him that this won’t be a problem. Yet, we know that in the future it will be and the future is represented in another timeline filmed in black-and-white. Oppenheimer assembles a team that includes Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), Isidor Issac Rabi (David Drumholtz), Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham) and David L. Hill (Rami Malek)  at Los Alamos, New Mexico. He attempts to recruit Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), but fails. Los Alamos isn’t the only site, but the central location between UCB (Radiation Lab), Caltech (Project Camel), University of Chicago, Columbia University, Oak Ridge (Tennessee) and other locations. Oppenheimer has a love for New Mexico that predates the US entry into the war in 1941 so this is perhaps the real reason New Mexico was chosen over other desert states (e.g. Nevada, Arizona). The whole project is so hush-hush that all team members must compartmentalize their lives. Yet although married, Oppenheimer continues his affair with Tatlock although he eventually begins to distance himself from her. When he learns of her suicide in 1944 (4 January 1944), he is devastated. His affair will come back to haunt both his professional and personal life.   The race against Germany becomes a moot point when Germany surrenders in the spring of 1945. For reference (but not present in the film), Benito Mussolini is executed 25 April 1945; Adolf Hitler commits suicide 30 April 1945. Oppenheimer still believes the atom bomb will be necessary for the war with Japan. Pressed to complete and test the bomb before the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945 meeting of Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee and President Harry S. Truman in Potsdam, Germany) , the bomb is tested (Trinity Test on 16 July 1945) despite poor weather.  In the post-war world, Oppenheimer is a hero, but after Oppenheimer embarrasses Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), also an American White-passing Jew, Strauss, as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, works to remove Oppenheimer from his position of political influence. Strauss also believe that Oppenheimer turned Einstein against him. Strauss will ultimately pay for his pettiness and Oppenheimer is given recognition much later.  I knew that I had two timelines that we were running in the film. One is in color, and that’s Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. That’s the bulk of the film. Then the other is a black and white timeline. It’s a more objective view of his story from a different character’s point of view. Scenes in black and white (Kodak created and FotoKem developed black-and-white photographic film for IMAX) show a different timeline. That alone merits re-watching the film.  You won’t be disappointed with the depiction of the detonation of the first atom bomb, but there will be other things that are disappointing despite obvious attempts to include diversity by showing African Americans in the backgrounds (as well as, according to IMDb on 31 July 2023, uncredited appearances of Ansa Woo as female student #70, Jack Wang as Cambridge student and Aamir Yusuf as Cambridge student) and including women as intelligent people.  SPOILER ALERT: The sex scene features Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. Pugh stops during intercourse, gets up and goes over to the bookshelf, picks out a copy of the “Bhagavad Gita” and asks Murphy to read from it. Murphy reads the line “I am become Death, destroyer of worlds,” the quote from the “Bhagavad Gita” that Oppenheimer famously thought of when the first nuclear bomb was detonated – as intercourse resumes. While in a GQ interview Murphy says that the sex scenes were “vital” in this film because “the relationship that he has with Jean Tatlock is one of the most crucial emotional parts of the film,” the scenes are modest in their display of the male body. My husband thought this was to prevent an R-rating, but the film has an R-rating and comes 38 years after the nude scene in “A Room with a View” which featured Rupert Graves (as Freddy Honeychurch), Simon Callow (Reverend Beebe) and Julian Sands (George Emerson). That scene is non-sexual and makes the “Oppenheimer” scene where both Jean Tatlock and Oppenheimer are post-coital and having a discussion sitting across from each other with Murphy having his legs coyly crossed so that while the camera lovingly considers Pugh’s naked breasts, Murphy’s penis is well hidden by the carefully crossed and never uncrossed legs. (I’m thinking of Sharon Stone in the 1992 “Basic Instinct”).  If there needs to be nudity, why are we only given female genitals to admire? Could there have been a discussion of the Hindu scripture at a bookstore or over coffee? Yes, but it would likely not have had the same memorable impact for heterosexual men.  The nudity here only serves the heterosexual male gaze and thus, it would seem the nudity isn’t really vital because the display of male genitalia isn’t important to this film. If Oppenheimer’s genitalia don’t give us clues to his crucial emotional attachment to Tatlock, then the exposure of Tatlock’s breasts provide no clues either, particularly since we aren’t making a comparison between Tatlock and Oppenheimer’s wife.  According to an Art News article, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography of Oppenheimer, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the book on which Nolan’s film is based upon, notes that Oppenheimer was raised in a Manhattan family whose art collection included works of Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Rembrandt van Rijn, Édouard Vuillard and Vincent Van Gogh.  This exposure to art seems to be symbolized in the film by the appearance of painting that Art News identifies as Picasso’s “Woman Sitting with Crossed Arms.” The 1937 painting is currently at the Musée Picasso in Paris and is of Marie-Thérèse Walter, a woman whom “Picasso began seeing romantically when he was 45 and she was 17 in 1927.” The question then becomes why Picasso, particularly of a painting that was not in his family’s collection? Early on in the film, Oppenheimer, as played by Cillian Murphy, rises as a physicist in training. He meets the legendary scientist Niels Bohr, who devised a legendary model for atoms that is still used today, and is turned on to the magic of the discipline. “Can you hear the music?” Bohr asks Oppenheimer at one point, referring to the imagined sounds of invisible particles going about their business. Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the University of Göttinge. According to the Atomic Archive, Oppenheimer arrived at the German university in 1926 where he studied under Max Born.  Writing for ArtNews, Alex Greenberger suggests that the choice may be “Pablo-matic.” Picasso’s behavior toward women was bad as was Oppenheimer’s. Oppenheimer’s philandering is portrayed in the film. My husband thought the Picasso painting represented Oppenheimer’s interests in the Spanish Civil War which would eventually get him in trouble. The year of “Woman Sitting with Crossed Arms” is the year that his father died and his father’s death, according to Britannica, “left Oppenheimer a fortune that allowed him to subsidize anti-fascist organizations.” Brittanica also notes that “the tragic suffering inflicted by Joseph Stalin on Russian scientists led him to withdraw his associations with the Communist Party” though Brittanica quickly notes that he never joined the party.  The timeline Britannica presents is that in 1939, Oppenheimer began an affair with the married Katharine Puening–a botany grad student at UCLA whom he would marry in 1940.  Yet by introducing art, London-born British and American director Nolan has opened a Pandora’s box. How can this Oppenheimer, a man aware of art be totally ignorant of Japanese influence in California?  Japonism describes the influence of Japanese art, especially Ukiyo-e prints (literally, pictures of the floating [or everyday] world), on French artists in the second half of the 19th century. These prints were first exhibited in the Japan Pavilion at the 1867 Paris World’s Fair, but also later at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1890. The term Japonism was coined in 1872 by the French art critic Phillippe Burty to describe the influence of Japanese decorative objects as well as woodcuts on European art. Usually, the term is applied to the work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, who were specifically influenced by the flat blocks of color, the emphasis on design, and the simple, everyday subject matter. However, the woodcuts of Vallotton also demonstrate this influence with their flat shapes and asymmetrical design, as do many of the works of Bonnard and Vuillard, who painted scenes of everyday life taken from unusual points of view. Van Gogh considered Japanese prints a model of pure artistic expression, uncorrupted by Western modes of representation: “Japanese art is something like the primitives, like the Greeks, like our old Dutchmen, Rembrandt, Potter, Hals, Vermeer, Ostade, Ruisdael,” he wrote to Theo in July 1888. “It doesn’t end.” Rather than simply continuing to copy Japanese prints, though, Van Gogh began experimenting with aspects of them in his own paintings, including the use of bright, flat colours and strong diagonals, close-up and bird’s-eye views, unconventional cropping, the omission of the horizon, and the isolation of prominent objects, such as large cut-off tree trunks, in the foreground. Inspired by the natural world, he painted flowers, including, on several memorable occasions, irises – comparing one of these springtime views to “a Japanese dream”. The Japanese influence can be seen, and felt, in its simplicity and by incorporating themes from nature. Shibusa, or shibui in its adjectival form, is an important concept in Japanese aesthetics. While not easily translated, it has been described as a calm understatement, a quiet and sober refinement, severe exquisiteness and interesting beauty. Just as they sought to improve modern design by looking at previous styles such as the Gothic, Arts and Crafts practitioners embraced Japanese forms. They admired Japanese works because they, like medieval art, were thought to derive from a culture that was free from the depravities of modern industrialism. As designers grew more knowledgeable about Japanese art and culture they began emulating not merely the surface motifs they saw in the works, but their underlying design strategies. There are two California universities mentioned in “Oppenheimer”: the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. It would seem disingenuous for the film to pretend that Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists in California were unaware of the anti-East Asian racism present in Berkeley or Pasadena and the effects it had in these two institutes.  In the spring of 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry in Berkeley had one week to pack and prepare for their forced trip to the Tanforan racetrack in San Bruno. They would be housed there for months in the horse stable stalls until they were transferred to remote areas. For Berkeley, that meant 1,300 residents. Those residents included UC Berkeley faculty (e.g. art professor Chuira Obata, who was at UCB 1932-1954) and staff as well as about 500 students.  At the UCB 1942 commencement, Sproul announced “That the senior class’s top student ‘cannot be here today because his country called him elsewhere.'” That student, Harvey Akio Itano, had three weeks earlier been sent with his family to an internment camp (Tule Lake). Itano, who received his BS in chemistry, had been chosen by the faculty as the University Medalist for 1942. He would become a professor of Pathology, ME, Ph.D. at UC San Diego.  At Caltech, there were also professors who worked to assist their students.  Professor Linus Pauling “fought particularly hard for two of his research assistants, Miyoshi Ikawa and Carol Ikeda. In both cases, Pauling’s intervention prevented these colleagues from being forcibly interned.” Pauling found Ikawa a place in the graduate program at the University of Wisconsin. Ikawa would return to do postdoctoral research at both Caltech and UC Berkeley before becoming a professor at the University of New Hampshire. Ikeda completed his Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska. He would later work at DuPont.  Pauling was briefly a friend of Oppenheimer, having met him in Europe (June 1927). When Oppenheimer accepted the position that split his time between Caltech and Berkeley, the friendship was renewed. However, when Oppenheimer invited Pauling’s wife, Ava Helen to travel with him to Mexico, and she reported this to Pauling, Pauling “immediately cut ties with Oppenheimer.”  According to “The Pauling Blog,” Oppenheimer did extend an invitation for Pauling “to lead the chemistry division” for the Manhattan Project. After Oppenheimer was given a loyalty hearing before the Atomic Energy Commission, Pauling wrote an article that was published in “The Nation”: “A Disgraceful Act” (1 May 1954).  Another researcher at Caltech, Robert A. Emerson, persuaded “government officials to permit rubber research to take place at the camps, and then he had to convince Japanese American scientists and nurserymen to join the project. Significantly, he enticed his former graduate student, Shimpe Nishimura to stay in the United States and eventually take over leadership of the Manzanar research.” People who worked on the project included chemist Kenzie Nozaki and Frank Hirosawa, Dr. Masuo Kodani, Homer Kimura, Shuichi Ogura and Frank Kageyama.  Kodani was from Pasadena (born in Los Angeles) and had been a student at UCB, graduated in 1938. His German Jewish emigre advisor, Richard Goldschmidt, had tried to find him a position on the East Coast, but was unsuccessful.  Ogura was born in Pasadena and was a visiting student at Caltech.  While Manzanar was in California, there were three internment camps in New Mexico:Lordsburg, Ft. Stanton and Santa Fe. Lordsburg, NM is about 400 miles or 5-6 hours away from Los Alamos. Ft. Stanton, NM is about 220 miles or four hours. Santa Fe to Los Alamos is about 1 hour or 34 miles.  Lordsburg (US Army-run internment camp) held Japanese internees from Hawaii, the continental US and Alaska from 1942-1943. The internees were moved, mostly to Santa Fe, so that prisoners of war from Italy and Germany could be held there. Ft. Stanton (INS) held mostly German seamen and German enemy aliens but was also a secret detention camp where 17 Japanese American dissidents were held for six months. The Santa Fe Internment Camp (INS) was located just 1.5 miles from downtown Santa Fe and eventually 4,555 male internees passed through.  The New York Magazine article, “Who Are the Japanese in Oppenheimer?”  Ryu Spaeth, a features editor at New York Intelligencer wondered where the Japanese were in Nolan’s film.  It is not Nolan’s job to faithfully depict the Japanese. He has made a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer after all. But some common understanding of this faraway foil is necessary for us to comprehend this historical figure’s significance. Nolan is most concerned with the fact that Oppenheimer brought us into the nuclear age, which gave humanity the ability for the first time to destroy itself. The legacy of the bomb, however, is more specific and concrete than Oppenheimer’s final vision of a world engulfed in nuclear fire. At the very same instant that the bomb created modern Japan in a burst of light, it also gave rise to the America we know today — America as superpower. Two new nations were born from this expression of the bomb’s divine power, and the cost of this transformation, like some ghastly blood sacrifice, were those 220,000 human beings who were either incinerated or succumbed to radiation poisoning, human beings Oppenheimer said were necessary to target to show what havoc the weapon could really wreak, which is to say that the inauguration of the American century would not have happened without the Japanese. But, of course, America does not see itself as sharing its history with anyone, let alone that it has a ghostly sibling on the other side of the world. Which is how Kai Bird, writing for the New York Times on the occasion of Oppenheimer’s release, can say with a straight face that the “real tragedy” of Oppenheimer’s life was that it discouraged scientists from standing up “in the political arena as public intellectuals.” Well, no — the tragedy is that his genius was literally weaponized against a country that may no longer have posed a threat to him or his country, against people who have been forgotten by their opponents, if they were ever known at all. Would it really be possible for Oppenheimer to have been oblivious to the anti-Asian sentiment in California and the internment of Japanese American teachers, faculty and students from Caltech or UCB?  Shamefully, anti-semitism emerged even there. When Oppenheimer recommended a top student, Bob Serber, to be hired, the appointment was blocked by department Chairman Raymond T. Birge, who wrote a colleague saying “one Jew in the department was enough.” Moreover, “Oppenheimer” represents the project as mostly a men’s club. Looking at the US Department of Energy’s interactive history of the Manhattan Project, it seems the project was a boys club. However, there were women involved and not just the one at Los Alamos who in the film notes she (Czech-American Lilli Hornig) was asked if she could type. Hornig, who is portrayed by Olivia Thirlby, was Jewish and had accompanied her husband, Donald Hornig (played by David Rysdahl) to Los Alamos. The film does include some debate on plutonium chemistry perhaps being too dangers for women (particularly in reference to reproduction).  But the world she graduated into, on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attacks, was rife with sexism and anti-Asian racism, and Wu found it hard to find a good academic position.  Because of World War II and the subsequent Communist takeover, she would never see her parents alive again. She is believe to be the only Chinese American working on the Manhattan Project.  It was reported that in 1940 you were listed as a sponsor of the Friends of the Chinese People, an organization which was characterized in 1944 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities as a Communist-front organization. The second Sino-Japanese war had already begun in 1937 (the first Sino-Japanese War was 1894-1895) with the 29 July 1937 Tongzhou mutiny, then the Nanjing Massacre that began on 13 December 1937. The Chinese themselves were not a unified front having conducted a communist purge in Jiangxi-Fujian (1931-1935) and the CCP purged  Koreans (Minsaengdan incident)  suspected of supporting the Japanese occupiers (1933-1936).  The wartime hysteria affected not only Japanese Americans, but also the Chinese and other East Asians. Remember, California had led or supported many anti-Asian legal initiatives from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to Alien Land Laws.  The wartime hysteria as well as the virulent anti-Asian sentiment in California is not mentioned at all in “Oppenheimer.” If one cannot intelligently discuss World War II in Europe without touching on anti-Semitism in Germany, Europe and the US, then one cannot possibly intelligently discuss the war against Japan without discussing racism toward Japanese and East Asians in the US, UK and Canada. Even when someone mentions Pearl Harbor, perhaps the average person in the US  forgets that the population of Hawaii in 1940 was predominately Japanese (139,631 compared to Caucasian at 112,087). The Chinese were 27,179 and the Filipino population was 63,052 (Koreans were 6,851 and Native Hawaiian were 64,310). Mainland USA had racist laws targeting East Asians, Filipinos and Native Hawaiians as well as Latinos and Native Americans during that time period.  Japan had been a US and UK ally in World War I so the question should be what soured that relationship. To understand the full impact and implications of dropping the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, one has to discuss anti-East Asian racism in the US, UK and Canada. Post World War II, the Japanese (A crew of 23 men on the Daigo Fukuryū Maru 第五福龍丸were contaminated by the nuclear fallout on 1 March 1954) and Pacific Islanders were affected by 24 subsequent nuclear bomb detonations for testing between 1947-1958 at the Bikini Atoll.  To understand the impact of the Los Alamos on New Mexico, racism toward Latinos and Native Americans in the West (California, Arizona, New Mexico, etc.) needs to be discussed. In the film, Murphy’s Oppenheimer blithely assures there’ll be no problem acquiring Los Alamos, “There’s a boys’ school we’ll have to commandeer, and the local Indians come up here for burial rites.” This is barren land, except it wasn’t.  There were, in fact, dozens of families within 20 miles, largely poor families of ranchers and farmers, many Hispanic and Indigenous, who unwittingly went about their daily lives in the first fallout of the atomic age. Now, those who were infants and children downwind of the detonation of the “Gadget”—a code name for the plutonium bomb used in the Trinity test—are nearing the end of a decades-long battle to be recognized and compensated for generations of illness they trace to exposure from radioactive fallout. It should be noted that there was a Latino team member of the Manhattan Project: Luis Alvarez (portrayed by Alex Wolff). Wolff is not Latino, but his father was Jewish. Alvarez’s grandfather was a Spanish physician born in Spain who lived in Cuba before settling in the US.  Nolan’s source was written by two White men. Sherwin was born in Brooklyn, New York and died in Washington, DC (2021). He had served in the US Navy in Japan and received his Ph.D. in history at the UCLA in 1971. That’s just a year before David Carradine would begin his yellow face run as Eurasian Kwai Chang Caine in the TV series “Kung Fu.” Sherwin had also published “A World Destroyed: Hiroshima and Its Legacies” in 1975.  Sherwin’s co-author, Kai Bird, was named after a refugee from Communist China, and educated in India (high school), but his BA was from Carleton College (Northfield, Minnesota) and his MS was from Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois). He has been a freelance journalist in Yemen, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.  The book  “American Prometheus” was also published almost two decades ago (18 years).  This was after the Japan-bashing of the 1980s and 1990s, but before the current rise in anti-Asian sentiment related to  the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, about 1,200 people marched in  Berkeley to protest anti-Asian hate. In Los Angeles, a solidarity march was held in Koreatown (27 March 2021)/ In New York (22 March 2021), there was a demonstration in Manhattan’s Chinatown.  The year 2021 was when Universal Pictures won the bidding war for Nolan’s  “Oppenheimer” script, but anti-Asian racism began to rise in 2020 with the international public health emergency measures.  Nolan’s scripting of “Oppenheimer” might have been better suited for the audiences of 2005. In the film, Japanese people are an abstraction and anti-East Asian prejudice in the West Coast and the US is as non-existent as the concerns of the people of New Mexico. There were people who were living in New Mexico before Oppenheimer inherited money from his father in 1937 and bought his Perro Caliente ranch and before Los Alamos was built in 1942.  In the film “Oppenheimer,” the desert is portrayed as a wasteland instead of a fragile ecological system and a place where many generations of people had lived and would be, as we know today, secretly suffering from Trinity’s radioactive fallout for decades. The possibility of cell damage and negative effects on reproductive cells is broached in the film, in the discussion about Hornig working with plutonium chemistry, but the downwinders are given no consideration in the film. And it isn’t the case that the scientists didn’t come into contact with the downwinders who, according to the Slate article, were recruited for construction or custodial work. In the 2014-2015 TV fictionalized TV series, “Manhattan,” a Chinese American scientist (Dr. Sidney Liao who is played by Eddie Shin) and day laborers and maids are included in the cast. It’s one thing to think of an enemy an ocean away as an abstraction, but another to callously decide the people working service jobs for the main characters as unworthy of safety considerations. In this age that calls for diversity, one has to ask: In 2023, do we really need a White male compartmentalized version of history, even if its idea of diversity is the inclusion of Jewish American main characters (Oppenheimer, Strauss and Einstein) and some consideration of White women?  “Oppenheimer” had its world premiere in Paris (11 July 2023) and then it’s British premiere in London (13 Justly 2023), followed by its US premiere on 17 July 2023. “Oppenheimer” was released theatrically in the US by Universal Pictures on 21 July 2023. "
"Aug 1, 2023",positive," J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist in charge of the project, and many others sweat it out in the New Mexico desert as they watch the test from what they hope is a safe distance. Oppenheimer has told the military head of the operation, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, that chances of the explosion destroying the world are “near zero.” Groves’ response is that “zero” would be a much more comforting answer. Spoiler alert: The world was not destroyed. But, watching this unfold on the screen, waiting for the button to be pushed to set off the bomb, you can’t help but hold your breath and grip the armrests of your chair. That alone tells you something about “Oppenheimer” (R, 180 minutes, in theaters). Christopher Nolan’s epic film bio/thriller is so gripping that you feel like you’re right there with Oppenheimer, anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash – never mind the horrors it did unleash. In telling Oppenheimer’s story, writer-director Nolan (“Dunkirk,” “Inception”) tells a complex story about a complicated, brilliant man. Nolan doesn’t just focus on Oppenheimer’s involvement in the Manhattan Project, which led to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending World War II. Among other things, it deals with Oppenheimer’s personal life, his Communist ties and the postwar political repercussions of his leftist leanings. In covering all of this, and jumping back and forth in time in the process, Nolan presents an expansive story that seems oddly misshapen, in which, for instance, the third act, post-bomb, is extended into a story in itself. In this case it doesn’t seem to matter much, though. (Another example where it doesn’t matter: “Lawrence of Arabia,” a magnificent epic whose first half is much stronger than the second.) “Oppenheimer” is a breathtaking achievement, and for many reasons: the exceptional performances; Hoyte Van Hoyutema’s majestic cinematography (see this film on the largest screen possible); Ludwig Goransson’s grinding, buzzing soundtrack, which amps up the suspense; the intelligence on display (given my limitations, I had to assume much of the scientific dialogue made sense); the still-relevant moral questions the film asks regarding weapons and war, and the responsibilities of science and innovation. Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with the same restraint that makes his gangster character in “Peaky Blinders” so compelling. You’re not encouraged to like Oppenheimer, or even necessarily understand him. He’s an intellectual snob, a cold fish with an unpredictable moral compass (he has no apparent qualms about sleeping with friends’ wives, for instance). Outwardly, he celebrates the success of the atomic bomb, but he’s also tortured by that success and tells President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, in one brief scene) that he feels he has blood on his hands (Harry doesn’t take this well). Wearing a wide-brimmed hat and suit, Cillian’s Oppenheimer looks like a scientific gunslinger – a brainy variation on a Clint Eastwood or Gary Cooper Western character – as he strolls through the Los Alamos desert community he creates for his scientific team. He is the stuff of legend. Members of the all-star supporting cast also are remarkable. Robert Downey Jr., in heavy makeup as a manipulative political figure out to destroy Oppenheimer’s reputation, and Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer’s bitter, alcoholic wife, deliver Oscar-caliber portrayals as characters different from any they’ve played before (at least, that I’m aware of). Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s Communist lover, and Matt Damon, as Groves, also are excellent. (Also in the cast: Oldman, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Conti – as Einstein, Casey Affleck, Jason Clarke, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Matthew Modine … it’s quite the ensemble.) Much has been made about “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” opening on the same day. Maybe it’s because they both are potential blockbusters in direct competition. Maybe it’s because of the filmmakers involved, since Nolan and Gerwig are about as highly regarded as anyone these days. Maybe it’s because it’s hard to imagine two films being more different. “Barbie” (PG-13, 114 minutes, in theaters), co-written by director Gerwig (“Lady Bird,” “Little Women”) and Noah Baumbach (“The Squid and the Whale”), stars Margot Robbie as the living version of the famous Barbie doll, and Ryan Gosling as her (sort of) boyfriend, beach- and Barbie-obsessed Ken. Barbie and Ken live with other variations of Barbie and Ken in Barbieland, where almost everything is pink and, according to Barbie, “Every day is the best day ever.” That is, until Barbie starts thinking of death, and visits Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), and learns about cellulite and other real-life phenomena. Barbie and Ken wind up heading out to the real world, where they are exposed to other things like, oh, the patriarchy, and Barbie befriends a mother, Gloria (America Ferrera), and daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). It’s a clever idea to use Barbie and Ken to explore gender roles and relationships, personal identity and so forth. If asked to name a toy for girls on “Family Feud,” no doubt Barbie would be first on the list, but the Mattel doll certainly can be, and has been, accused of setting up destructively unrealistic expectations in terms of body type and conforming to dated perceptions of women. Through this story, Gerwig suggests that Barbie – and even lunkhead Ken – can change with the times. At the same time, the film expresses the exasperation of modern women – especially through an amazing speech delivered by Gloria about the impossible, contradictory demands placed on them. “Barbie” has a lot of good qualities besides this speech. Robbie and Gosling go for broke as their silly characters (who struggle to understand where romance leads, given they have no genitalia), and they pull it off. The art direction involved in the creation of Barbieland – along with the costume design, the hair and makeup, etc. – brilliantly engulf you in a colorful fantasy world. The problem is that a little amount of Barbie and Ken goes a long way, and the film eventually comes off as one-note. “Barbie” could have been a great “Saturday Night Live” skit, or even a series of “SNL” skits. But like some of those skits that have been turned into movies – “Coneheads” and the “Wayne’s World” movies come to mind – there’s not enough there to justify a feature-length film.

"Jul 31, 2023",positive," Why settle for only one review when you can have many points of view? “Oppenheimer” is a dense historical film that several of us at InTheirOwnLeague has definite opinions about so read on and see if you agree with any of us on this new opus by Christopher Nolan. Christopher Nolan has directed his best feature yet with “Oppenheimer.” Walking into this film without knowing much about Oppenheimer and his historical impact was a recipe that could have easily been disastrous. In fact, it did take me a little bit before I became invested in the film. The non-linear storytelling was a little confusing, but halfway through the first act, I was on board.  This is a fascinating character study of a troubled human being dealing with the moral dilemma of his creation. As a woman of science, the conversations about the atom and quantum physics were music to my ears. I was geeking out, but it left me contemplating the bioethics involved in this scenario. As scientists and explorers of the world, we have a natural tendency to discover and experiment, but where do we draw the line? And how should we deal with the political machinations that push and manipulate scientists?  Nolan’s name comes with a level of prestige, and he doesn’t disappoint. The sound, score, cinematography, acting and overall execution are immaculate. The film left me admiring the brilliance of the human brain and heartbroken with the reality of our complete lack of sympathy towards other human beings. The ego is blinding, and seeking control and power oftentimes ends in atrocities and horrors.  With Christopher Nolan’s latest film, it sometimes feels like he is looking back to his breakthrough film, “Memento” (2000). Both films look at a person responsible for death being controlled by someone else- unlike Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is at the whims of a government thinking more about the world supremacy that comes with an atomic bomb than the morality of having one. Grey moral areas are Nolan’s specialty, and he brings all his narrative tools to the haunted life of Oppenheimer, and the politics surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb, its use, and the nuclear proliferation to follow. Great performances- from the intensely internal one from Cillian Murphy to the subtly bombastic Robert Downey Jr. and everyone in between- and technical craft- with breathtaking cinematography, sound, and a tense score- carry this narrative in every way in what might be the director’s finest film. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was punished for eternity for giving fire to man. “Oppenheimer” (2023) is essentially the story of Prometheus, but this one is frighteningly true. A biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, it’s a chilling character study in which a man, through scientific genius and just the right motivation, gave humanity the power to eradicate itself through atomic warfare. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, Oppenheimer’s punishment was the overwhelming regret he felt once he realised what he had created. Writer-director Christopher Nolan could easily have turned this feature into one of excuses. But, through hypnotic editing and confrontational, yet empathetic, direction, he has made a staunchly anti-nuke film that decries the ways in which people desperately cling to modicums of supremacy. Despite its three-hour runtime the film flies by. The non-linear narrative introduces its conclusions so that we become drawn into how events unfolded, as one of science’s greatest minds becomes weighed down by his guilty conscience. This is a film in which innovative righteousness and patriotic celebration have their veils removed to reveal grotesque ambition and the screams of civilians dying at the hands of this grotesqueness. Through spellbinding visuals, a gripping script, and Cillian Murphy’s magnificent performance, this is not solely a remarkable character study. It’s a film that, through the filter of history, dazzles with its mastery of craft, directly challenging us on how the lust for power can, and perhaps will, one day destroy us all. A tour-de-force of storytelling and historical analysis, there is a strong case to be made for “Oppenheimer” being Nolan’s best film yet. Christopher Nolan, the most grandiose director currently working, took the metaphor of the man who built the atomic bomb and used it as an allegory for himself.  “Oppenheimer”’s plot is built around one of Oppenheimer’s critics, Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), and his behaviour towards Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) after the war. The twisting subplots of the building of the bomb, a security clearance-investigation Oppenheimer must endure, and Strauss’ senate confirmation which hinges on that investigation twirl around the black hole at the story’s center, which is the largely undepicted truth of what the bomb Oppenheimer built did. In an unusually stacked supporting cast Matt Damon, David Krumholtz, Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich stand out, but the women in Oppenheimer’s life, namely Emily Blunt as his wife and Florence Pugh as his Communist lover, have almost nothing to sink their teeth into. But anyone who’s seen Nolan’s previous work knows this is par for his course. Women are plot devices or ornaments, nothing more. It’s the men in suits who count. Men with the power to shape life by taking it away are the only ones who matter, and it’s their actions Nolan depicts, not their feelings. For a movie about the potential end of humanity the most heated chitter-chat is about unions in academia. Though Nolan lets Mr Murphy’s (exceptional) cheekbones do most of his expressing for him. And while Nolan is winning friends by speaking up for the workers in present-day Hollywood, the inescapable sense is that this entire exercise is just a salve for his enormous ego. I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone. The hallmarks of a Christopher Nolan film are all here in “Oppenheimer.” The lush cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the operatic and haunting score by Ludwig Göransson, the FX by Scott R. Fisher and company, all contribute to you knowing you’re watching a Nolan directed motion picture. The script is adapted from “American Prometheus” written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin which is more of a biography than an historical account of the Manhattan Project itself. This distinction is important in understanding the focus of the film on Oppenheimer himself and less on the story of the Manhattan Project, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the resulting Cold War.  That focus can be somewhat frustrating in its convenient glossing over of the terror that Oppenheimer’s work unleashed instead recounting his personal hell as a target of the McCarthy era. Robert Downey Jr. already has well deserved Oscar buzz swirling around his performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppie’s bugbear who stakes his career and reputation in destroying him publicly.  As astonishing as Cillian Murphy is as Oppenheimer, and he is incredible showing the emotional cost that eroded the man’s psyche and physical health, he is upstaged by the depiction of what he called the “gadget.” The Trinity test scene will leave you breathless but the true horror for me came afterwards in a scene that shows his scientists cheering for him and him congratulating them only for all to be reduced to ash in his mind’s eye. Truly nightmare fuel and you won’t leave the theater feeling safe and secure in your bed later on. That is the point of “Oppenheimer” and that is why this film is a must see."
"Jul 31, 2023",positive," This sprawling epic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb is the most balanced film yet from director Christopher Nolan, who has too often sacrificed character studies for spectacle. The easy part for director Christopher Nolan was making Oppenheimer a big-screen behemoth; a sprawling epic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb. Trickier was embedding within that blockbuster megaproduction a film of almost excruciating intimacy; a psychodrama that probes the soul of perhaps the 20th century’s most unknowable man. Mission accomplished on both counts: Movies don’t get any bigger than Oppenheimer, and seldom do they get under a character’s skin more effectively. This is the most balanced film yet from Nolan (Inception, Interstellar), who has too often sacrificed character studies for spectacle. First, the spectacle: Nolan has chosen to make Oppenheimer on 70mm IMAX film, a decision that creates a granular universe that pops to life even on the digital transfers most theaters will be showing. (A ridiculously obvious bit of advice: Absolutely see Oppenheimer on the biggest screen you can.) In the tradition of the maxi-screen medium, Nolan and his perennial cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema offer breathtaking vistas of the New Mexico desert and picture postcard images of the lush university campuses the characters frequent. Filming almost entirely at or near the original locations, in New Mexico Nolan even recreated The Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos town — every board and nail of it — conjuring (for me, anyway) temporary nervous memories of Michael Cimino’s calamitous rebuild of 1880s Casper, Wyoming, for Heaven’s Gate. Then there’s the movie’s centerpiece: The detonation of the world’s first nuclear device — called “The Gadget” by its creators — early one July morning in 1945. Following an excruciatingly long countdown (I had no stopwatch, but I suspect those last few seconds are substantially drawn out), the explosion erupts with hypnotic grace. Nolan takes dramatic advantage of the fact that, depending on how far away you are, you’ll see an explosion long before you feel and hear it. As the fireball fills the screen (Nolan does the whole thing without a single digital effect), the soundtrack is silent, except for the breathing of Oppenheimer, who has left the safety of his bunker to stand, mouth agape, in the open air. One knock on Nolan has long been that he doesn’t know when to tell his composers to put down their pens; here, Ludwig Göransson’s soaring score falls silent, with unnerving results. As for the human element, never before has Nolan found such perfect balance for a film’s secret sauce. Cillian Murphy seems born to play Oppenheimer — compare him here with photos of the physicist and it is, frankly, hard to tell them apart. Murphy’s wide blue eyes seem to stare in perpetual horror at visions of what Oppenheimer’s creation hath wrought; his haunted, gaunt visage betrays the scientist’s own private, lifelong condition of shock and awe concerning matters of quantum physics. Murphy is the singularity around which the entire film orbits, but the who’s who supporting cast suggests that all of Hollywood was waiting by the phone, hoping Nolan would call. Matt Damon, pleasingly lumpy and charmingly officious, is Gen. Leslie Groves, the military officer in charge of the Manhattan Project. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh play the most prominent women in Oppenheimer’s life (although there were, reportedly, many more), and they make it almost believable that anyone would be willing to devote their lives to a guy with his head not merely in the clouds, but in the cosmos. Only one actor has ever won an Oscar for acting in a Christopher Nolan film (that was Heath Ledger as Joker in The Dark Knight, and let’s face it: Ledger was a director-proof creature). Certainly, Murphy has a Best Actor shot this time, but the shoo-in Supporting Actor nod has got to go to Robert Downey, Jr. as Lewis Strauss, the 1950s tycoon who was alternately Oppenheimer’s greatest promoter and worst enemy. Downey disappears into the role, eyes like saucers behind round, dark eyeglasses, vanishing hair brushed into a pitiful comb-over. Embodying the twin qualities of power and paranoia, Downey evokes a late-career Henry Fonda, with compelling results. Elsewhere, beneath masterful makeup, you’ll spot Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Gary Oldman as Harry Truman, and Kenneth Branagh as physicist Niels Bohr. One guy turns up, seemingly, just to pick up something that Oppenheimer has dropped, and I could’ve sworn it was Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek. Sure enough, Malek returns an hour or so later to give one of the film’s pivotal speeches. Which brings up the one weak link in Oppenheimer’s cinematic chain reaction: its 3-hour length. (The studio released a photo of the celluloid IMAX version sitting on a projector noting that, unspooled, the physical film would stretch 11 miles, as if that were a good thing.) For such an assured piece of filmmaking, you’d think Nolan would have known when to end Oppenheimer. The climactic explosion comes roughly two hours into the film, then settles into chronicling the scientist’s turbulent McCarthy Era, during which he lost his security clearance — and access to government contracts — due to early contacts with American communists. Fair enough, but Nolan insists on subjecting Oppenheimer (and us) to one impassioned speech after another in front of a commission that we already know has been rigged (by Strauss) to toss him under the bus. It’s an important chapter, but compared to the world-changing events that came before, this one is worth, at most, 20 minutes or so. When the admittedly powerful finale finally came, I’m sorry to say I was glad Oppenheimer was over. And that’s no way to feel about a film that gets so much so monumentally right."
"Jul 30, 2023",positive," “Oppenheimer” is utter perfection. It’s a timeless movie for the ages, with a lengthy running time that’s worth every scene for its history, character development, direction and a memorable score. Director/co-screenwriter Christopher Nolan’s genius – also obvious in the likes of “Dunkirk,” “Inception” and “The Dark Knight,” is evident in every frame of this biopic/history of the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy, well known for “Peaky Blinders,” may very well earn the Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of the physicist who changed the outcome of World War II and, indeed, global politics. The audience sees Oppenheimer as a brilliant student of the world around him – art, languages, politics and science all intrigue the young man. He understands, when German scientists split the atom in 1938, that this achievement could be used in weaponry. Oppenheimer’s politics and his connections to the American Communist Party are called into question by Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon,) leader of The Manhattan Project, the United States’ name for the development of the atomic bomb. The rest, as they say, really is history, with an all-star cast including Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh, and Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife and Florence Pugh as his mistress. I still can’t believe this film is three hours long. I didn’t feel it. I never felt the time drag and every sequence is engaging. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Jul 29, 2023",positive," This line from T.S. Eliot‘s triumph of modernist poetry, The Waste Land, encapsulates Christopher Nolan‘s granular approach to the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb,” who reads the poem in his university days, haunted by visions of atoms and stardust, too tortured to sleep. Oppenheimer, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin‘s biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is an existentialist portrait of a man caught between his own petty humanity and his ability to peer into the very fabric of the universe and understand it. Over the course of three hours, Oppie (as his colleagues call him) finds himself both master of, and subject to, the principles of quantum physics, straining to reconcile the vast matrices of war and politics with his own almost obstinate naivete and blind loyalty to his own impulses. “Strong attractions,” as he tells his wife-to-be at a party when she asks him to explain his field of study. FissionAt its best, Oppenheimer is a character study that uses its protagonist to atomize the worldly implications of the distinction between theory and practice, between humanity and life as a human being, and Oppenheimer is the perfect vessel for the task. Embodied by Cillian Murphy, this complex figure is explored as more than just a part of history, but as a man, torn asunder by what Nolan rightly calls “impossible ethical dilemmas.” source: Universal PicturesOppenheimer‘s life is a mess of contradictions: As an adult, he went from the living rooms of the Leftist academic intelligentsia, to Los Alamos where he headed the top-secret Manhattan Project developing the A-bomb, and finally to a life of public activism against nuclear proliferation, a phenomenon he himself set into motion. This last also led to his systematic, underhanded discrediting by the United States–– a smear campaign that he did little to fight. Whether he likes it or not, as his Berkeley colleague, the eventual Nobel Prize Winner Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) frustratedly tells him, Oppenheimer isn’t “just self-important, [he’s] actually important.” The narrative of Oppenheimer‘s life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth. Yet Nolan‘s film fixates on the strange character of the man himself, presenting him as an impossible force and an immovable object, at odds with his own temperament. He can’t help but set himself up for failure at every turn: He is impulsive and egotistical, injecting cyanide into his professors’ apples (but snatching them away before they can be eaten), sleeping with other men’s wives (but always with flowers in hand), and ignoring his colleagues open warnings that his association with “known Communists” will pose a danger to his career (while actively refusing to join the Communist Party). He eagerly builds a weapon of mass destruction, yet crusades against new such devices soon thereafter. FusionNolan‘s directorial choices skillfully animate the deep psychological drama of his subject matter throughout. Murphy‘s performance is masterful, his weathered, skeletal face reflecting his character’s unpredictability with the grace of the clouds that cross the New Mexico sky. The arresting 65mm IMAX cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema captures this same duality, contrasting the washed-out tones of a midcentury photograph with the high-contrast monochrome of a Sidney Lumet or Otto Preminger film.source: Universal PicturesBoth modes feel lived-in, particularly the black and white, which manages to avoid the sensation of homage to an earlier period in (film) history, balancing classicism with freshness. Nolan’s script, though hampered by occasionally overwrought dialogue, is largely well-structured to weave past and present into a sinewed tapestry that evokes the occasionally jagged flow of memory, even as time moves inexorably forward without us. Like his protagonist, Nolan does occasionally lose himself in the more quotidian concerns of his personal project. His penchant for casting well-known actors sometimes proves distracting, most notably (for me) with the choice of former Drake and Josh star Josh Peck, whose virtually wordless performance is undeniably comic: he appears largely out of focus or half-glimpsed in the background. Other familiar faces fare better, Matt Damon brings warmth and bravado to his role as Lt. General Leslie Groves, the military director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey Jr.‘s Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss is suitably mendacious, but as the list grows longer and more inexplicable–– Tony Goldwyn, Alex Wolff, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and so on, and so on–– there are only diminishing returns to be found.source: Universal PicturesThe film’s few women (almost all Oppenheimer‘s lovers) are also given tragically little to do, though Emily Blunt and (particularly) Florence Pugh nevertheless manage to animate their textually thin characters beautifully. The film’s final hour, structured slightly more traditionally as a political procedural, drags relative to the rest of its runtime. ConclusionStill, the film’s poetic treatment of its subject overcomes these foibles to create something profound, expanding on themes Nolan began to explore in The Prestige, with David Bowie as Nicola Tesla: “You may live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension,” and, sometimes, you may be the one to create them. The film’s atemporal journey through Oppenheimer‘s subjectivity, from his petty arrogance to his martyred brilliance, is punctuated with dreamy flashes of surrealism–– psychedelic sojourns into atomic structure, strange premonitions of events to come, and even dazzling moments of pure hallucination ranging from erotic to nightmarish. His psyche inflects everything, down to the dust motes in the air at Los Alamos, whose delicate shadows ripple around him like the terrifying messengers of a nuclear apocalypse he’s envisioned since his university days reading The Waste Land.Another, more gruesome kind of dust swirls when he imagines the literal fallout of his creation, his foot crunching through the incinerated chest cavity of a colleague on the floor, a horrifying exercise in semi-sculptural transfiguration. Oppenheimer‘s matter-altering creation exists at the violent, perverse center of politics, science, and, in this film, modern art. Oppenheimer was released in theaters on July 21st, 2023. Watch OppenheimerPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

"Jul 29, 2023",positive," A biopic of masterful craft and heavy emotion, Oppenheimer is a high stakes story of war, politics, and the inner battle of a complicated  mind who changed the world with fire and fury. “Now I am become death. The destroyer of worlds”. This line  from the Bhagavad-Gita - a 700-verse Hindu scripture - was famously quoted by  Robert J. Oppenheimer during an NBC documentary that aired in 1965. Oppenheimer,  known universally as the “father of the atomic bomb”, is also the subject of  Christopher Nolan’s latest film and it is one of the revered director’s best  yet.  Intellectually engaging, visually and sonically  stimulating, and packing an emotional wallop, Oppenheimer further  cements Nolan’s standing as the thinking mans blockbuster filmmaker, while  placing the spotlight on one of the 21st centuries most brilliant  minds and his most infamous achievement: the creation of the atomic bomb that decimated  the Japanese islands of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, thus ending World War II. Skipping back and forth between different time periods, as  well as black and white and colour photography, Nolan knocks the dust off the  stuffy biopic formula and delivers a movie that is pulsating with energy and  epic in scope. He also does so without losing the intimacy of retracing the  peaks and valleys in the life of a giant in the science community, a man whose  logic driven approach to his work is often upended by the unconventional and  even egotistical blunders made in his personal life. 

                                        Cillian Murphy delivers perhaps his best feature film  performance yet as Oppenheimer, portraying the eccentricities and fragilities  of this brilliant mind with an impressive restraint as the guilt that consumes  Oppenheimer slowing eats him up inside. Great too are the films numerous  supporting performances: Robert Downey Jr. delivers one of his best turns as Lewis  Strauss, the bitter and shrewd head of the Atomic Energy Commission; Matt Damon  brings his magnetic movie star charisma to the role of General Leslie Groves,  the director of the Manhattan Project; and Emily Blunt brings both fragility  and strength as Oppenheimer’s put upon wife Kitty.  When Oppenheimer focuses on the witch hunt against  the famed scientist who was accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union, the  film shifts from a story about the fight within the soul of a man to the fight  for the soul of a nation, as swampy figures within US government bureaucracy  and intelligence conspire to drag Oppenheimer down into the thick stench of accusation  and character assassination. While much has been made about the frightening nature of Oppenheimer regarding the danger of nuclear war (and rightfully so), perhaps the biggest  takeaway from the film is how, almost 80 years later, duplicitous figures  within the US government still utilise the same old tricks to usurp their  enemies.  The technical craft in Oppenheimer is fantastic. Shot  on IMAX film, the photography by Hoyte Van Hoytema (Dunkirk) is  rich and dense; the sound design by Richard King (Inception) and  his team is an immersive sonic journey; and the editing by Jennifer Lame (Hereditary)  is a masterclass in non-linear structure. It all culminates in the Trinity Test – one of the best  sequences in a Nolan film – in which Oppenheimer and his team of scientists in  Los Alamos, New Mexico, undertake the first test of an atomic bomb they have  spent four years and $2 billion creating. The recreation of this significant moment  in science is as awe-inspiring as it is frightening. It is also a reminder of  how mankind, unfortunately, continuous to use its God given intelligence and ingenuity  to create weapons of mass destruction while lost in the fog of war. "
"Jul 29, 2023",positive," Oppenheimer, the latest from Christopher Nolan, is a searing portrait of a man plagued by visions of a world that can’t be seen, a theoretical world composed of the literal particles of his ideas. Driven by an unyielding need to bring his visions to light, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) struggles with the notion of bringing theory into practice, reminiscent of the very process of filmmaking. It’s a film about the creation of something not before seen and the consequences this entails. It’s set against the backdrop of Oppenheimer’s hearing to renew his security clearance and maintain his vocal political influence on the United States’s atomic policy, a semblance of control over the further development of the weapon he helped unleash. Oppenheimer maintains several states at once, shifting backward to Oppenheimer’s early education and to his involvement in the Manhattan Project and forward to the contentious Cabinet hearing of former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and friend-turned-antagonist Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Visually, it’s clear to see Nolan’s love of the physicality of film, of the process of transferring concepts to a physical medium, and using the physical medium to present those ideas to the world; Nolan uses the development of the Manhattan Project to symbolize his own efforts. We’re witness to jarring visions of the physical processes Oppenheimer sees in his head, images of chaotic motion of particles, unharnessed energy with the potential to create new worlds and destroy our current one. For a film framed around political proceedings, there’s very little interest in political analysis here. Communism is used as a backdrop, but ideology isn’t the focus, and Nolan spends little time delving into the brunt of the political conditions his characters advocate for. Narratively, it’s one of Nolan’s more straightforward efforts in recent years, which despite its linear shifts maintains a clear through line and focus. The ensemble cast puts in stunning performances led by Murphy and Downey, and Emily Blunt is compelling as the equally troubled Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. From the onset, Oppenheimer, in all its jarring imagery and sound, sears its way into the viewer’s brain. It’s an effectively devastating portrayal of the formulation of events that unleashed unprecedented destruction onto the world, the results of which we’re still caught in the looming shadow of today. R, 180 min. "
"Jul 29, 2023",negative," If you like film at all, you’ll no doubt be seeing Christopher Nolan’s epic three-hour biopic Oppenheimer. Considering the cinematic doldrums lately, why wouldn’t you go for this hugely hyped, wildly praised spectacle, which is bound to be given every known award? You’ll spend the hours studying legendary physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, in vast close-ups, especially if you see the film in IMAX, which makes Murphy’s face seem as tall as skyscrapers and his wide blue eyes as big as swimming pools. The attempt to understand “what made Oppenheimer tick” is as old as the A-bomb, and this film tackles it afresh, clearly with the assumption that it’ll all be news to the younger generation. If you’re already convinced of the dangers of nuclear war, superseded only by the ongoing end-times series of rolling climate catastrophes that now seem more likely to kill us all, this film is going to lack a certain urgency, however. Still, all of the Nolanisms beloved by his fans — who are legion after such career hits as The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk — are represented. Nolan’s traditional, emotionally melodramatic Hollywood movie tendencies are, as usual, dressed up in intricate flashbacks, narrative trickiness, pyrotechnic editing flourishes, and pounding soundtrack bombast. And because Nolan can now stack his casts with famous actors as yet another aspect of his sky-high production values, you’ll have the repeated experience of registering celebrity faces as characters are introduced. And so many characters get introduced, scenes sometimes play like handshaking parties. There’s Matt Damon as Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, who brought on Oppenheimer as the head of the secret mission to win World War II by creating an atomic bomb! There’s Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission! There’s Tom Conti as Albert Einstein! There’s Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr! There’s Benny Safdie as “father of the hydrogen bomb” Edward Teller! There’s Josh Hartnett . . . and Rami Malek . . . and Casey Affleck. I’m hinting in my subtle way that I don’t particularly like Christopher Nolan films in general, so that’s something to note as you read this review. I also don’t like this film in particular. But, of course, there are innumerable rave reviews of Oppenheimer, so mine stands as a rare dissenting opinion. The film is constructed in a way that suggests trying to pull together the fissured strands of Oppenheimer’s personality even while acknowledging that there’s no way to arrive at a sensemaking whole when contemplating his visionary brilliance, his vacillating politics, his turbulent love life, his triumph and tragedy as the “modern Prometheus,” and his interludes of swaggering hubris combined with his interludes of guilt-ridden reticence. Ultimately, Oppenheimer is treated as an oceanic mystery of a man raised to the sky in public opinion for (in the view of the majority) saving the Allies from the ongoing horrors of fascism and World War II, then cruelly pilloried on trumped-up anti-commie charges. But the real punishment is his awesome guilt in leading the effort to unleash the horrors of nuclear war upon us. Nolan deploys a Citizen Kane–like model of narrative fracturing to convey Oppenheimer’s dizzying complexity in the crucible in which he found himself. Orson Welles’s original title for Citizen Kane was “American,” and he makes Kane’s material circumstances a vital issue in his film. Born into the hardscrabble working class, he becomes incredibly wealthy overnight through access to vast American natural resources — in his case, literally striking it rich with the “Colorado Lode” mining bonanza. This makes possible his ascent to fame and “great man” status while hollowing him out at the same time, catastrophically cutting him off from his own family and community. Like Welles, Nolan embraces the idea of the final unknowability of the character. Early in Nolan’s film, for example, you see the incredible incident of the deadly poisoned apple that the resentful student Oppenheimer gives his professor. This turns out to be based on something that really happened while Oppenheimer was studying at the University of Cambridge. Nolan represents Oppenheimer with aching sympathy as a lonely boy genius, homesick and further isolated from his peers by his obsessive visions of structures underlying the teeming chaos that seems to make up the world. He’s shown to be pitifully self-conscious of his own incompetence in the lab, which doesn’t exactly match the real Oppenheimer’s superior tone in describing his Cambridge education to a friend: “I am having a pretty bad time. The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything. . . . The lectures are vile.” Nolan based his film on a Pulitzer Prize–winning biography that also regards Oppenheimer with tender pity, attributing his act of poisoning to his recurrent depression. “Robert did something so stupid that it seemed calculated to prove that his emotional distress was overwhelming him,” write the biographers Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin in American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. “Consumed by his feelings of inadequacy and intense jealousy, he ‘poisoned’ an apple with chemicals from the laboratory and left it on Blackett’s desk.” Oppenheimer injected an apple with some toxic substance that was perhaps not as lethal as the cyanide represented in the film, in which a remorseful Oppenheimer is portrayed as waking up in the morning, shocked at his own murderous act. He races back to the professor’s office to retrieve the apple from his desk. To his horror, one of his idols — Niels Bohr — is just about to take a bite out of the apple when Oppenheimer snatches it away, with the breathless explanation, “Wormhole!” That’s not actually what happened in real life. Accounts are a bit vague, but they agree that somehow Oppenheimer’s poisoned apple created no casualties but still got found out by the authorities at Cambridge. Oppenheimer’s father had to hurry to prevent young Oppie from being expelled, in part by guaranteeing his son’s regular visits to a psychiatrist. Not-so-young Oppenheimer went on to further acts of reckless hubris. According to a review of another recent Oppenheimer biography, “As a young professor in California, he crashed his car while racing a train, an accident that left his girlfriend unconscious. His father made amends by giving the young woman a painting and a Cézanne drawing.” Why not include Oppenheimer’s far more cinematic daredevil race against the train in this biopic? It’s every bit as telling of what comes later as the highly symbolic poisoned apple incident is. (Oppenheimer gave all of humanity a poisoned apple, but he failed to snatch it away again, see?) The “womanizing” Oppenheimer is shown to be an unintentional but nevertheless total disaster to the women in his life. Though, admittedly, he seems drawn to dark, depressive, humorless women who happen to be members or former members of the Communist Party. His longtime love, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) commits suicide when Oppenheimer ends their lengthy on-and-off affair. His long-suffering, alcoholic wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), is shown to be curdling into ever-angstier meanness during their marriage and repeatedly rejecting motherhood in the harshest way. But there’s no way to make the starker, weirder, more shockingly arrogant aspects of Oppenheimer’s personality conform to the portrait that Nolan’s building here. You’ll wait a long time for an American biopic to make a serious effort to tell the harsher truth. It’s a terrible genre for that reason. The more interesting, insightful aspects of famous lives are almost inevitably censored. Drawing on Cillian Murphy’s pitiful thinness — which he achieved through dramatic weight loss he could hardly afford — and the softer possibilities of his pink-mouthed, big-eyed face, Nolan presents us with a perpetually distracted, endearingly eccentric, brainy naif who gets carried away with his own visions and enthusiasms until it’s too late to reckon with the crushing consequences of what he’s done. There’s little sense, especially, of Oppenheimer’s well-known, towering ambition. It could certainly help account for some otherwise puzzling behaviors of his, such as his insistence on appearing before the kangaroo court assembled to remove his security clearance and tarnish his reputation in ways potentially fatal to his titanic career. This was well into the McCarthy era of blacklisting leftists for far less involvement in communist politics than Oppenheimer had, however scattershot his actual activities were. By 1954, the likely consequences were obvious. Einstein himself warned Oppenheimer against appearing, and then, when Oppenheimer refused to listen, dismissed him in a cutting remark to his assistant: “There goes a narr,” which is German for “fool.” Oppenheimer’s refusal to dodge the hearing is credited to his heartfelt patriotism, but surely his sense of self-importance and untouchability was a part of it too. As the film demonstrates, once on the receiving end of the commission’s attacks, Oppenheimer became soft and cagey in a way that infuriated his wife, who wanted him to put up a strong fight against the forces of American government behind the blacklist. Nolan represents this as a kind of “martyrdom of Saint Oppenheimer,” but a certain amount of crass careerism could’ve been portrayed as kicking in more overtly here, when his wife shrills, “Why won’t you fight?” After all, he had a lot to lose. As Nolan’s film demonstrates, postwar Oppenheimer was famous, considered the top scientist in America and maybe the world, celebrated on the cover of Time magazine. His conviction that he could help guide the government’s handling of nuclear weapons along more humanely concerned lines really did get him dismissed by Harry S. Truman as a “crybaby,” but the fact is, he was actually getting consulted by the president and every other important suit on down the line. Nolan’s is the kind of film that features an ahistorically dramatic line delivery and a pause for a shudder of horror from the audience when someone mentions the name of “Los Alamos,” the obscure desert location of Oppenheimer’s secret atomic bomb building and testing site. There’s exactly the same kind of ahistorical frisson in Gone With the Wind (1939), when Rhett Butler mentions the battle shaping up in a tiny Pennsylvania town that might decide the fate of the entire Civil War, called — weighty pause — “Gettysburg.” There’s also, more than once, the intoning of Oppenheimer’s own famously hammy quote from the Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita, in reaction to his work on the ultimate weapon of mass destruction: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.” In real life, Oppenheimer’s detractors noted that his pretentious quotes drawn from extensive if eclectic reading were among his more maddening rhetorical traits, but there can be no humorous eye-rolling at such pronouncements in this film. Which makes me appreciate even more the wild and funny “Barbenheimer” mash-up memes making the rounds about the incongruous yet oddly Cold War–compatible same-day opening of Barbie and Oppenheimer. My favorite one shows an eerie, distorted black-and-white image of the face of real-life Oppenheimer with the caption, “Now I am become Barbie girl, in Barbie worlds.” But the anxious would-be profundity in the handling of the film’s subject matter is part of the typical Nolan strategy of informing the world, and the members of the Academy and other award-giving entities, of the importance of his chosen subject. Nolan is making the press rounds saying that J. Robert Oppenheimer is “the most important person who ever lived,” so it logically follows that his film is crucial viewing and that all of his seriously considered directorial choices are also terribly important. Critics take down the information about these choices like publicists and report them faithfully to a duly impressed public — such as Nolan’s surprising decision not to show the Japanese victims of the atomic bombings. Instead, we see Oppenheimer merely imagining the effects of the bomb on members of his rapturous American audience. But the absolute lack of physical reality given to the results of dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki — the refusal to portray mass annihilation — is one of the film’s more stunning glossing-over effects. It’s ludicrous, the idea that Oppenheimer’s imaginings, safe in the United States, of the flayed skin of a few people in his audience who are applauding his speech, and a charred body impeding his path as he takes his triumphal march away from the podium, is somehow “more effective and chilling.” Not showing in any memorable or realistic way the ghastly consequences of Oppenheimer’s biggest achievement is a safe-playing strategy, once again, to preserve audience sympathy for the hero, which you generally need if you want a big blockbuster hit. And Christopher Nolan always wants a big blockbuster hit."
