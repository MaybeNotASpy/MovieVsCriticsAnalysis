"Apr 12, 2024",negative," Argylle comes home to Apple TV+ as one of 2024’s most embattled films. Reportedly acquired by Apple for $200 million, the film – the first in a hopeful trilogy from director Matthew Vaughn (the Kingsman franchise, Kick-Ass) – tanked at the box office and was on the sharp end of a whole lotta bad reviews. Its only saving grace may have been Madame Web stepping in a couple weeks later and inspiring an even greater vitriolic barrage. But is Argylle REALLY that bad? Or is it another case of hype eclipsing the truth? Let’s find out. The Gist: We meet Argylle (Henry Cavill) as he does what he does best: dancing with an attractive woman and shooting and car-chasing his way out of a scrape. His super-spy adventures aren’t really happening, and I don’t say that because the CGI looks so fake – no, this sequence illustrates what’s in the latest bestselling Argylle novel, written by Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard). She does a reading to her adoring fans then goes home to her Very Nice House, where she dotes on her cat, one of those designer felines with giant eyes and goofy little ears, and annoys us by talking to herself a lot while she writes the next book. She sends the draft to her mother (Catherine O’Hara), who gives her some notes, and has Elly hop the train to Chicago so they can work on rewriting that troublesome ending.  But what Elly doesn’t realize is, HER LIFE IS ABOUT TO CHANGE FOREVER. A scruffy longhair named Aidan (Sam Rockwell) plops next to her on the train and before you know it he’s saving Elly’s ass from a bunch of damn ruthless killers. See, Aidan is a spy, and he’s protecting her from a secret spy cadre who wants to murder her because her books have somehow been predicting the future of all this sub-societal skullduggery. And here we are, about 20 minutes into this thing, ready to punch this premise in the nose for being annoying, and for bringing us out of the movie because we’re wondering how they’re going to explain this. Further complicating things is how Elly looks at Rockwell-as-Aidan in action but sees the far more suave Cavill-as-Argylle doing all the fighting and shooting, prompting us to question her perception and our reality and wonder how we can escape being privy to this tortured concept. May I suggest turning it off and meditating in front of a blank screen? Alas, I cannot do that. Duty calls, so I dug in my heels and tried so very hard to care as Aidan and Elly go on the run to London and France and the Arabian Peninsula, getting into scrapes and navigating so many twists and double-crosses, the movie should be sponsored by Dramamine. We get scenes of bad guy leader Ritter (Bryan Cranston) screaming orders inside a Movie Command Center; drop-in roles from Dua Lipa, Ariana DeBose, John Cena, Sofia Boutella and Samuel L. Jackson; and a bunch of nice-elaborate-set-it’d-be-a-shame-if-it-got-all-shot-up moments. After a bit, you’ll realize this isn’t a Henry Cavill movie – he’s in maybe 15 percent of it – but a Bryce Dallas Howard/Sam Rockwell buddy movie in which the director repeatedly tries to upstage them with the CGI pet cat, who travels through this thing peering out of a backpack with a little window on it. I mean, Vaughn is REALLY enamored with the comedic potential of this cat, and less so for his stars, who might want to consider firing their agents after this one. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Sandra Bullock played a writer unwittingly swept up into ludicrous adventures in The Lost City, and it wasn’t particularly good, but it at least made sense and inspired a few honest laughs. Memorable Dialogue: We all shout AMEN when Aidan is debriefed on one of the plot’s stupid-ass twists and he replies, “That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard in my life!” Our Take: The difference between Madame Web’s badness and Argylle’s badness is significant: Madame Web was front-to-back incompetent while Argylle is visionary, with Vaughn leaning heavily into his distinct brand of virtuoso obnoxiousness. And as grating and loud as the last couple Kingsman movies were, Argylle takes it a step or three further, ratcheting up the spoofy goofing until the film becomes a mess of mealy satire, wrongheaded “comedy,” cartoonish action and a Samuel L. Jackson guru-monologue about grapes that’s supposed to be profoundly metaphorical but is the movie in microcosm: tedious, pointless and far, far too long. (That Vaughn intends to shoehorn Argylle into the Kingsman “cinematic universe” is enough to send one into furious conniptions, although the film underperformed to the point where any planned sequels are likely being tabled as we speak.) Although the actual budget of the film has been debated, it feels like blank-check filmmaking at its worst. Vaughn’s every indulgent whim seems to have been entertained. The CGI is rampant and chintzy, nobody bothered to edit the screenplay down to something coherent, a small legion of talented actors is asked to do borderline-embarrassing things and the overall tone is irritatingly self-satisfied. Vaughn concocts two third-act action sequences that are simultaneously original and godawful, showing us things we’ve never seen before and never want to see again, within a relentlessly artificial, antiseptic visual palette. It’s easy to get upset when lovable, talented actors like Rockwell and Howard are asked to do stupid things in the name of a misguided directorial vision. They’re stuck playing phony characters who apparently are designed to be plot devices in a grandiose satire of spy-movie tropes; why else would the plot deploy so many ludicrous twists that deem to separate us from being emotionally involved with these people? But it’s not particularly witty or observant, and it leaves us feeling bewildered, frustrated and bored. Argylle has the uneasy feel of a movie that seemed great in theory but just doesn’t work in execution. Despite his insistence on style style STYLE – albeit without the stylishness that would render it artful instead of egregious clowning – Vaughn’s go-to shot is of the cat, reacting as all cats do to nearly everything: withering ennui with a fringe of annoyance. At least we can relate to that feeling."
"Apr 12, 2024",positive," TV lovers seem to be eating good this month as SUGAR began its first season run over at AppleTV+ and both RIPLEY and FALLOUT have dropped their entire first seasons on Netflix and Amazon respectively. The raves keep coming in. So, why did I choose SUGAR to watch first (review below)? Because I was able to binge it via the press site. I no longer have an attention span that’s able to wait two months to finish a show while also watching close to forty movies and other shows concurrently. It’s too much information. So, the choice was more about beating the curve (watching the show that I can’t get spoiled on because no one else has watched it yet) than anything else. Now I can hopefully settle into one of the other two before my social media feeds run rampant with memes, clips, and impressions that I’ve trained my brain to mostly ignore. I take a mental snapshot of posts first and discern whether the title or an actor is included before deciding to actually read it. It’s served me well so far the past few years. A big TRUE DETECTIVE: NIGHT COUNTRY spoiler snuck through a few weeks ago, but not having context made me think it was a joke … until I arrived at the episode and discovered it was true. I’m thinking RIPLEY is next. Maybe I’ll do a rewatch of THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY first as it’s been over two decades since I’ve last seen it. I enjoyed that film, but never saw any of the other adaptations or read any of the books. I’m mostly just an Andrew Scott fan. And the same goes for FALLOUT. Never played the game. Have zero clue about what it’s about. But I love Walton Goggins and the tone seems like it should be a blast. I barely have time to watch these (I haven’t even begun SHOGUN yet since I’m waiting to binge it upon completion). So, how could I ever find more to engage with source material too?! For fifteen years, Paul (Nicolas Cage) has kept his sons safe. Unlike most parents, however, that job isn’t merely protecting them eating poison or running into traffic. No, Paul has raised his boys in a post-apocalyptic world wherein survival demands barricading oneself in for the night to avoid run-ins with violent creatures that hunt from dusk til dawn. Joseph (Jaeden Martell) and Thomas (Maxwell Jenkins) are now at an age where they can help their father secure the farmhouse they now call home … and unleash a rebellious independent streak that just might risk all of their lives. Screenwriter Michael Nilon and director Benjamin Brewer have a decent premise with ARCADIAN. Yes, it’s pretty much a less successful A QUIET PLACE rip-off that sacrifices our investment in the characters for our enjoyment of action set-pieces, but there’s still enough to grab onto so the ride doesn’t feel like a total superficial waste. After all, it’s tough to toe that line and even tougher to do it correctly with less than ninety-minutes of runway. Rather than spend time with Paul’s family, we’re meant to turn a prologue with him running to protect his twin babies beneath an underpass as all the love necessary for their present selves. While it’s enough to earn Paul’s call to action when Thomas doesn’t come home, the way his heroics play out is less about love than duty. He must protect them even if it means risking his own life. He’ll run out into the night and fend off as many beasts as he can to find his son and bring him back alive. We believe it because Paul is a stock character whose personality is “Dad.” Cage does his best to make it more, but he’s mostly just going through the determined motions of a man whose life is expendable when compared to his kids. It leads to some badass moments, but very little emotion. You could pretty much say that about the entire film. All the interesting bits (Joseph’s analytical brain creating traps to study the monsters teases some cool potential only to be usurped by a generic sibling squabble) serve the overall conceit—itself so by-the-numbers and direct that it almost buckles in on itself before it can even attempt to hold up any weight. Because ARCADIAN is all set-up. It’s an introduction to a world explained away by a children’s game “guessing” how the end of the world occurred, hoping we’ll stop wondering about the truth if we’re under the impression that the “truth” neither matters nor exists. In that regard, the film works. Martell, Jenkins, and Sadie Soverall (who plays Charlotte, Thomas’s crush who lives with her parents in a community that doesn’t trust Paul) carry the drama well as teens growing up fast and needing to implement everything their parents taught them on-the-fly to survive. And the monsters are effective if also super weird (gorilla-like in movement with a sock puppet head that claps obnoxiously fast at its jaw hinge before attacking with a goo sack that dissolves and absorbs its prey???). Their volatility match by humor when they latch together into a giant wheel rolling down the road. By the end, I found myself more excited about what’s next than what I just witnessed—the opposite of A QUIET PLACE. That one sets up a world through the eyes of a family while this sets up a family trapped inside a world. And while Nilon and Brewer think they’ve also done the former to make us care about Paul and company’s survival, I just saw that trio as ancillary to the unknown. They want us to enjoy the effects, action, and gore so much that they forgot to make the people engaged in those things more than two-dimensional stereotypes of a demanding father, good son (industrious), and bad son (romantic). An accident sparks a conflict, all hell breaks loose, the dust settles, and we go home. While ARGYLLE might be the dumbest of Matthew Vaughn's films, it still remains a lot of fun—something I cannot say for KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE (I didn't even bother with THE KING'S MAN). The cast is game, the music is good, and the action toes that line between exciting and farcical to keep the audience engaged even if the motives and plot are as simple as simple can be. Because while the premise is great (Jason Fuchs' creates a writer who writes her spy novels so well that real spies want to use her to help them solve a mystery eerily similar to her fiction), the almost two-and-a-half-hour runtime is mostly gags and redundancies attempting to trick us into thinking there's more than meets the eye. The MacGuffin isn't even nuclear codes or an apocalyptic virus. It's just a dossier of the bad guys because the good guys won't believe they exist without one. (So, just make one yourself since you already know all the information it contains?) I really liked the first fight scene with Bryce Dallas Howard's Elly constantly blinking between Henry Cavill's Argylle dispatching villains with a calm smile and Sam Rockwell's Wilde doing so with much less grace. Howard and Rockwell’s rapport is fun (every iteration since they shift between allies and enemies multiple times) and the driving force for the entire film considering the spy stuff is so one-dimensional beyond it's not so twisty twists. The supporting cast is great too whether large roles (Catherine O'Hara and Bryan Cranston) or small (John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson), but the special effects leave a lot to be desired. The climactic Snow Patrol battle (""Run"" as sung by Leona Lewis) is laughably bad—and not because of the over-the-top dance choreography. The whole thing is shrouded in colored smoke created by awful CGI both in its visual authenticity and ability to interact with the actors. Thankfully an oil spill scene proves a tad better even if its ice-skating finale is a literal cartoon. As for the final shot and that mid-credits sequence? Absurdly silly both in content and the intent to lazily retrofit this movie into a completely different franchise. I cannot tell if it's meant as a joke or truly a tease for more. The most precious thing Linda (Mélinée Leclerc) and her mother (Clotilde Hesme’s Paulette) have to remember her late father by is a green ring. It’s been years since his death and the young girl still tries to sneak into her mom’s room to wear it to school. On this day, however, Paulette is at the end of her rope. She orders Linda to put it away so they can leave. And when she returns home to find it missing, she assumes the girl stole it anyway. Angry that her daughter lied and misplaced the jewelry, Paulette takes her to her sister’s (Laetitia Dosch’s Astrid) as a punishment. Only upon returning does she discover Linda didn’t take it after all. Sébastien Laudenbach and Chiara Malta CHICKEN FOR LINDA! therefore truly begins with a display of mortifying guilt. Yes, there’s a prologue of Linda’s dad dying and an expository scene introducing the neighborhood and characters we’ll soon spend a wild day with, but it’s Paulette’s apology and promise to give Linda anything she wants as redress that sparks the ensuing adventure. Because while the girl’s request of chicken and peppers (her father’s famous dish) should be simple (besides the obvious emotions conjured), Paris happens to have begun a general strike shutting down all grocery stores. So, Paulette must improvise. What follows unfolds as one would assume before logical realism gets replacement by unbridled absurdity. There’s chicken theft. An unmonitored oven ready to burn down an apartment complex. A naked police officer. And a watermelon delivery driver (Patrick Pineau’s Jean-Michel) who might just save the day with a little romance … if he survives not having an EpiPen. Linda and her young friends soon hijack the narrative with a willingness to do anything and everything to make this dish while the adults find themselves running around, clueless about what to do. Half the time Jean-Michel’s mother is passed out and Astrid angrily binging candy. Beyond the humor and grounded fantasy (so many people would be dead if this were “real life”), though, is a heartfelt story about two women struggling to connect in the present because of their inability to talk about the past. Because Linda loving that ring as much as Paulette has nothing to do with the ring. All this girl wants is to remember a man she was too young to remember. And while everything could be solved with a good mother/daughter chat, a wholesome criminal romp has the potential to solidify their bond too. Because their undying love for Serge should be what gives them the strength to move forward together. It’s a wonderful message told with a bottomless wealth of entertainment and gorgeous animation. The latter consists of mostly simple line drawings filled with solid colors to differentiate characters (Linda is yellow, her friend green, the police blue, etc.). When the camera is pulled back, the people become circles of those colors with their figures centered in the middle. When the sun goes down everything switches to “night mode” with the line drawings becoming those colors so the black of their bodies can move against the black of the background. Add a couple songs making it a quasi-musical and CHICKEN FOR LINDA! proves a compact, lightning-paced and resonant lark. The film starts with a scene of a young woman (Ramesha Nawal’s Mariam) looking through the narrow crack of an opened door before it slams shut in her face. We know some sort of violence is occurring on the other side by the sounds and her expression—just not the who, what, or when of the event. We can infer it has something to do with her mother (Bakhtawar Mazhar’s Fariha) and grandfather since we cut to the latter’s funeral. Maybe she killed him. Maybe it was a scene from the past. Maybe there’s no connection beyond the reality of Pakistan’s widespread patriarchal oppression. Writer/director Zarrar Kahn supplies that ambiguity with intent as his film IN FLAMES continues through a series of examples depicting just how insidious this malignant force of societal regulation is to the culture, upbringing, and existence of women in the country. This is done overtly (a man throwing a brick through Mariam’s car window to try and grab her in the street or a man getting her attention before starting to masturbate in front of her) and subtly (Fariha not marrying her daughter off so she can finish her medical degree or Mariam’s hunch that her great uncle has only taken an interest in them because he wants to take everything his brother left them upon his death). It also arrives via hallucination and nightmare. Where the aforementioned examples give us the unfortunate truth of the gendered dynamic at play in Karachi, Kahn never forgets his opening and the trauma seeing such inferred abuse can inflict upon a viewer. The result is an uncertainty towards what we’re watching on-screen and whether it’s real or imagined. We see Mariam imagining white-eyed specters of men like her father in the distance before they disappear, so does that mean other figures are all in her head too? Maybe the masturbator was an illusion. Maybe the fear that comes from always being seen as someone who can be exploited and duped has turned paranoia into delusion. Except reality doesn’t lie. Kahn jams so many instances into the narrative that we know this paranoia—if it is paranoia—is justified. Even if something isn’t real, it doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened before or won’t happen later. It’s a survival mechanism to keep Mariam’s head on a swivel when Uncle Nasir (Adnan Shah) talks about documents that need to be signed or when Asad (Omar Javaid) invites her on a beach date. She must constantly weigh happiness against horror. Is her blossoming love for Asad worth the risk that he might be hiding his true nature? And if tragedy strikes, leaving her alone to answer accusatory questions by men who will never listen to what she is saying anyway, is it better to flee? That’s where IN FLAMES is most potent. The blurred line between morality and self-preservation. If you’re trapped in a system that treats you like the enemy, you must resign yourself to the fact that no one else will save you. You must save yourself even if it means exploiting the system exploiting you, committing a crime, or living with the ghosts of guilt and regret that result from refusing to become that ghost yourself. It leads to some powerful moments of psychological distress that Nawal performs to perfection as her Mariam attempts to traverse this landscape of lustful and entitled men. And it eventually gives Mazhar the spotlight to shine during the second half as her Fariha’s experience reminds her of her own power to seek justice outside the law. What starts as a familiar tale of young love in the shadows of a domineering mother who does not approve soon reveals itself to be the nightmarish effect of how the “rule” often prevents us from pursuing the “exceptions” because we cannot afford to be wrong. Fariha isn’t domineering. She merely knows what awaits her daughter in this city. And Mariam isn’t naive to want to feel the joy of Asad’s company even if it means doing so in secret and at risk of their lives. Generational trauma is on full display as these women seek to succeed within the parameters their oppressors have set while proving the lengths they’ll go to protect themselves and, ultimately, add to that heirloom of pain. Ray (John Magaro) suspects nothing. Literally. His wife (Megan Stevenson’s Stacy-Lynn) leaves almost every night without inviting him. His brother (Matthew Del Negro’s Junior) is constantly buying new and expense things despite saying their company doesn’t have the resources to give him a raise. Everyone he loves is screwing him and he’s too much of a pushover to even consider the truth let alone do something about it. If not for a joke of a private detective (Steve Zahn’s Skip) recognizing Stacy-Lynn while staking out someone else at a seedy motel, Ray would have simply continued sleepwalking through his life. Skip’s decision to be a Good Samaritan and provide Ray the unsolicited photos he took is the spark that gets Shane Atkinson’s LAROY, TEXAS going. And it’s truly as mind-boggling and funny a scenario as it sounds considering Ray has no clue who Skip is despite the latter believing they had a connection via school and his brother years prior. Ray wishes Skip would have just minded his own business and not told him. Not that he’s going to actually confront Stacy-Lynn about it. He’s too much of a coward for that. So, he buys a gun instead, hoping to kill himself in the motel parking lot before she exits her room. That’s when fate intervenes in the form of a bag of cash. You see, someone has hired a hitman (Dylan Baker’s Harry) to take out a lawyer so he can steal the quarter of a million dollars in his safe. Believing that Ray is the man he hired, Tiller (Brannon Cross) gives him the payment and address instead. And since Ray is at a crossroads of identity, he takes both to force himself to see what he’s really made of. Can he kill a man? Can he stand-up and honor his promise to get the money Stacy-Lynn needs to open a salon? Can he win her back? Cue the avalanche. While LAROY, TEXAS’s almost two-hour runtime is a lot and the pacing does tend to drag when the melodrama of a delusional man who still thinks he can put his life back together takes over, it does remain entertaining throughout. Credit Magaro and Zahn’s rapport for maintaining that interest because their odd couple pairing gets unhinged once they unintentionally fall into “good cop/bad cop” shenanigans. Stevenson and a supporting cast that includes Brad Leland and Darcy Shean shine in the over-the-top caricature nature of their performances and Baker really rounds everything out via a quietly menacing turn. And I must admit that I enjoyed Atkinson’s decision to never fully lean into the humor when fleshing out his conclusion. The film might not get as dark as it potentially should after a very effective prologue, but the bleak nature of the finale’s “justice” does what it can to provide closure for the characters and the tone. The comedy is mostly born from the actors and small-town buffoonery of their roles rather than the scenario itself anyway, so it’s nice that the cost of doing violent business stays as high as it must. The end result won’t necessary wow anyone or alter the genre, but it’s a worthwhile ride to take on a rainy day. The first two episodes of SUGAR are fantastic. Series creator Mark Protosevich is an obvious lover of film noir and he imbues his lead character John Sugar (Colin Farrell) with that same romantic affinity. This private detective is constantly thinking about movies to either help process his current predicament, enthrall his latest audience, or crack his next clue. So, not even Sugar’s inner monologue can conceal the excitement of discovering that his next client is Hollywood royalty in producer Jonathan Siegel (James Cromwell)—whose granddaughter (Sydney Chandler’s Olivia) has disappeared. It’s a cool premise with the enjoyable stylistic choice of splicing in scenes from classic cinema like THE THIRD MAN, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Sugar is as nerdy as any cinephile, gushing over his proximity to a legend and constantly trying to share his love for the medium (later regaling his doctor with a description of the chest cavity scene from THE THING). It’s an obsession that complements his more general eccentricities—including a level of empathy for the less fortunate so earnest that only a man of his physical prowess can get away with it. Because while Sugar doesn’t like to hurt people, he will. The noir beats, sweetly quiet performance from Farrell, and intrigue of the case make the show’s start utterly enthralling. The Hollywood types are pitch-perfect (Jonathan’s stature and respect from the world makes him a flawed figure at home, Dennis Boutsikaris as his son Bernie is a mediocre facsimile producing third rate titles while keeping his junkie daughter and spoiled son out of the tabloids, and said son David, played by Nate Corddry, is an entitled rich kid who never learned better yet doesn’t earn our sympathy to use it as an excuse). So, when Bernie and David actively try to sabotage Sugar via their indifference to Olivia’s plight, we wonder if they’re somehow involved. I love Sugar’s code of morality—a stark contrast to the Siegel clan—that goes further than just non-violence. He doesn’t merely seek to do no harm; he’ll go out of his way to fix the harm others have done. He always remembers the names of those who serve him, never pretends to be above another soul, and always pays his wealth (accrued from finding missing persons for powerful, often dangerous people) forward to those in need. It leads to some genuinely heartfelt exchanges and commendable acts. It’s no surprise everyone enjoys his company whether his equal or “the help” (besides Bernie and David, of course). Sugar has an easy charm and honest demeanor. He’s a protector through and through. And while he never wavers from this personality, the show does soon muddy that charm a bit by giving us a reason for why Sugar is the way he is. First it starts with the tease of a bigger conspiracy at play (one that forces us to question allegiances with people like Kirby Howell-Batiste’s, now credited simply as Kirby, handler Ruby) and then a full-blown table toss of a genre-bending reveal that can’t help overshadowing the simpler noir nature of the main plot. That’s not to say it doesn’t all work or that the explanations are convenient rather than relevant. Protosevich and his team know what they’re doing—it’s just a lot to process and a big shift in scope. It’s also completely unnecessary. This “twist” adds nothing to the whole beyond a reveal for viewers to talk about at the water cooler. Because it’s not a “twist” at all. It’s crucial information about Sugar and the world in which he lives that has simply been kept from us. I’d argue the show would prove much better if Protosevich led with this detail and let us enjoy the character choices through that motivation. If I watched the season again right now, knowing what I do, I’m almost one hundred percent certain I’ll enjoy it more because I won’t be forced to reconcile a rug pull that does more to halt momentum in its faux profundity than it does to add to it. By allowing me to engage with the smaller focus and truly cherish it as a salve to the very dark places this case goes only to then widen the aperture to the point where Olivia becomes a MacGuffin instead of the key to the puzzle, you ensure I’m kept at arm’s length. You have me feeling disappointed rather than energized—like the show bit off more than it could chew when it’s really the decision to hide context hamstringing the whole from just being allowed to be itself. I do therefore hope a second season is on the horizon, because I’d like to know where things go without any cheap narrative manipulations in a bid to trend on social media. Regardless, I still really enjoyed SUGAR and Farrell’s work within. Step back from that structural misstep and there’s a ton to like from the production value, classic cinema angle, and impressive cast. Amy Ryan steals the show for me as Melanie, the one member of the extended Siegel family with a heart, because she effortlessly matches Farrell’s performance beat for beat to foster a wonderful rapport and trust. Boutsikaris earns a memorable scene in the penultimate episode to steal some thunder for himself and the supporting cast that includes Anna Gunn, Eric Lange (playing a heavy with welcome humor), and Jason Butler Harner never falters. It’s truly a solid season of television with the potential to get even better. “Careful what you wish for because you just might get it” is the sentiment that carries through Ena Sendijarevic’s darkly funny SWEET DREAMS. The cause and effect at play on-screen is never quite what the characters anticipate or hope for when they willingly allow themselves to be put into exploitative situations that they believe they can turn the tables on. Siti (Hayati Azis) embraces the midnight advances of her sugar plantation’s Dutch owner (Hans Dagelet’s Jan) because having his child (Rio Kaj Den Haas’s Karel) means she’ll be untouchable in comparison to her fellow Indonesian laborers. Agathe (Renée Soutendijk) lets her husband die because removing him from the picture will provide retribution for his infidelities and, perhaps, more control over the operation. Cornelis (Florian Myjer) and Josefien (Lisa Zweerman) accept the former’s mother’s invitation to run the factory because being onsite should make it easier to sell everything off. The dominoes therefore fall right from the first frame with Jan teaching Karel how to shoot a tiger (and abuse the employees of which he resembles a lot more than his European father). Here’s an Indonesian boy being raised like he’s white whose father (the reason everyone allows it) suddenly dies. That leaves both wife and mistress in the lurch—although Agathe has the means to attempt solidifying power because of her position while Siti doesn’t quite know how much power she holds until the will is read. And oh, how sweet it is for Cornelis to discover his father considers the illegitimate brother he didn’t know existed to be his real son. What ensues can’t help being humorous because the ego and selfishness of the main characters demands we never get in their corner. We want them to fall on their faces and fail to achieve their goals. We want their preconceptions, prejudices, and fears to steer their actions towards self-destruction rather than salvation because they deserve it. Only Reza (Muhammad Khan) earns our empathy as a man perfectly positioned to understand the state of the world. He laughs at the Europeans. Mocks them to their faces and gets beat-up for the trouble. And all he wants is to take Siti and Karel somewhere else to be free. If only that’s what she truly wanted too instead of money and influence. We do have pity for these tragic souls, though. Pity for what money and status did to Cornelis and Josefien—stunting their humanity at birth. Pity for Siti only wanting what’s best for her child despite her admitting in not-so-many-words that having Karel was a means to secure what was best for her. And pity for Agathe considering she’s been stuck in a horrible marriage and hoped Jan’s death might bring her calm comfort in the volatile place she now calls home despite everyone telling her she must return for Europe before things get worse. We pity them because they lost themselves to a system that ensured their demise. This is colonialism and the horrible fingerprints left upon the conquered land and people by its hubris and totalitarian rule. How sweet it is then that the familial chaos of Jan’s death leads to financial chaos too once the scales tip via strikes and social unrest. Watching Cornelis and Josefien squirm is a delight because they know they need to sell now despite the means to be able to do so being too insidious even for them. How then will it all end? Will Reza find a way to save those worth saving? Will Siti get cajoled into helping this family to ultimately help herself? Or will all their lofty dreams turn into a fiery nightmare? This weekend sees BRICK LANE (2008), MAMA’S BOY (2007), SUPERHERO MOVIE (2008), THREE TO TANGO (1999), and WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER? (2008) getting added to the archive (cinematicfbombs.com on Sunday, Twitter on Monday). “This is a familiar film built upon true tales of survivors that borders on miserablism. It hits the right emotional notes, though. And it's impossible not to root for Sarr.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “The trauma Cea endures can no longer be brushed away with the ignorance of youth. She can't afford to forgive and forget. Not when she's always left picking up the pieces alone. The result is weightier than you might expect.” – Full thoughts at jaredmobarak.com. “The result isn't flashy or wholly unique beyond the content itself, but Winton's life is simply too compelling to not captivate regardless.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “Give Fessenden credit for really jam-packing this low-budget affair with as much political and social commentary as possible—even if a lot of it might come across as somewhat half-baked and reductive. The experience is worth those hiccups.” – Full thoughts at The Film Stage. “I personally would have liked it to go even further [stylistically], but I can't deny its cult-status appeal or its brilliant use of young performers who are rarely afforded the opportunity to shine quite like this.” – Full thoughts at HHYS."

Anyone familiar with Vaughn’s Kingsman shooting and aesthetic style will be in their comfort zone with Argylle ; manic action set-pieces, glitzy glamour mixing with a fish-out-of-water protagonist, patchy CGI and a cavalcade of colourful characters all make appearances.  The film’s biggest asset are the many twists and turns in the story. One or two you can see coming but there are a couple of genuine shockers that completely turn the movie on its head.  Dallas Howard is much more convincing as a timid writer than during other beats her character is given and it’s a wickedly entertaining Sam Rockwell ( Aidan Wilde ) who has the most fun.   A flat-topped Henry Cavill proves his Bond credentials as the embodiment of Elly’s literary hero, singer Dua Lipa ( Lagrange ) shows she may have a future in acting with an eye-catching small appearance and Bryan Cranston ( Director Ritter ) and Catherine O’Hara ( Ruth ) supply their trademark class.  Alfie the Cat really could have been a scene-stealer but too many of his hijinks are digitally rendered, and we spend too much time on the road with Elly and Aidan before getting to the heart of the movie’s matter.   The action highlight is a wonderful multi-colour smoke showdown set to Leona Lewis’ cover of Snow Patrol’s Run , while Aidan’s disposal of goons in a train carriage cleverly switches between Rockwell and Cavill from Elly’s point-of-view.  The ending and a mid-credits scene tease an exciting connection to, and future for, this planned trilogy, but I wonder if the cat has already been let out of the bag in terms of its best twists and surprises.

"Mar 27, 2024",negative," As a cartoonish riff on meta-fiction and absurdist action hijinks, Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle isn’t half-bad. It begins in spectacularly lousy fashion, though, with a calculated action sequence involving the titular British super-spy (Henry Cavill) and his partner and tech operator, Wyatt (John Cena), trying to get a Macguffin of some kind from a sultry counter-agent in gold lamé (Sofia Boutella) on a Greek island. The whole thing is calculated to feel contrived, mixing and matching tired James Bond cliches with over-the-top digital action that doesn’t even make sense within the world of 1’s and 0’s. But, then it is revealed that Argylle doesn’t really exist, but is actually the fictional creation of mega-best-selling author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), whose series of super-agent books currently numbers four and she is well on her way to finishing number five. But, something funny happens on the way to the final chapter, as the reclusive, introverted Elly gets shanghaied on a train trip to visit her mother (Catherine O’Hara) by a real-life spy (or so he says) named Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who informs her that her books bear a striking resemblance to real-life spy shenanigans, especially a super-secret organization headed by a man named Ritter (Bryan Cranston) who really, really wants her dead. So, in Romancing the Stone fashion, Elly finds herself drawn into a world of spy action that her books seem to have predicted (at a meet-the-author event, a fan asks if she is an actual spy like John Le Carré or Frederick Forsyth).  Bryce Dallas Howard, taking a break from the Jurassic World franchise, plays the incredulous straight woman with good spirit, and she is aided and abetted by the consistently amusing image of her carrying around her beloved cat, Alfie, in a plaid backpack with a bubble window that ensures the wide-eyed feline face plays for maximum comic effect. Elly’s created world and the real world constantly collide, as we see the absurdly square-coifed Argylle in action from time to time, reminding us that there is some kind of deeper link between what Elly types on her laptop and what actually unfolds in the clandestine spy world. There are questions within questions, and everything is eventually given some kind of answer, with the only one really left wanting is how John Cena could be wasted in such a minor role. Vaughn has in recent years dedicated almost all of his time to the ever-expanding Kingsman action movie series. Outside of his directorial debut, the gritty crime drama Layer Cake (2004), which starred a pre-007 Daniel Craig, I have never really taken to his hyperkinetic style, which is somehow overly slick and hammy at the same time. It worked well enough on the superhero parody Kick-Ass (2010), if only because the ridiculousness of the material matched Vaughn’s penchant for overkill. He dials things back a bit here, and some of the best moments are the screwball back-and-forth dialogue between Elly and Aidan, the latter of whom never seems entirely trustworthy (and at one point appears to be a secret enemy). Screenwriter Jason Fuchs (I Still See You) certainly knows his way around genre conventions and he has fun with expected twists and turns and revelations (including the timely appearance of Samuel L. Jackson), although it ultimately feels so airy and goofy that it loses it steam by the end.  James Kendrick offers, exclusively on Qnetwork, over 2,500 reviews on a wide range of films.

"Mar 24, 2024",negative," “Argylle” (2024) is about an unassuming author, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who writes spy novels about Agent Argyle (Henry Cavill) and is suffering from writer’s block as she approaches the book series’ end. Conway’s novels are renowned for correctly predicting future international events thus attracting unwanted attention from real-life spies, which is why rogue agent Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell) intervenes to protect her and her Scottish fold cat, Alfie (Chip) from the Division. Why is Conway so prophetic? With a runtime of two hours, nineteen minutes, avid moviegoers should be able to figure it out in the first five minutes, which makes the movie one hour sixteen minutes too long. The plot sounds reminiscent of Sandra Bullock’s “The Lost City” (2022), but I never got around to watching that flick. Writer Jason Fuchs’ claim to fame is creating the story behind “Wonder Woman” (2017), which was beloved, but far from perfect. Director Matthew Vaughn had more success with some nice independent films like “Layer Cake” (2004) starring a young Daniel Craig, “Stardust” (2007) an underrated fairy tale, which deserved more success and “Kick-Ass” (2010), a brutal reimagining of comic book movies before he settled into the commercial success, but artistically vacant “Kingsman” franchise, which vary widely in quality. After watching “Argylle,” you will wish that he continued building on the prequel, “The King’s Man” (2021), regardless of how disturbing of Vaughn’s alternate vision of historic world events are. All the characters in “Argylle” are archetypes, which explains why so much money seems to be sunk into the film so viewers will not notice how boring it is. Elly is a retiring homebody who prefers to cuddle with her cat and Facetime her mom than go out with a hot guy. During melees, in the blink of an eye, she sees Argylle, instead of Aidan, fighting. Howard did some of her best work in this film, but that is after being relegated to stinkers like the lesser works of Lars von Trier as a Nicole Kidman understudy in “Manderlay” (2005), M. Night Shyamalan in “The Village” (2004) or “Lady in the Water” (2006), and the “Jurassic World” franchise. When she is memorable, it is not work that one wants on their lifetime achievement montage: a random vampire Victoria in “The Twilight” series or a racist villain in “The Help” (2011). Being a nepo baby may pay the bills, but it does not feel rewarding if being a protagonist in a Vaughn film is the zenith of over two decades of work. It is nice to see Rockwell take a break from playing loveable racists: “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri” (2017), “Woman Walks Ahead” (2017), “The Best of Enemies” (2019). Aidan is a version of Rockwell from “Confessions of a Dangerous Mind” (2002): a wisecracking, dancing, irreverent version of a spy, rougher than the smooth talker British versions. Later in “Argylle,” he is a good sport for participating wholeheartedly in sly visual digs at his height in comparison to Howard, which makes him more affable. The charm meter is off the charts, and if the film works, it is only because Howard and Rockwell have chemistry as players in the fighters to lovers’ trope. “Argylle” is overflowing with talent. One standout is the delightful Catherine O’Hara as Elly’s mom. Bryan Cranstron plays a great villain as Director Ritter, but the casting may spoil the twist. Also it is unfortunate that his Conway novel equivalent, Director Fowler (Richard E. Grant), appears before Ritter because he is a born scene stealer and simmers as a more magnificent bastard than Ritter. I ended up wishing Grant had more screentime. On behalf of Cavill, may I plead with future filmmakers to stop messing with his hair: this buzz cut, his mustache in “Mission Impossible” Let the man be attractive! Ariana DeBose appears at bookends of the film as Keira, Argylle’s Q, and is so criminally underutilized probably because she was giving too much butch sexiness in the final scenes that everyone would have forgotten that she was not the star. Sofia Boutella as the Keeper of Secrets Saba Al-Badr was a waste. Boutella can fight so for a spy movie to just have her delivering lines should be illegal. Her chemistry with another spy was off the charts. “Argylle” was subconsciously a heavily queer movie and if its filmmakers were braver and less heteronormative, they could have embraced it and put a cheeky twist on the spy film as opposed to the dour, but gorgeous “Atomic Blonde” (2017). I preferred “Argylle” the first time that I saw it when it was called “A Long Kiss Goodnight” (1996) with a dash of “Keanu” (2016). Elly is Agent Rachel Kylle. When a mission goes wrong, she lost her memory, and the Division brainwashed her. She created Argylle in a subconscious attempt to remember who she was. Wyatt (John Cena)was Aidan’s fictional counterpart, and Aidan has been watching over her. I did not love the mixed visual metaphor that Argylle played in Elly’s real life. She disassociates and hallucinates because of the traumatic accident and brainwashing. She sees Aidan as Argylle, but when she looks in the mirror, she sees Argylle as her reflection. For the film’s premise to stick the landing, she should be seeing Cena in real life when she sees Aidan. The filmmakers made that creative choice because Argylle is the ideal, and they want the viewer to equate Aidan with Argylle’s mystique. It is a case of having one’s cake and eating it too. They want the big twist for Rachel to be the bad ass, but Fuchs and Vaughn are not great at relating to or writing women so their sympathy and admiration fall more easily on Aidan. In the denouement, the cliffhanger is whether Rachel will betray and kill Aidan. At their core, women cannot be fully trusted. Rachel and Aidan were allegedly in love yet in Elly’s books, Argylle is only attracted to women, and Wyatt is his business partner, i.e. there are no scenes where Argylle and Wyatt show any attraction. Let Cavill and Cena make out! They never do—sorry, which lends credence to the idea that Rachel was not into Aidan. There are two times when Elly tries to kill Kyle without any outside interference egging her on. In the train, during the first fight scene, she aims the gun at him. Then she throws the grenade at him in Bakunin’s hideout. I’m not saying that Rachel was not going to expose the Division. Her cat’s namesake is Alfred Solomon (Samuel L. Jackson), the former CIA deputy director. I just think that she was inclined to do it because of Keira. I’m not saying that they were an item, but they could have been. It felt as if Rachel and the Keeper of Secrets were an item. If “Argylle” had any redeeming factors, it was because Rachel was a badass when she finally appears, and it was nice to see a regular sized woman kick ass. Every Rachel fight scene was top notch, especially the combo of figure and speed skating on crude oil while bayoneting and slicing the bad guys. I loved the technicolor smoke grenade fight sequence, which is a convincing argument in favor of Rachel and Aidan being in love. It was very James Gunn-esque. Also just a superficial side note: I get the symbolism of hair color, but can movies stop with making the warm, nice character into redhead and the cold, calculating killer into a blonde. It is tiresome, and Howard looked better with red hair."

"Mar 14, 2024",negative," An action-packed self-aware spy spoof from Matthew Vaughn? Sign me up! Or so I, and perhaps you, thought. After directing the surprisingly funny and fresh Kingsman: The Secret Service, I was hopeful that Argylle would be a return to form with a similarly spy-tinged plot. Sadly for you, and star Bryce Dallas Howard, Argylle is a total bust. Howard stars as spy novelist Elly Conway who, having just completed the fourth book in her Argylle series, is about to wrap up the spy’s next outing. Needing some help with the ending of her next book, Elly packs her beloved cat into an argyle backpack and takes a train to her parent’s house after her mother (Catherine O’Hara) suggests a brainstorming session. On the train, she meets Aiden (Sam Rockwell), who claims to not only be a spy, but warns that a dark organization known as the Division has put a target on her after her novels uncannily predict real-world events in the espionage world. The film alternates between the imaginary world of Elly’s Argylle novels with the fantastical real-world events. Here, Henry Cavill (with a haircut reminiscent of Dolph Lundgren in Rocky III) stars in her daydreams as a super spy whose antics would make James Bond jealous. Aided by a crack team that includes John Cena and Ariana DeBose, Elly’s Argylle daydreams seem to mesh with her new real-world predicament, indicated through the obnoxious overuse of Elly’s point of view as shown through her blinking eyes. Cutting between Elly’s world and that of Agent Argylle at an exhaustingly frenetic pace, the film feels as though it was created as a marketing campaign built on flashy visuals. With brightly-colours and an over-reliance on CGI, Argylle wears its welcome out quickly. There is nothing of substance here and nothing for audiences to latch onto when what’s at stake seems to change at breakneck speed. Plot twists give viewers whiplash as we’re thrust from one ridiculous scenario to another. Elly’s real-world bears such little resemblance to our actual real world that tension never really builds into anything meaningful. Convoluted story threads eventually come together in a meaningless way as the film can’t pick a genre or tone and stick with it. Tropes are stretched far too thin in Jason Fuchs’ script that by the time the movie begins to embrace its absurdity in its third act, it’s far too late. As Aiden, Rockwell flits between Austin Powers-esque zaniness and 007 stoicism. And while it’s great to see Howard land a lead role, Conway is such a bland wet blanket built on hapless writer cliches that viewers have seen before. There was an opportunity here to send up these very cliches or turn a frenetically-paced spy movie into the new Bullet Train but Argylle drops the ball at every turn. It’s impossible to delve further into the many perplexing plot problems with Argylle without giving several plot twists away. Equally baffling is that for a film that changes track so quickly, the final product clocks in at an over-long 140 minutes. Don’t be fooled by the film’s poster or trailer which boasts a bevy of A-list stars like Cavill, Cena, and Dua Lipa. Their combined screen time amounts to less than five minutes of the film, while other stars including O’Hara and Bryan Cranston are underused. The story behind Argylle is only mildly more interesting. Perpetual rumours swirled that “Elly Conway”, the real mystery writer behind the actual book the movie is based on, is actually Taylor Swift. It’s utterly preposterous to believe that this pseudonym is anything other than a marketing ploy, and not even a clever one at that. And what of the marketing campaign’s real star, Conway’s beloved pet cat, Alfie? Alfie is played by Chip, director Vaughn and wife Claudia Schiffer’s cat. Yes, that’s right, Vaughn made an entire movie featuring his cat. The cat is only featured in a few scenes and the rest of the time is replaced with an awful CGI cat that is so distracting when on screen it’s impossible to look anywhere else when its weirdly rendered paws are on screen. (Seriously, I’ve seen many cat paws and that is not what they look like). All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men.

"Mar 11, 2024",negative," There's a current trend in new movies now showing in theaters, and it appears to be on the rise. Call these early 2024 releases supercute cinema. While awards-season heavy hitters continue to open in South Florida ahead of the 96th Academy Awards on Sunday, March 10, major studio offerings from the first several weeks of the new year have opted to double down on the silly. “Let there be levity,” these filmmakers proclaim. Following a fall and early winter filled with prestige biopics, sobering indie dramas and acclaimed European imports, this critic is all for this change of pace. A trio of new comedies run the gamut between teen angst fueled by macabre laughs, globe-trotting espionage with tongue placed firmly in cheek and a musical reimagining of a beloved high school satire from the mid-2000s. Good intentions, meet spotty execution. Let's dig in. “Lisa Frankenstein”: For her debut feature behind the camera, Zelda Williams, daughter of Robin, attempts to walk a tightrope between campy nostalgia-driven laughs and ghoulish romance. The filmmaker is intent on putting a smiley face on pretty disturbing subject matter, but the results come across as a jumble of underdeveloped ideas, a rough draft for a better film, especially to those who, like me, are totally on its happy-dark wavelength. It helps that Williams has entrusted screenwriting duties to Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning scribe behind “Juno,” “Young Adult” and the underappreciated “Jennifer's Body.” The movie starts, promisingly enough, with our sullen protagonist, Lisa Swallows (“Big Little Lies'” Kathryn Newton), fixated on a gifted 19th-century pianist who met an untimely demise and is buried in the abandoned Bachelors Grove Cemetery. It's not exactly a (fake) courtship, since love isn't really part of Lisa's current headspace, but her morbid interest certainly beats the dire situation that awaits her at home. The year is 1989, and Lisa's dad, Dale (Joe Chrest, essentially recycling his “Stranger Things” role), has remarried and moved in with his new wife, the selfish and materialistic Janet (a game but underused Carla Gugino) and her daughter Taffy (Liza Soberano), in Janet's thoroughly pink suburban abode. Where is Lisa's mom? Hacked up to pieces by a masked psycho who broke into their home, a piece of information that Taffy, Lisa's sole ally in this dysfunctional household, casually discloses to her classmates at school. The lingering trauma, coupled with Janet's open hostility, is too much for Lisa to bear. A fervent wish appears to align with a freak, green-hued thunderstorm that brings the long-dead musician from the dilapidated cemetery back to life. Sort of. What's Lisa to do when the lumbering, undead Creature (“Riverdale's” Cole Sprouse) who rose from his grave literally smashes into her home? A shower and a makeover, of course. Cue the fashion montage. The results play as if “Desperately Seeking Susan” director Susan Seidelman had remade Tim Burton's “Corpse Bride” with the genders reversed. It sounds amusing, but just when the movie should be kicking into gear, you realize it's running on fumes. The fun quickly turns murderous for the pair, as if “Heathers” had been reimagined as a “Goosebumps” episode, but Williams and Cody are unable to mesh the body count, and body horror elements, with their PG-13 rated sendup of teen comedies from the '80s. Also, while Newton shines whenever Lisa is rediscovering her confidence, it's too much of a stretch to buy her as a socially inept outsider. The filmmakers want to show you a good time, but they haven't really ironed out the story details beyond a grab bag of genre tropes and pop culture references. So what we're left with is '80s dress-up with a committed cast, occasionally clever production design and not much else going for it other than a winsome disposition. The period details alternate between lazy (Taffy's red Yugo) to on-point (Lisa's peachy keen wardrobe, including a T-shirt with the titular character of the comic strip “Cathy”). What's missing is more of a narrative glue holding these ideas together. “Lisa Frankenstein” serves up cotton candy. Thing is, I was really craving a strawberry milkshake.  “Mean Girls”: Speaking of pink, there's another teen comedy out there that leans heavily into nostalgia and is another feature directing debut. Tina Fey has resurrected her thoroughly quotable foray into high school cliques and backstabbing maneuvers, not only rebooting the 2004 hit for a new generation but integrating the songs from the Broadway musical based on the original film. If the resulting Frankenstein monster stitched together from all these sources is not quite the misfire some would have you believe, it still falls considerably short of the standard set by the older, Mark Waters-directed film, itself inspired by Rosalind Wiseman's self-help book “Queen Bees and Wannabes.” First, let's point out what works. Directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr., working from a screenplay by Fey, have ingeniously structured the film to make it unfold not unlike a theme park ride, beginning and ending with a garage jam session by supporting characters/narrators Damian (Tony nominee Jaquel Spivey) and Janis (“Moana's” Auli'i Cravalho). In other words, a film already brimming with queer appeal is frequently told from the point of view of the two queer characters. As for this “Mean Girls'” queen bee, the vicious Regina George, pop star Reneé Rapp capably takes over the part made iconic by Rachel McAdams. As for her ex-boyfriend, the dreamy Aaron Samuels, cutie patootie Christopher Briney is as good as, and even better looking than, the original Aaron, Jonathan Bennett. But, as in the 2004 movie, this remake/remix rises and falls by the ability of its lead actress to carry it, and this is where the new “Mean Girls” doesn't make fetch happen. On paper, Amy Adams look-alike Angourie Rice (HBO's “Mare of Easttown”) seems to be the perfect fit to breathe new life into Cady Heron, North Shore High School's newest student, memorably played by Lindsay Lohan. But Rice, wholesome but unremarkable, alternates between adequate and nondescript. It doesn't take long for the Australian actress to slide into blandness. It's a shame, because Cady, homeschooled and brainy, is an engaging character, and the contrast between her blank-slate naiveté and the rigid social rules practiced by the Plastics, the trio of popular girls who take her under their wing, is a combustible mix that draws blood in the original film. Alas, not so much in its 2024 incarnation, which amounts to a pale facsimile. What does it say about a movie that casts Jon Hamm as the gym teacher and sex-ed teacher, then gives him nothing to do? “Argylle”: With these two underachievers fumbling the ball, will director Matthew Vaughn come riding to the rescue? Don't count on it. The bad boy behind “Kingsman” and “Kick-Ass” has assembled a fearsome all-star cast, featuring the likes of Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara. But he has stuck them in an insouciant spy tale that's too convoluted, and not nearly ridiculous enough, to be much fun. If only Vaughn had bottled the cheerful absurdity of the film's opening sequence, “Argylle” would have easily been a gas. Picture this: a swanky nightclub, a vivacious Dua Lipa as a dangerous dame and Cavill as the titular secret agent, wowing the crowd with their outrageous dance moves. As Barry White's raspy vocals hit just the right kitschy note. A mission turns into an ambush, an ambush leads to a daring escape. And then we realize what we're seeing is the closing chapter in a book by best-selling novelist Elly Conway (Howard), who's out peddling her page-turner but is struggling to finish the next book, as she starts thinking the time is coming for her suave yet wooden leading man to hang up his hat. Ruth (O'Hara), Elly's mom/editor, is less than thrilled with the latest draft, so she suggests a visit home so they can brainstorm. Neither Elly nor Alfie, her fluffy, predominantly CGI kitty, make it home. Because on the train ride there, they comes face to face with actual spy Aidan Wilde (Rockwell), and Vaughn, working from an aggressively twisty screenplay by Jason Fuchs, reveals what appears to be the movie's central conceit: that a real-life version of the evil syndicate Elly depicts in her novels, led by the dastardly Director Ritter (Cranston), actually exists, and the events she conjures up on the page turn out to predict what actually transpires in the web of intrigue where she now finds herself tangled up. But as “Argylle” careens from competently staged fisticuffs to odd-couple banter between Elly and Aidan, the film moves farther and farther away from the freewheeling irreverence of its exhilarating beginning. The plot, rather than functioning as an engine to move things along, grows so elaborate that it takes about as long to explain what's going on than it does to take the movie from one setpiece to the next. It starts feeling like dead weight. When something like this happens to a movie that initially shows promise, I start looking for stuff on the edges, and “Argyle” does have a handful of incidental pleasures, like O'Hara's scenery chewing, Vaughn's tendency to shoot the fight sequences like musical numbers (coincidentally, one of his future projects is reportedly a musical scripted by “La La Land” auteur Damien Chazelle), and hottie Tomás Paredes punching above his weight as one of Ritter's henchmen. But these few bright spots only delay coming to terms with the sad reality that “Argylle,” while not nearly as lousy as you may have heard, squanders enough potential to fill a John le Carré novel. It jettisons its pleasures in favor of an endlessly mutating brick wall of a plot. The relentless rug pulling loses its capacity to excite or surprise. “Lisa Frankenstein,” “Mean Girls” and “Argylle” are now showing throughout South Florida in wide release, including at Regal South Beach, AMC Aventura, Silverspot Cinema in downtown Miami and CMX Brickell City Centre.

"Feb 27, 2024",neutral," Outsized, overdone and ill-conceived, Argylle takes what could have been a fun concept about mistaken identity amid hidden identity into a convoluted mess which consistently undercuts itself.  Is it a lighthearted spy film about James Bondian super-agent? A meta-fiction comedy about real life and fantasy becoming mixed together?  An action fable about both?  Yes, no, all of the above, none of the above … no one can decide or seems to want to decide leaving nothing but an incoherent blob which stays far past its welcome and can’t even make up its mind about an ending. The beginning is pretty solid.  Not the star-studded action set piece it wants everyone to think the story is, but the introduction to best-selling novelist Elly Conway (Howard), creator of the ubiquitous Agent Argylle. Despite being a notorious agoraphobe who never flies or travels without her cat, Alfie, and an overbearing, nit-picking mother (O’Hara) she has nourished a global fanbase waiting breathlessly for her next spy epic.  When some of those fans turn out to be real spies willing to kidnap Elly to discover the plot of her next novel which seem to predict real world events with great accuracy.  Her only hope against the sudden terrors she has spent her life protecting herself from is rambling, eccentric former agent Aidan (Rockwell) who needs what she knows as well. And if it just stopped there that would be fine.  Howard and Rockwell have strong chemistry and real comedic rapport.  When nefarious agents of the Directorate attempt to abduct Elly from a train, Aidan’s sudden rescue attempt becomes a ragtag ballet of misunderstanding, bullets and screams.  The more confusing the situation gets, and the more Elly attempts to escape, the better Argylle is.  If it stayed that way throughout, slowly seeking out clues amid confusion and repartee, that would be enough.  But no one knows to leave well enough alone. No sooner has Elly escaped one confusing situation than she finds herself in the middle of more double crosses, rescued by her own meddling parents (creating the brilliant paring of Cranston and O’Hara) and intermittently hallucinating her own creation (Cavill) trying to give her advice how to survive her increasingly dire situation.  It’s all a hat on top of a hat on top of a hat.  Vaughn seems to have no faith in how long any situation can keep his audience’s attention, preferring instead to keep whipping the story around into new directions and then doing so again just as we’re getting used to the new status quo.  It’s all built on the idea of reveal rather than revelation and forgets the law of diminishing returns. The idea of Howard in an action-comedy gunning down evil doers is a good one, but it’s so covered in meaningless twists and turns it loses its power and becomes a chore.  Eventually one that won’t end as ever more secrets are added on, even to the last moment.  No one seems to know what it should be so everything is thrown at the wall desperately hoping for the final form to spontaneously manifest itself.  It’s a waste of its main characters, it’s a waste of its imaginary characters and ultimately it’s a waste of our time."
"Feb 27, 2024",negative," There are a lot of questions swirling around the book “Argylle” and it’s creation. For starters, it’s first-time author Elly Conway is a mystery (with rumors continuing to swirl that she’s actually Taylor Swift). The story of its publication and how deeply connected it was to director Matthew Vaughn remains unknown, though within the first few minutes of watching the film version of “Argylle” it seems pretty clear that Vaughn had to be a key player in it being written in the first place. It’s one of the first truly bizarre elements in watching “Argylle,” which tells the story of mild-mannered author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), author of the book series on which the film is based. Elly is a loner who, in spite of her fame and success, enjoys spending her days living on the lake, working in her pajamas and being a cat mom to the darling Alfie. But while on a train to visit her parents Elly meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a spy who tells Elly the stories in her books are true and that people are trying to kill her.  To say anymore is truly difficult because of how many different turns “Argylle” takes in its nearly two-and-a-half hour runtime. The book version of “Argylle,” out now, actually has a plot focused on its titled character (played on-screen by Henry Cavill in a severe haircut), whereas this film only uses the character as a launchpad to showcase a fictional (?) version of Conway’s life. Howard is so charming and magnetic on-screen as Elly, a kindhearted, if very shy and anxious author who is so committed to her work she tells a handsome guy to sit in a different area of the train.  But once Elly meets Aidan the film turns into typical Vaughn-directed fare, albeit with a more subdued PG-13 rating. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry, particularly in the third act when Elly’s backstory is properly revealed. The pair dance and fight, with one needle drop — to Leona Lewis’ version of “Run” — easily making its way into this writer’s best moments of 2024. Howard, especially, gets to have a strong leading role as the movie goes on, with numerous opportunities for both comedy and drama. It’s almost enough to make you forget that Cavill himself is on the poster of this movie as the lead. Outside of Rockwell, Howard, Bryan Cranston and Catherine O’Hara (as Elly’s parents), the other A-list actors are given only a few brief scenes. Cavill, John Cena and Ariana DeBose open the film as the characters Elly writes about, but are as flat as they are on the page. Cavill, though, at least has fun with the character. Throughout the film Elly sees Argylle in moments where Aidan is fighting in a fun expectation vs. reality twist (where Aidan is sweating and being thrown around Argylle is fixing his hair and acting like Bond).  Though as the film goes on — with a runtime that feels at least 30 minutes too long — Cavill goes away leaving Howard and Rockwell to go on a series of globe-hopping adventures to find a shadowy Master Key, containing the agents of an equally shadowy rogue entity known as the Directorate. There are several needless moments of who’s zooming who that gets repetitive but, again, it’s great to see Howard get a meaty leading role even if she spends the first half whining and crying.  “Argylle” though is just too convoluted for its own good. In order to avoid backing itself into a corner the second half of the movie takes a sharp turn by explaining something about Elly’s past that undoes everything. If Elly has such a dark history how did she obtain a five-book deal with a publisher? Especially if what she knows is so dangerous? Why allow her to become a huge star with a massive social media following — that is only used as a god’s machine to find her in certain instances? There are also far too many scenes of Elly switching allegiances, some based on miscommunications and others based on contrived plot devices. And the assumption that this is part one of a series of films seems a tad confusing. Is this a series of Argylle adventures? The adventures of Elly Conway? Some hodgepodge of both? Because if this film is a proof of concept, the Argylle conceit has more possibility than Elly’s story, no matter how good Howard is in the role.  “Argylle” is fun in spurts with a strong cast of characters that help you get through the overly exaggerated runtime. But the script boxes itself into a corner too often and falls into repetition. Howard and Rockwell have fun, but they carry the movie leaving little meat to work with for future adventures. "
"Feb 26, 2024",positive," Matthew Vaughn’s latest action comedy follows Bryce Dallas Howard’s Elly Conway, a writer who found success with her Argylle novels. Her five books detail the titular Agent Argylle’s search for a very important master file and the book’s scenes come to life on screen with Henry Cavill playing the dashing Agent Argylle.  But – plot! – when Elly’s books start to mimic real life a bit too closely, Sam Rockwell’s slightly less-dashing agent comes to the rescue and sweeps Elly and her cat Alfie on a globe-trotting adventure that keeps getting more and more ridiculous. From the off, there is a boldness to Vaughn’s film. A boldness to be silly, unserious and most importantly, dumb. Argylle, more than anything, is peculiarly, endearingly stupid, in good and bad ways. That said, the biggest mistake Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs make is to assume their audience isn’t able to figure out the twists and turns of the story, approximately 35 minutes before they happen.  Argylle seems to want to be a film that is able to pull the rug from under you several times during its bloated, unnecessary 139 minute runtime. None of the surprises feel that surprising; Vaughn handles them all with a heavy hand and too many visual clues. Argylle is the cinematic equivalent of being hit in the head with a hammer. Then someone checking you’re okay. Then hitting you again.  Thankfully, Vaughn’s cast is very much in on the joke. Sam Rockwell is great fun as Aidan, the spy who swoops in to save Elly as a bunch of bad guys try to kill her on a train. Bryan Cranston is always dead good as a villain and Henry Cavill, a very underrated comedic actor, proves that he would have made an excellent James Bond.  Yet, Argylle is, supposedly, Elly’s story. Unfortunately though, Howard isn’t awarded much to do or to work with. While some of it is by design, Elly is such a blank canvas of a character that it’s near impossible to be attached to her. All of the film’s female characters (there’s five in total) either have only a couple of minutes of screentime or are reduced to damsels in distress.  Howard is a sympathetic lead, but the problem lies to my eyes within the script. Argylle is largely marketed as a Henry Cavill vehicle, even though the Man Of Steel actor plays a supporting character. Yet this is very much Elly’s story of finding her own courage and breaking free from her timid, anxious personality and embracing her role in this massive espionage conspiracy.  Argylle has an awful lot of plot, but very little story. The universe never feels properly lived in and the characters lack a lot of history. Argylle is much like Christopher Nolan’s Tenet; both films were forced to constantly explain what was happening to the audience, because there was more plot than the respective directors knew what to do with.  Like Tenet represented Christopher Nolan at both his worst and his most ambitious, Argylle is a bit of an enigma for Vaughn. The film, directed with maximalism by Vaughn, includes some of his worst instincts as well as his best. Argylle has a frustratingly formulaic plot and thin characters, but there’s also excellent fight choreography and a riotously fun dream ballet of violence. Argylle, clearly designed for the sanitised masses, also suffers greatly from the lack of gore; in fact, it’s a completely bloodless, and thus toothless, affair.  There’s a great film somewhere in Argylle, but on this occasion, Vaughn hasn’t been able to draw it out. It’s a chaotic thrill ride, with truly terrible CGI, that gets exceedingly dumb as our patience wears thin. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a good time.

"Feb 24, 2024",positive,Goes overboard towards the end but it is a fun trip up till then.
"Feb 23, 2024",negative," A certain subsection of Taylor Swift fans spent this past January advancing the theory that she had written the script for Argylle. There’s some reason to think this — Apple Films drummed up publicity for the movie this past fall by publishing  a real novel under the name of its main character, Elly Conway, and created some fake social media profiles for her. When the trailer went public, fans noted the resemblance between the short red hairdo on Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and the wig that Swift wore in  her “All Too Well” video. Swift does have a (pretty funny) history of working under pseudonyms, and she resembles Elly in being a devoted cat owner. All this was enough for some people, but I never believed it, just as I never believed the NFL rigged the Super Bowl for Swift, or that she was secretly gay, or that Paul McCartney has been dead for 50 years, or that Stevie Wonder has been able to see this whole time. If I do find out that I’m wrong and she wrote this, I’ll be very disappointed, because this comic spy thriller is tedious and a lot less clever than it thinks it is. Elly lives quietly with her cat in a cabin in Colorado where she writes a successful series of spy novels about the dashing Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill), who repeatedly saves the world from mad scientists and nefarious billionaires. While she’s traveling by train to visit her mother (Catherine O’Hara), a stranger named Aiden Wilde (Sam Rockwell) comes up to her dressed like a homeless man, identifies himself as a spy, and proves it by killing an autograph seeker along with a bunch of other armed people on the train who are evidently after her. The first sign that all isn’t as it seems is during the fight, when Elly keeps hallucinating Argylle doing the fighting instead of Aidan. The film starts promisingly enough, with Aidan pulling a terrified Elly through the streets of London to a villa in the south of France while she demands to know why they’re being shot at. The problem is that director Matthew Vaughn and actual screenwriter Jason Fuchs — he also portrays the moderator at one of Elly’s book signings — are too much in love with their plot revelations. Elly’s entire life turns out to be a lie, a plot devised by the former CIA director (Bryan Cranston) who’s employing one or more of her allies and may be a pawn himself. Argylle also continues to appear to Elly to give her advice on how to get out of her jam. A spy named Keira (Ariana DeBose) is a character in Elly’s novels but then turns up in her real life as well. Then comes the point when Aidan, without warning, throws a punch at Elly’s face, and she’s more surprised than anyone when she sidesteps the blow and judo-flips him over her shoulder. Some fans are touting this as a new meta way of telling a story, yet I kept feeling touches derivative of better spy movies before this. Vaughn has shown the abilities to be darkly funny and orchestrate an action sequence, but here the mix is entirely off. The comedy intrudes when the movie needs gravity, and the movie takes itself too seriously when it needs to be funny. The climax just piles set piece on top of set piece, and while some of them might have had an impact in a more judicious movie, they add up to too much of the same thing here. The supporting cast is stacked — John Cena as Argylle’s tech guy, Dua Lipa as a femme fatale, Samuel L. Jackson and Sofia Boutella as people who know Argylle’s real identity — but the movie makes poor use of all this star power. Even the great Rockwell is off his game, which is how you know it’s all gone very wrong. On paper, this film probably looked like a blast of thrills and meta comedy, but on the screen, it fails comprehensively on every score."
"Feb 22, 2024",neutral," Bear with me on this one. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elly Conway, a successful author whose espionage series Argylle has captured the imagination of America. In the book series, Agent Argylle and his partner Wyatt — played by Henry Cavill and John Cena, respectively, in dramatizations of Elly's novels — are on a spy mission to track down a “Masterkey” (we're getting lazy with the MacGuffin naming, eh?) to expose ""The Division,"" the de facto bad guy organization that does non-descript bad guy things. As Elly struggles with writer's block to complete the fifth book, she takes a train to see her parents and meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a good guy spy in the real world, who informs her that her books have inexplicably mirrored actual events. The good guy spies and the Division have been tracking Elly down to find out how Agent Argylle's mission concludes and therefore, how their mission concludes. The entirety of the movie plays out like a bad spy novel, from the dialogue to the fight scenes to the mugging for the camera, with director Matthew Vaughn and writer Jason Fuchs (presumably) taking the piss out of the genre — and, to their credit, a lot of the stupidity of the premise is explained in a decently fun way. There's no question that Vaughn understands the genre and can create a properly entertaining spy movie. Amusingly, his actual abilities as a filmmaker inhibit his ability to make Argylle what it so desperately tries to be: an unserious romp. Stupid movies are a grand cinematic tradition. Some of the most enduring and endearing stupid films drown themselves in brilliant stupidity, but to do so requires careful crafting and ingenuity. Argylle rests on a B+ movie idea that requires so much set-up and explanation, it muddles the stupid. For two hours, we agonizingly try to parse through the drivel and the competent. Internal pleadings for the film to mercifully end go unanswered, and another pointless sequence begins. By the time we reach the film's ridiculous conclusion, little fun is to be had and patience is incredibly thin. Not for nothing, the entire ensemble knows exactly what kind of film they're in and go for broke playing up their stereotypes; it almost makes matters worse how talented the cast is, given what a fruitless endeavour Vaughn tasks them with. Howard, Rockwell, Cranston, O'Hara and Cavill approach the film with a broad simplicity that Vaughn lacks and the movie sorely needs. What made the Kingsman films (the first one in particular) so successful was Vaughn's unwavering commitment to the bit, and perhaps Argylle could've come out on top had he done the same here. Commit to the stupid."
"Feb 20, 2024",negative," Este es una semana curiosa en términos de cartelera, ya que, al menos en Los Ángeles, se estrenan finalmente dos cintas de prestigio que buscaban insertarse en las nominaciones de los Premios de la Academia pero que no lograron hacerlo, pese a la calidad que tienen. Pero no estamos tampoco ante un fin de semana completamente cinéfilo, como lo demuestra la irrupción de una producción estrictamente comercial que promete llenar las butacas y que, de hecho, es la que da inicio a nuestro recuento. La primera escena de “Argylle” captura de inmediato la atención. Incluye un baile realmente sensual entre Henry Cavill y Dua Lupa, una persecución automovilística imposible pero ciertamente estimulante e intervenciones inesperadas de viejos conocidos nuestros como Ariana DeBose y John Cena. Después de esto, uno no puede dejar de pensar lo que hará Matthew Vaughn para mantener la valla tan alta y no agotarnos en el camino. Y aunque el director de “X-Men: First Class” (2011) y “Kingsman: The Secret Service” (2014) se las ingenia para entretenernos y desarrollar constantemente espectaculares escenas de acción llenas de coreografías vistosas, su obsesión por impactarnos con proezas visuales mientras maneja un guión de una superficialidad desconcertante termina por perjudicar a una cinta que no debió exceder la hora y media de duración, pero que se extiende por casi 50 minutos adicionales y que, en su parte final, se vuelve extremadamente disparatada. Tras la primera acción descrita, se nos permite saber que esta no sucedió en “la realidad”, sino que es parte de una de las populares novelas sobre un espía secreto (Argylle, por supuesto) que ha sido escrita por la creadora de ‘best sellers’ Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard). Sin embargo, las curiosas coincidencias entre las situaciones presentadas en estos libros y las acciones auténticas de grandes organizaciones criminales hacen que la escritora se convierta de repente en blanco de estos mismos delincuentes. Lo que inició como un día más de trabajo para Dua Lipa, se convirtió en un momento incómodo para la superestrella británica, luego de que varias fans se le aventaran y quisieran agarrarla durante su visita a la Ciudad de México, la noche del sábado.  Rescatada a último minuto por el espía Aidan (Sam Rockwell), quien no luce para nada como el Argylle de su imaginación, la protagonista se ve enfrentada a los ataques de un grupo liderado por el mafioso Ritter, quien es convenientemente interpretado por Bryan Cranston, el inolvidable protagonista de “Breaking Bad” (así como un villano de consideración por donde se lo vea). Apreciar a todos estos astros de la actuación durante una misma visita a las salas de cine produce indudablemente satisfacción (Howard es particularmente adorable); pero era razonable esperar mucho más de una megaproducción de 200 millones de dólares que, además de lo dicho, se ve excesivamente condicionada por el uso de CGI, sobre todo en las secuencias que involucran a la publicitada mascota felina de la novelista. Para finalizar, hay un detalle en particular que me quita completamente las ganas de alabar a “Argylle”, y es el uso continuo que hace de “Now and Then”, la “nueva” canción de los Beatles, incluso en momentos absolutamente desacertados. Ya no podré escuchar ese tema musical como lo hacía antes. ¿Se encuentran tan necesitados Paul y Ringo? La apuesta latinoamericana más fuerte para la ceremonia del Óscar que se aproxima, y que representaba a México en la categoría de Mejor Película Internacional, no logró superar la valla de la ‘lista corta’ en la que se la incluyó y no obtuvo por lo tanto la codiciada nominación. Pero eso no le quita ni una pizca de valor a “Tótem”, que se estrena este viernes de manera limitada en Los Ángeles luego de haberse lanzado una semana antes en Nueva York. Estamos ante el segundo largometraje de ficción de Lila Avilés, la notable realizadora capitalina que llamó ya la atención de los cinéfilos del mundo entero con su ópera prima “La camarista” (“The Chambermaid”), un retrato sobrio y a la vez intenso de las vivencias de una empleada de hotel en Ciudad de México. En ese sentido, “Totem”, que se basa en experiencias de la cineasta, amplía definitivamente el panorama en lo que respecta a sus personajes y hasta a sus ambientes, pese a que se desarrolla completamente en una casa pequeña perteneciente a una familia de clase media y a que mantiene por todo lo alto su carácter ‘indie’. El centro de la historia se encuentra en Sol (Naíma Sentíes), una niña de 7 años que se enfrenta a la enfermedad terminal de su padre, con el que no vive, y que asiste a una reunión familiar supuestamente dedicada a celebrar el cumpleaños del aludido, pero que tiene más bien sabor a despedida. Pese a lo dicho, la película opta por una mirada coral que, en lugar de generar confusión, nos permite conocer de cerca a los diferentes personajes que pertenecen a la atribulada familia. “Tótem”, que se encuentra mayormente filmada con camara en mano, no es una película que busque impactar de manera inmediata con su puesta en escena (pero fíjense en el modo en que retrata a los insectos y a las plantas) o que busque manipular a su audiencia (pero dinos si no te inmutaste al verla); de hecho, no cuenta con una banda sonora. Sin embargo, esto es justamente lo que convence más de su propuesta, y lo que ratifica a Avilés como una gran creadora (y recreadora) de situaciones realistas que no tiene que recurrir a artificios para conmover al espectador. Al igual que “Tótem”, la cinta mexicana de la que hablamos arriba, “The Promised Land” buscaba una nominación al Oscar en la categoría de Mejor Película Internacional que no consiguió, esta vez en representación de Dinamarca. Y al igual que aquel filme latinoamericano, se trata un trabajo de primer nivel que, en desmedro de la falta de inclusión en la lista final de la Academia, no debe pasar desapercibido. El excelente Mads Mikkelsen (“The Hunt”) le da vida a Ludvig Kahlen, un capitán retirado del ejército que, en 1755, logra arrancarle a los subordinados directos del rey el permiso necesario para tratar de convertir en tierra de cultivo una inhóspita región en la que se la ha asignado una vivienda. Una vez allí, se enfrentará no solo a lo que luce ante los ojos de todo el mundo como una misión imposible debido a la hostilidad del terreno y la presencia de poblaciones indígenas supuestamente agresivas, sino también a un enemigo completamente imprevisto y mucho más preocupante. Y es que la conciencia de la película (que se encuentra en el lugar correcto) no apunta a desvirtuar las posibilidades que ofrece la Naturaleza ni a denigrar a las poblaciones originarias, sino que muestra desde el inicio la codicia, la indiferencia y hasta la maldad abierta que manejan las clases dirigentes. De ese modo, Kahlen no es solo tratado por sus superiores con un desprecio inocultable debido a sus orígenes humildes, sino que, una vez en el llano, ve sus esfuerzos constantemente perjudicados por Frederik de Schinkel (Simon Bennebjerg), un noble despiadado que cree ser dueño de todos los territorios que lo rodean. Nikolaj Arcel, quien dirigió la celebrada “A Royal Affair” (2012), maneja la puesta en escena con solvencia y toques de maestría, y Mikkelsen está excelente, como casi siempre. El único problema por aquí es que el conjunto termina sintiéndose un tanto didáctico e inclinado hacia un estilo narrativo de simpleza hollywoodense, lo que no le quita poder a un filme que merece definitivamente verse pero cuyo villano principal, por ejemplo, resulta demasiado caricaturesco, más allá de que lo que se cuenta esté basado en hechos reales. Armado de abundante material de archivo tanto propio como ajeno, y respaldado además por algunas dramatizaciones y escenas con guión, Kleber Mendonça Filho recupera momentos esenciales de su formación artística y del desarrollo de su oficio en “Pictures of Ghosts” (“Retratos fantasmas”), que se estrena este viernes en el Laemmle Glendale, una semana después de su lanzamiento en Film At Lincoln Center de Nueva York. Pero lo más importante de cara a los espectadores es el modo en que el aclamado director de “Bacurau” (2019) nos lleva a descubrir un lugar que pocos conocemos y que, luego de ver este excelente trabajo de técnica mixta, nos resulta mucho más cercano. Estamos hablando de Recife, una de las ciudades más grandes de Brasil, ubicada al lado del mar y cuna del mismo Mendonça Filho, quien recupera imágenes del pasado para colocarnos en medio de la casa familiar donde hizo sus primeros cortometrajes, llevarnos al cine donde empezó a trabajar (y presentarnos allí a un inolvidable proyeccionista) y, finalmente, hacer un emotivo recorrido de las salas del centro donde se formó como espectador y que, si bien han desaparecido o caído en desgracia en los últimos años, fueron en sus mejores momentos una suerte de palacios de prestigio internacional. Pese a ser una cinta de profundo sabor regional, “Pictures of Ghosts” (“Retratos Fantasmas”) se esmera también en mostrar incidencias de una época gloriosa que encontraba las calles de Recife visitadas por leyendas de Hollywood -como Janet Leigh y Tony Curtis- y sus edificios poblados por delegaciones pertenecientes a los estudios de cine más poderosos de los Estados Unidos, los mismos que echaban a veces a la basura valiosos materiales de sus películas que terminaban siendo ofertados por vendedores ambulantes. Visualmente, la agilidad de la película y el sentido constante de la sorpresa que este tiene depende en gran medida del rechazo al uso masivo de imágenes estáticas y su predilección por unas tomas en movimiento que, además de otorgarle dinamismo y un incuestionable sentido fílmico a todo lo que vemos, resultan fundamentales para defender la teoría principal que se maneja: el cine es la mejor manera de traer el pasado al presente y, por lo tanto, de recrear ante nosotros lo que ya no existe, aunque eso implique convocar a los fantasmas. Las experiencias que atraviesa una mujer soltera que no se encuentra lista para tener hijos pese a que todas sus amigas se encuentran ya en esa etapa adopta una perspectiva inusualmente novedosa en “Scrambled”, una encantadora comedia dramática que se estrena este fin de semana y cuyas credenciales independientes no deberían ser un obstáculo para darle posibilidades de conexión con los gustos de las grandes audiencias. Claro que, sin dejar de lado el tono de comedia que se podría esperar en una película hollywoodense que se encargue del tema, “Scrambled” asume la tarea sin rechazar la idea de la maternidad, pero sin tratar tampoco de forzar a su protagonista a aceptarla tras descubrir al amor de su vida o algo semejante. Lo hace, además, presentándonos a una protagonista inusual en esta clase de proyectos: Nellie Robinson (Leah McKendrick), una mujer de 34 años que se comporta como una jovencita y que responde sin problemas al criterio de ‘girl next door’. Lo interesante por aquí es que McKendrick no es solo la estrella, sino también la directora y la guionista de una cinta que, como nos enteramos ahora, se encuentra basada en sus propias experiencias con el método de congelación de óvulos, que puede ayudar sin duda a las mujeres que no se encuentran listas para ser madres y cuyo reloj biológico empieza a complicar las cosas, pero que resulta por otro costoso y complejo. McKendrick no intenta que Nelly (su alter ego, asumimos) sea inmediatamente simpática o razonable, lo que puede incomodar a algunos espectadores pero le otorga un bienvenido sentido del realismo a una película que, de todos modos, comienza a coquetear innecesariamente con las fórmulas en su segunda parte. Sea como sea, se trata de un trabajo que vale la pena ver, incluso si lo haces únicamente para descubrir a la mujer que, por alguna razón de peso, acaba de ser elegida por Hollywood para escribir una nueva secuela del recordado ‘slasher’ “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (1997).

"Feb 20, 2024",positive," The movie is about taking down an evil organization bent on taking over the world (through violent means), but, in the long run, it's hard to say that the movie has any deeper meaning. Elly starts out somewhat helpless but eventually finds her strength and her agency. But even the heroes, including Elly, are spies who ""lie and kill people."" Of the nine most prominent/familiar actors in the cast, one is a Black man (Samuel L. Jackson), one is a woman of Puerto Rican and African American descent (Ariana DeBose), one is an English and Albanian woman (Dua Lipa), two are White women (Bryce Dallas Howard and Catherine O'Hara), and the other four are White men. The main character is Howard's Elly Conway, who's slightly bigger than most ultrathin female action heroes. Elly starts out somewhat helpless but eventually finds her strength and her agency and is able to save the day. Lots of peril, martial arts fighting, shooting, and explosions, but very little blood or injury shown. Fights with knives/blades. Many secondary characters are killed. A character takes poison and dies by suicide. Person tied to chair and punched repeatedly. Vehicle chase with lots of crashes. Man grabs woman off the back of motorcycle. A character is taught how to crush a human skull with a foot. A cat is thrown off the roof of a building (it lands safely). Brief kissing. A character uses the phrase ""pop that cherry."" A woman calls a man a ""pervert."" Characters do a dance move called the ""whirlybird"": Initially, a man lifts a woman up so that her legs are on his shoulders, and his face is close to her crotch, then whirls her around in circles; in a later scene, she lifts him up. A use of ""f--k,"" plus sporadic use of ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""a--hole,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""goddamn,"" ""ass,"" ""d--k,"" ""friggin',"" ""scumbag,"" ""crap,"" ""hell."" Exclamatory use of ""Jesus"" and ""God."" Several bottles/glasses of alcohol on display (in offices, in nightclubs, on a plane, on desks, etc.), but very little actual drinking. One character encourages another who's nervous about flying to ""try alcohol. It helps!"" Parents need to know that Argylle is a lightweight but fun and twisty spy thriller with comic/romantic moments about a novelist (Bryce Dallas Howard) who becomes the target of rival spy organizations when her books start to mirror real life. It's from the director of the Kingsman movies but is much less graphic than those films. Still, there are lots of scenes of peril, largely bloodless fighting and shooting, attacks with knives and blades, explosions, and a vehicle chase with crashes. A character is tied to a chair and pummeled, another dies by suicide, and a cat is sometimes in danger. There's brief kissing, mild sex-related dialogue, and some sexy dance moves. Sporadic language includes one use of ""f--k,"" plus ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""goddamn,"" ""ass,"" ""d--k,"" etc. Bottles and glasses of alcohol are seen throughout in clubs, offices, planes, and more, but there's very little actual drinking. Sam Rockwell and Henry Cavill co-star. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. As ARGYLLE opens, superspy Argylle (Henry Cavill) is on another exciting mission, tangling with the deadly LaGrange (Dua Lipa) with help from his stalwart colleagues Wyatt (John Cena) and Keira (Ariana DeBose). But it turns out that they're all characters created by Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), a neurotic but successful novelist who spends virtually all of her time alone with her cat, Alfie. On a train to visit her mother, Elly meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who at first professes to be a fan but is actually a real-life spy. When an attempt is made on Elly's life, Aidan dispatches an army of attackers and saves her from the train. She learns that she's being hunted by an evil organization called The Division, which is led by director Ritter (Bryan Cranston), because her books have come a little too close to the details of real-life spy operations. As a result, both Aidan and The Division believe that Elly might know something about an important file that's gone missing. Simultaneously cleverly complex and gleefully shallow, this slick, twisty spy movie borrows bits and pieces from earlier movies but links them together in a surprising and entertaining way. After his three ultraviolent Kingsman movies, director Matthew Vaughn (working from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs) finds a slightly gentler, less gruesome tone with Argylle. Few innocents die here other than minions working for the evil organization. And Vaughn doesn't try for breakneck speed, but rather spends time on characters and downtime, trying to come up with the next move. For a long movie (139 minutes), Argylle has a nice pace, and it's not exhausting. There's also a striking contrast between the perfect, sculpted ""fictional"" characters in Elly's books and the more flawed ""real-life"" characters that feels right. And while it seems to have sprung from the seeds of Romancing the Stone, it's more progressive, giving Elly more to do and to ponder than simply falling in love with the hero. Maybe Argylle isn't about much of anything—even the Kingsman movies tried to tackle subjects like war, drugs, and climate change—but it's an appealing ride that checks all the right boxes and goes well with a bucket of popcorn. Families can talk about Argylle's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? Do you consider Elly a role model? How does she change over the course of the movie? Does she face the consequences of her actions?

"Feb 20, 2024",positive," Matthew Vaughn is a visionary director who has contributed immensely to the superhero film genre. X-Men: First Class reinvigorated the franchise, and Kick-Ass is easily one of the best superhero movies of all time. However, his latest in Argylle fails to live up to those other films. And despite some typical Vaughn-isms, the movie is very disappointing.  Vaughn is also responsible for The Kingsman movies. The first film in that spy universe launched the career of Taron Egerton, who has gone on to become one of the most interesting actors in the industry. But Vaughn followed it up with additional Kingsman sequels that were never as good as the original. Vaughn tries something new with Argylle, but despite a fun cinematic experience, the movie is pretty disappointing.  Argylle starts as one of those meta movies where a fiction writer becomes involved in a real-life adventure like the ones she writes about. It’s meant to invoke movies like Romancing The Stone, or the more recent Sandra Bullock movie, The Lost City. However, there’s a big twist in Argylle where it separates itself from those movies. But don’t look to me to spoil what the twist is in this Argylle review.  Argylle on its own is an enjoyable cinematic experience. Vaughn is good at innovative action, great camera work, amazing cinematography, and effective use of appropriate needle-drop moments. It’s a rip-roaring good time of explosions, humor, and good-looking people doing cool things. But outside of that, the movie doesn’t offer much else.  The story is engaging enough to keep you hooked for most of the film. The big twist and reveal are interesting, albeit a little convoluted. The third act of the movie is completely unnecessary and loses the audience. Add to this some plot points that get an explanation immediately after we see it. For example: without spoilers— a good supporting character turns bad, and we get an immediate flashback revealing why and how. So audiences can’t even begin to process the twist before any tension from it is defused and we move on to the next unnecessarily complicated plot point. And this happens, a lot! Argylle has a stacked cast. But I’d be remiss in this Argylle review if I didn’t point out, that many of them, do absolutely nothing. The main leads of the movie are Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell. And this is the thing that makes Argylle engaging and keeps you interested; it’s all Howard. Howard is the gem in Argylle that makes you want to keep watching. She is charming, effortless, and the heart of the movie. And when she is with Rockwell, it’s dynamite! While the pairing is good, Rockwell feels like he’s phoning it in. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lot of fun seeing Rockwell do typical leading man things smashing through a floor and taking out bad guys in one fell swoop. But in the quieter moments, Rockwell’s performance seems… disconnected from anything going on. When they’re together, Howard feels like she’s in the moment, whereas Rockwell feels like he wants to leave. The chase scenes and action sequences with Rockwell and Howard are a lot of fun, but without major stakes, it feels like they’re just going through the motions in the story. And that’s where the movie loses me completely.  Ultimately, all these problems wouldn’t be as big of an issue if the main story of the movie had a point. If the emotional arc and journey of the protagonist convey some sense of danger or risk. If the main plot was big enough to rationalize all the craziness that precedes it. Or had consequences that felt enough important enough for us to care. But ultimately, none of those things happen in Argylle. The MacGuffin that drives most of the plot, and the subsequent consequences of it, are so inside-baseball, specific to this world of spies that it’s difficult for audiences outside of it to care about it. And there are so many plot twists, happening so often, that even after everything has a resolution, we’re left with a sense of wondering if this is even real to begin with. The convoluted plot is the movie’s downfall.  Argylle is fun enough to watch in theatres. The grand spectacle of Vaughn’s stylized action sequences is a lot of fun to watch on the big screen. Even after its soon-to-be streaming release on Apple TV+, it will be an enjoyable group movie with family or friends. But looking for anything beyond a superficial good time isn’t recommended.  Argylle is now playing in theatres. What did you think of Argylle? Let me know in the comments below.

"Feb 15, 2024",positive," Most critics don’t seem to be fans of Matthew Vaughn’s new action comedy, Argylle, but luckily, I’m in the minority of those who had a blast with it. The film is about an introverted spy novelist played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is drawn into the activities of a sinister underground organization. It’s best not to reveal too much about the plot because there are so many great twists and turns. And audiences might even be surprised by the direction of the film from the beginning. What I can reveal is that this movie is a silly and outlandish adventure that pokes fun at the spy genre. Much like the King’s Man films, which this romp may or may not be connected to. Vaughn doesn’t always hit his targets. And though this film is long and could easily have 30 minutes trimmed from it, Argylle is a creative screenplay that is elevated by its all-star cast, which along with Howard, includes Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and Samuel L. Jackson.  Some may argue the film doesn’t feature enough of Cavill, but I am all about the incredible chemistry between Howard and Rockwell. The two emotionally and literally light up the screen with their comical banter. They provide an unexpected romantic comedy element that enhances the story and forgives any flaws. It’s best to not take this film too seriously. Just allow yourself to enjoy the ridiculous ride. Argylle is a fast-paced, witty, and action-packed spy comedy that’s well worth seeing on the big screen.

"Feb 15, 2024",neutral," From the uber-violent, uber-British Kingsman to the remarkably prescient but similarly bloody Kick-Ass, Matthew Vaughn has carved a clear niche for himself as the go-to director for ridiculous, high-octane action comedies. His latest effort, Argylle, bears the same stylistic signatures as his earlier works, cranked to eleven—more twists, more gags, more ridiculous fight scenes. But while a star-studded cast may do their best to bring heart and humor to this meta spy mystery, Argylle ultimately buckles under the weight of its own ambition, and the end result is a messy, overlong (if entertaining) romp.  Starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell, Argylle follows Elly Conway (Howard), the reclusive, ultra-successful author behind the Argylle novels—a series of spy mysteries following a debonair secret agent (Henry Cavill). When Elly’s novels begin to inexplicably mirror the high-stakes lives of a real espionage organization, she’s thrown into the middle of a dangerous power play with the mysterious, rough-around-the-edges Aidan (Rockwell) and her cat Alfie as her only allies. Previously, Vaughn’s particular brand of guffaw-inducing humor and gravity-defying action scenes have yielded some gems, striking the perfect balance between ridiculous and self-aware. But in its desperation to get ahead of the viewer and deliver a colorful, twist-filled joyride, Argylle gets lost in the tide of its own plot contrivances. At a whopping two hours and 20 minutes, Argylle assaults the viewer with twist after twist—by the time the film’s last finale rolls around, any novelty or goodwill the first hour inspired is completely gone. It’s a shame, too, because the first act sets up a silly but simple premise with a pair of extremely likable characters—Elly and Aidan are a perfect old-school, opposites-attract duo, made all the more electric through Rockwell and Howard’s chemistry. The early beats of Argylle also use a dream sequence mechanic to weave Cavill’s Agent Agylle into the story through a series of clever editing choices. But somewhere around the halfway point, Argylle begins grinding its gears—the action sequences begin to overstay their welcome, the dream sequence mechanic is all but forgotten, and the Elly/Aidan dynamic is disrupted by a twist that seems to exist purely to pull one over on the audience. Though the bones of Argylle are undoubtedly intriguing, Vaughn’s overindulgence puts form over function, resulting in an entertaining but ultimately misguided action-comedy. PG-13, 139 min. "

	                                    	Two elaborate action sequences in Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle make you wonder if these were the motivation to make this spy thriller. One is a choreographed set piece in which the central characters Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Aidan (Sam Rockwell), fight off relentless attack by the bad guys in clouds of colourful smoke. In another, Howard fashions makeshift skates and glides across an oily floor gracefully felling another set of attackers.  There’s another big fight on an American train, then another in a building in London and a car chase through Greece. Binding it all is a story within a story about bestselling author Elli Conway who writes novels about a Johhny Bravo-styled spy called ‘Argylle’ (Henry Cavill), who becomes quite a model for the Nehru jacket. John Cena plays Argylle’s partner Wyatt and Ariana DeBose is Keira, their tech support. Argylle and his team are in pursuit of femme fatale LaGrange, played by Dua Lipa. Conway’s stories somehow predict real life geo-political events, which makes her a person of interest for various covert operators and an underground syndicate headed by Ritter (Bryan Cranston).  Why is Elly’s life under threat and why is Aidan so invested in her survival? It's not possible to address this without giving away spoilers; suffice to say it’s not easy to separate fact from fiction in this bloated script (written by Jason Fuchs). In an otherwise scant film, Vaughn’s action visuals pop but slightly, like the popping of bubble wrap. A mid-credits scene suggests a prequel, connecting Argylle with Kingsman and Vaughn’s intention to create his own wry and stylized spy-verse.  Argylle is devoid of that wicked self-deprecatory humour and black comedy one has come to associate with Vaughn, who has helmed the Kick-Ass and Kingsman films. He does load the screen with cameos and star appearances including Dua Lipa, Samuel L. Jackson, Cranston, Sofia Boutella, Catherine O’Hara and Jing Lusi. A cat named Alfie, who appears to be computer-generated, travels the world with Elly in her cat-pack. Alfie also becomes part of a running gag in the 139-minute-long film. Bryce Dallas Howards holds her scenes, conveying her character’s distress and disorientation, and her scenes with Rockwell have a smidge of verve.  Aidan’s entry into Elly’s life is accompanied by a sudden eruption of violence. If Elly is confused by these events, by her relationship with Aidan, by Ritter and his motivation, by the belated entry of a music box (which initiates an excruciating fight sequence), then she is not alone. The viewer is just as flummoxed."

"Feb 13, 2024",negative," Bryce Dallas Howard from the (Jurassic World franchise) is Elly Conway, the author of a series of best-selling spy novels. Her books center on secret agent Argylle (Henry Cavill) and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate; the film gets interesting. When Elly is traveling by train with her cat Alfie, she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real spy, and the fantasy adventure begins. Director Matthew Vaughn of the “Kingsman” movies creates a new chapter to his spy genre and his Kingsman: The Secret Service films. The latest spy character, Argylle, Henry Cavill, is excellent and lots of fun! He’s the archetypal spy with his gallant good looks, British accent, and the ability to, of course, conquer all. His team is ready to help behind the scenes to aid in his escape plan. John Cena and Ariana DeBose play them. He can escape any situation as he has for four different adventures that Elly Conway wrote. She’s out promoting her fourth novel while putting the finishing touches on the fifth book. Elly’s books have oddly predicted what happens in the real espionage world. Getting back to Aidan, the spy is dressed like a homeless person. He tries to warn her she’s in grave danger and that an evil group is out to use her to predict where some dangerous codes and files could be located. Yes, she’s way over her head as life imitates art, and she has no one to trust except her cat, Alfie. Going into survival mode, her action scenes are incredible to watch as she fights for her life by robot kicking and punching her way out of each situation. Unfortunately, the main problem is the action scenes need to be shorter, causing the movie to become boring. There’s potential for the film to become a franchise, as “Argylle” does keep you guessing until the very end. Although the less is, more approach would garner better results here. I did enjoy watching Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell together, although they couldn’t save the film. The movie also stars John Cena, Catherine O’Hara, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson, Ariana DeBose, and Dua Lipa."
"Feb 13, 2024",negative," The main character is Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard,) a best-selling novelist who writes about espionage. She lives alone with her Scottish Fold cat named Alfie, who joins her when she travels for presentations to her adoring fans. She is afraid of flying, so, when she encounters writer’s block as she tries to end her latest book, she takes a train to visit her mother (Catherine O’Hara.) Another passenger named Aidan (Sam Rockwell) takes the seat across from her. He’s reading “Argylle,” her latest book. That’s also the name of the spy (played by Henry Cavill) she created, and whom she sees throughout her adventures. With all of its twists and turns, and every cliché ever included in a spy movie, you’d think this would be exciting. It’s not. Just because its references other movies doesn’t mean this screenplay is funny or clever. Although there are some entertaining comical moments, most of the attempts at humor fall with a thud. Imitation without wit does not a parody make. The whole movie appears to have been produced by AI and CGI – even the cat, which I imagine was supposed to relieve the tedium, looks like it’s a CGI creation in nearly every scene. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Feb 12, 2024",neutral," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters now is Argylle, a fun star-studded little spy romp about a fictional spy named Argylle played by Henry Cavill that’s a figment of an author’s imagination who gets swept up into a real life spy novel situation when characters try to track her down and extract what’s going to happen next to get ahead by forcing her to write. It’s a pretty creative romp from director Matthew Vaughn with some funny hammy performances from Bryan Cranston, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard and Cavill. It’s lighthearted but somehow a little too long and not as sharp as Vaughn’s previous work and certainly no Bond movie but it is a pretty good big screen adventure. Throw in Dua Lipa, John Cena, Samuel L Jackson and a few other surprises for good measure and some romance, some action, and a few laughs so basically it’s got a little something for everyone but probably not enough of one thing for most people. That’s it for this week. Join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK, AMFM Magazine, and RECRD."
"Feb 12, 2024",negative,"Argylle is bloated, full of cliches, and quickly becomes self-indulgent.

While twists and turns come early and often, highlighted by a strong first act, the film ends up overly manic and outlandish to find any footing. Just a bit too convoluted."

"Feb 10, 2024",negative," Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), holding her cat Alfie (Chip), has to dodge bad guys like those of her fictional spy character, in the action comedy “Argylle.” (Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures, Apple Original Films and MARV.) If you’re familiar with director Matthew Vaughn’s work — in particular, his spy-driven action comedy “Kingsman” and its less-inspired sequels — you know everything that “Argylle” is or ever hopes to be: Loud, fast, sometimes audacious in its stylized violence, but also a little exhausting. The opening is a stunner, introducing the super-suave spy Argylle (Henry Cavill), on his latest mission. He is infiltrating a den of villains to apprehend the villain Lagrange (Dua Lipa) — but, first, some hot dancing and some gunplay. Then Argylle and his tech-savvy sidekick, Wyatt (John Cena), capture Lagrange and get a clue on information that will bring down Argylle’s compromised agency and its director (Richard E. Grant). Elly calls her mom (Catherine O’Hara) for her notes on her next installment in the Argylle series, and Mom thinks Elly needs one more chapter to finish the story. Elly decides to take the train (she hates to fly) to meet Mom in Chicago, and it’s on the train that she meets Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a scraggly guy who says he’s a big fan of Elly’s books. Aidan also tells Elly that he’s works in espionage — and, to prove it, he beats up the trainload of men trying to kill Elly. Aidan fills Elly in on a big secret: Her books are closer to reality than she knows. The shadowy agency does exist, and the director, Ritter (Bryan Cranston), has been compromised. Aidan needs Elly’s help to find a missing thumb drive that will help take down Ritter — if Aidan can get Elly to overcome her squeamishness and get the drive to Ritter’s nemesis, the former CIA director Alfred Solomon (Samuel L. Jackson).  The biggest secret in Jason Fuchs’ script — the one the studio is begging critics and early moviegoers not to divulge — is the identity of the “real” spy on which Argylle is modeled. I’m not planning to give anything away, though it doesn’t take a lot of mental agility to figure it out. The action sequences are expertly handled and loaded with almost comical levels of violence. They feel, after a few of them, like a “Kingsman” greatest hits reel. If you liked Colin Firth’s dispatching of ruffians in that movie, there’s a sequence of Rockwell doing something similar here. If you liked the cartoonishly choreographed heads exploding there, you’ll like the colorful ballet through tear gas here. And so on. The plot manages to be both convoluted and simplistic at the same time — with a lot of moving parts, but all of them pointing in the same inevitable direction.  The cast provides some pleasures along the way. Cavill is having fun as the debonair fictional spy (and possibly auditioning for James Bond), while O’Hara makes the most of a surprising role, and Rockwell adds his own scruffy charms as Aidan. But the most delight in the uneven “Argylle” is watching Bryce Dallas Howard revel in the sort of action-packed leading lady role she’s never been given — and, it turns out, she’s better at it than some of the male leads to whom she’s had to play second fiddle."
"Feb 9, 2024",negative," His career got off to a promising start with several action films, including “Layer Cake,” “The Kingsmen” and “Kick-Ass,” but it feels as if Vaughn has been spinning his wheels as of late with “The Kingsmen” turning into a somewhat profitable franchise for the filmmaker. “Argylle” arrives as essentially more of the same, disguised as something original. It’s an overstuffed action flick that really feels the weight of its massive 139 minute run time – hindered by a story that grows more uninteresting with every plot twist. In “Argylle,” Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elly, a reclusive writer who has just finished the fifth book in her popular series about a spy named Argylle. While on a train to visit her family, Elly is saved from an ambush by a real-life spy named Aiden (Sam Rockwell). He then informs Elly that her novel series has drawn the attention of a secret spy organization because her novels have mirrored actual events – even predicting the future. At first, Elly is reluctant to believe Aiden, but as more and more people keep targeting her, the more she realizes that she is really in danger – with Aiden perhaps the only person capable of helping her find out who is targeting her. “Argylle” is a film that takes many twists and turns, with some major developments that the studio has asked to keep a secret for the audience. That creates a big problem when discussing the film because a lot of what doesn’t work involves these secrets. Some of the plot twists only make it obvious that certain cast members are completely miscast, while Jason Fuchs’ screenplay seems more intent on piling up those plot twists (much of which are rather easy to see coming and pretty eye-rolling) instead of actually creating characters the audience can invest in. The film features a loaded cast that includes Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Ariana DeBose and Samuel L. Jackson, but this cast is mostly wasted with only Rockwell given much time to truly shine. Then there is Vaughn’s direction, which is more of that the same frenetically paced mayhem that has become a staple in his recent films. These sequences that should be the highlights of the film quickly become repetitive, with some creative decisions that only distract from the action. “Argylle” is one giant cinematic mess, an action film that completely misfires from start to finish. Perhaps it is time Vaughn tries something new. A romantic comedy perhaps?"
"Feb 9, 2024",negative," No, wait, don’t answer that: of course I’m going crazy. We all are. But I mean specifically, in the case of Argylle, this new action (alleged) comedy. Because I startled myself awake the morning after my screening the evening before with the shocking realization that nothing in the trailer — which has been ubiquitous and inescapable at cinemas for months now — is actually in the damn movie. Or is it? Maybe some of it is? The movie itself had already faded from memory, mere hours later, it’s that blah, though it’s frantic not to be taken as so. But the trailer is, alas, more seared into my brain than the movie it wanted to sell me, to the point that less than half a day later, I wasn’t quite able to separate the two. It’s like how you can’t be quite sure whether you genuinely remember something from your early childhood or if you’re just recalling people talking about it. Because you know what? Whether my memory is accurate on a granular level doesn’t matter. Many movie trailers include scenes that don’t end up in the final film — trailers are often cut before production has even wrapped — but even then, those trailers are usually broadly representative of what you’ll see in the cinema. (There is a new and worrying trend in which trailers for movie musicals hide the fact that they’re musicals. But that’s a rant for another day.) That Argylle trailer, though? I don’t think I’ve seen a more deceptive tease for a movie ever. (Never fear! Argylle is not a musical.) Argylle is absolutely not, no matter how much the trailer insists, a cheeky Henry Cavill–kinda-sorta-as–James Bond chunk of delightfully winking spy nonsense. Cavill is barely in the film (and when he is, the film does him no favors). Also barely appearing: John Cena (The Suicide Squad, Fighting with My Family) as his muscly sidekick, which is downright criminal, given Cena’s now-proven comedic chops. Pop star Dua Lipa as their slinky-lady-villain opponent is also barely in the film, so any of her fans — and why cast her if not to draw in her fans? — hoping for a more meaty performance after her brief screen debut in Barbie will be disappointed. Also here for the paycheck: Bryan Cranston (Isle of Dogs, The Disaster Artist), Catherine O’Hara (When Marnie Was There, Frankenweenie), Ariana DeBose (I.S.S.) and Samuel L. Jackson (The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), the latter fully embracing his phoning-it-in-because-he-can status. What we get instead is a sad-sack Bryce Dallas Howard (Rocketman, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom) — honestly, director Matthew Vaughn does not flatter any of his cast — as spy-novel writer Elly Conway, who gets caught up in supposedly real-life espionage shenanigans as a tagalong to Sam Rockwell’s Aidan Wilde, a real-life spy. Stuff she’s invented for her hugely bestselling books turns out to be actually real, Aidan informs her as he shanghais her into adventures ’n’ shit, to the chagrin of the bad guys. Somebody’s worried, anyway. It’s all a bit of a muddle. Even Rockwell’s (The Bad Guys, Trolls: World Tour) trademarked impudence is smothered. In between unconvincing CGI bullshit and frenetic fight scenes that seem to exist merely as a showcase for Vaughn’s (Kingsman: The Golden Circle, X-Men: First Class) overstuffed manic style, we’re asked to ponder what’s real and what isn’t: Elly keeps seeing, in the midst of the frenzy, flashes of Cavill’s Agent Argylle. But is there a “real” Argylle, and if so, who could it be? The marketing for the film implores us not to “let the cat out of the bag” once we know the secret. (There’s a running “joke” about Elly’s pet cat, which is along for the shenanigans in one of those appalling pet-carrier backpacks that you should never ever put a cat in. The movie leans hard into it, and it’s the most cynical kind of distraction, a desperate attempt to, I dunno, create Internet memes, perhaps, without having the teensiest understanding of what makes cat content, or anything else, go viral online.) But the secret is simultaneously completely obvious and utterly ridiculous along multiple vectors. Talking about it once we’re beyond the worry over spoilers won’t even be any fun, just a tedious mopping-up task. The marketing for the film also wants to get us excited by how this is “from the twisted mind of Matthew Vaughn.” Spoiler: There is nothing in the least bit twisted about Argylle. Unless the word twisted is being deployed here as a strange catchall for crass, confused, and charmless, in which case this may be the Matthew Vaughn–est movie yet. The inept script, by Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman, Ice Age: Continental Drift), makes zero distinction between the “fictional” spy malarkey of the adventures of Cavill’s (Justice League, Mission: Impossible – Fallout) Argylle and the “real” exploits that Elly finds herself in the midst of. Surely good fun entertaining comedy, perhaps even some bittersweet pathos, could be mined from the contrast between over-the-top cinematic depictions of spy stuff — the movie opens with a wannabe-Bondian scene of Cavill’s Argylle in action before revealing to us that this is merely an excerpt from the book Elly is writing — and the down-to-earth reality of authentic, unexciting spycraft that Rockwell’s “real spy” would be muddling through. It’s not just that Vaughn stages every single thing that happens here with his usual goes-to-11 hyperactive vulgarity, though he does. It’s that a story about the difference between fiction and reality has decided that reality is just as monotonously cartoonish as, ahem, a blockbuster movie that is rumored to have cost $200 million to produce and yet somehow looks cheap as hell. If Elly’s “real life” is as much cinematic balderdash as the fiction she invents, what happens if we come up another level of the Argylle Inception? Yup, Vaughn fumbles the smug meta he brings into the real–real-world level, too. His movie is purportedly inspired by a novel by a writer called “Elly Conway,” by book four in a series of spy thrillers, although the first book has only just been published, in conjunction with the film’s release. As with trailers that feature scenes not in the movie, the years-long schedules of Hollywood productions certainly can and do culminate in movies based on books that have not yet been published — movie rights are often shopped by publishing houses as soon as manuscripts are acquired, which is typically 18 months or more before publication. But it seems vanishingly unlikely that a Book Four from a completely unknown author would even be written at this point in the entire process, never mind snagging such a sweet and lucrative deal. Is the author unknown, though? There’s a “conspiracy” theory that Taylor Swift(!) wrote the book. There’s another that the first version of the film’s script was written by JK Rowling, and that the plot was about “JK Rowling” discovering that the wizarding world actually exists; this seems to have grown out of the fact that the director stated a while back that he was inspired by that concept. Vaughn has been insisting that the book is the real deal, but as with every single other aspect of this movie, it doesn’t matter, even now that the identity of “Elly Conway” has been revealed (and it’s as underwhelming as the “secret” of Argylle). There is nothing behind this vacuous multitentacled exercise in pop-culture marketing but flatulent hot air. But as for the “twisted mind” stuff, perhaps it’s like Duncan Jones describing Moon as “hard science fiction”: it really isn’t, there are all sorts of scientific errors and ways the company could do things differently that would break the plot and be cheaper for them, but it doesn’t have laser battles and spaceships that go whizz boom, so by Hollyword standards that makes it hard SF. When mainstream film is doggedly straightforward and offers no surprises at all, maybe a brief moment of confusion counts as twisted."
"Feb 9, 2024",negative," Director Matthew Vaughn is capable of some pretty incredible work (Kick-Ass, the first Kingsman movie, X-Men: First Class) and he’s amassed a fun collection of regular actors who support his visions, no matter how twisted or misguided they may be. His latest work, Argylle, is maybe his most ambitious film to date, but size isn’t everything. In fact, it’s the sheer excess of plot that ultimately crushes his tale of spies, both real and imagined, in this tale of author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), whose spy novels and their alarming accuracy get her into a heap of trouble.  Borrowing heavily from everything from Romancing the Stone to Sandra Bullock’s The Lost City, Argylle finds Elly imagining a world of spies that look like Henry Cavill (as the titular, fictional character), John Cena (as the trusted sidekick), Ariana DeBose (as their person in the chair), and even Dua Lipa (as the latest book’s villain, who is also a great dancer). As she’s on tour with her latest work, Elly lets it slip that her next book in the series is arriving sooner than her fans think. In fact, it’s basically done. But her mother (Catherine O’Hara) thinks the new book’s cliffhanger ending is a copout and demands she wrap things up more neatly by writing one more chapter. It turns out that there are a lot of interested parties in the next chapter of her just-finished work, because her stories tend to predict or mirror real-life events going on in the spy world. A whole host of intelligence agents begins hunting her down to find out the location of a certain thumb-drive of information, because where her Agent Argylle goes, the real world apparently follows. One of these spies, supposedly on the side of good, is Aidan (Sam Rockwell), whose primary objective is protecting Elly (and her cat in a suitcase, Alfie, that she can’t go anywhere without) and helping complete her novel so he can find out where this data is hidden. There are a few decent action sequences here and there, and Rockwell is doing some of his finest Sam Rockwell-style acting, but for most of the film, Howard is a screeching dud who would rather yell at Rockwell than do anything productive in order to save her own life. To make matters worse, director Vaughn uses a visual gag that basically amounts to Rockwell and Cavill changing places every time Elly blinks, because she can’t imagine that a schlub like Aidan could possibly be the kind of spy she dreamed up in the character of Argylle. It’s visually jarring and takes us out of the moment every time he uses it, which is in many of the early action sequences. Also turning up for a little supporting color are Bryan Cranston as the head of a global spy syndicate, Sofia Boutella as a point of contact known as the Keeper of Secrets (she doesn’t get to fight, so I barely cared she was in this), and Samuel L. Jackson as the former CIA head and Aidan’s boss. There comes a certain point in the plot where I can’t really talk about any of the twists and turns (and there are thousands of them), but after a while, I stopped caring. It’s all too much, all in the service of doing little more than letting the film spin its wheels, extending its running time (this thing runs damn near two hours and 20 minutes), and attempting to turn Howard into an action star. Explain something to me: why is this approach to the spy genre better than simply telling a skillful tale of espionage? How does that extra layer of story make Argylle a better movie? The truth is, it doesn’t, and a part of me thinks screenwriter Jason Fuchs knows that. Instead, it makes it unnecessarily complex, full of secrets that only seem to be secrets to Elly, which I think is done in service of the comedic elements of the movie, very few of which are actually funny (with the exception of a few likely improvised zingers from Rockwell, who is the only performer that got me through this movie). At best, the film is a showcase for Rockwell; at its worst, Argylle is an overblown action movie that gives us very little we haven’t seen before (with the exception of the cat); most of the time, it’s aggressively mediocre.  To cap it all off, there’s a mid-credits scene that unexpectedly and pointlessly ties the movie to another franchise (you won’t have to bend your brain too much to figure out which one), and I was left speechless and more than a bit annoyed.

"Feb 9, 2024",neutral," You know there’s a problem when the selling point of “Argylle” is Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa when it should be the film’s major players Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell. Director Matthew Vaughn (“Kingsman” franchise, “Kick-Ass”) and writer Jason Fuchs (“I Still See You”) deliver an overblown CGI-laden spy film that makes the last few “Fast & Furious” movies seem like conceivable dramas (that includes Tej and Roman driving a car in space). The convoluted storyline gets better after the twist, but boredom sets in despite the barrage of A-list antics, off-key musical interludes, and that darn cat. Swifties love a good conspiracy theory, fortunately, this one doesn’t pan out. “Argylle” is the story of author and cat lady Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) whose novels are centered on dashing super spy Argylle played by Henry Cavill who trades in the Superman look for a Vanilla Ice haircut. His latest antagonist is the exotic villain and femme fatal Lagrange (could have used some ZZ Top on the soundtrack) played by pop star Dua Lipa who is actually very good. Argylle’s team includes tech whiz Wyatt (John Cena) and field agent Keira (Ariana DeBose) who engage in a car-motorcycle chase through the narrow and winding streets of Greece leading to some of the worst CGI effects since “Birdemic: Shock and Terror.” Her latest book in the series, still unpublished, needs an ending according to her mom Ruth (Catherine O’Hara) so Elly jumps on a train with her cat Alfie in a backpack and leaves Colorado for a visit with the parental units in Chicago. FYI, Alfie is played by Claudia Schiffer’s cat Chip. The supermodel is married to director Vaughn, but it’s evident that Chip is only in a handful of scenes after bad CGI rears its ugly head several times, inserting a digital cat into most of the film. In one scene, Alfie is being stroked by a character whose hands, on occasion, don’t make contact with the feline. Cena usually brings the laughs, but not here. The comedy comes from Sam Rockwell as a real spy named Aidan who rescues Elly from a handful of assassins on the Chicago-bound train. He tells Elly that her novels are very close to actual events in the espionage world. Real spies consider her a “fortune teller.” Bryan Cranston plays the villainous Ritter who runs The Division, a spy organization out to get Elly so they can read her next chapter which reportedly contains a file with the names of various secret spies. Sure, it’s fiction, but remember her novels shadow ‘real-world events’ meaning a real file with possible real names. The plot is convoluted and gets worse as imaginary characters and real ones collide. The twist in the story helps make sense of all these shenanigans but then there’s a whacky finale that resembles a music video with plumes of colorful smoke, oil skating (think ice skating minus ice, with oil), and music selections from The Beatles, Patrick Cowley with Sylvester, Barry White, and a new song by Ariana DeBose, Boy George & Nile Rodgers. “Argylle” drags on for two hours and 19 minutes and in that time, we get more stars including Samuel L. Jackson as a wine-loving ex-CIA director, Sofia Boutella as a mysterious character from the past, and Richard E. Grant as a spy director character in Elly’s books, all who are just passing the time and getting paid. Bryce Dallas Howard looks uninspired but at least Sam Rockwell is entertaining.

"Feb 9, 2024",negative," A spy caper filtered through the lens of an author’s existential crisis, Argylle is either too clever or not clever enough for its own good. Either way, style overwhelms substance throughout the latest twisty saga from British director Matthew Vaughn (the Kingsman trilogy), which struggles to generate consistent intrigue or suspense. As a satire, it indulges in many of the same genre tropes it seeks to subvert. The opening sequence sets an appropriate visually extravagant tone, as debonair agent Argylle (Henry Cavill) flirts with an alluring woman (Dua Lipa) to Barry White’s “You’re the First, the Last, My Everything” before the two wind up on opposite sides of a perilous chase through urban Greece. Soon after, we learn that their showdown never happened at all, but was rather invented by Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard), a reclusive writer on the verge of completing her latest globetrotting espionage novel. Yet her mother (Catherine O’Hara) argues the ending is incomplete. Perhaps it’s because Elly is almost impossibly timid and averse to adventure — she’s never even been on a plane — and she doesn’t really know her subject. So she hops a train home, only to encounter the disheveled Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who claims to be a spy himself, with a connection to the characters in her books, no less. The convoluted screenplay by Jason Fuchs (Pan) gradually reveals details of its multilayered mythology and the characters with varying motives and agendas entangled in a complex web of deception and betrayal, shifting loyalties and mistaken identities. We meet other enigmatic figures including Argylle’s colleagues (John Cena and Ariana DeBose), a mysterious bureaucratic official (Bryan Cranston), and a philosophical ex-CIA officer (Samuel L. Jackson) with various levels of involvement in a high-tech conspiracy. The film is most appealing while unspooling Vaughn’s cheeky if ostentatious set pieces, which are sharply choreographed, and accompanied by the requisite cool retro soundtrack and exotic scenery. Meanwhile, the eclectic ensemble cast does its best to inject emotional depth into a head-scratching story that’s more about secrets than sympathy, and nobody is a clear-cut hero or villain. As reality and fantasy begin to blend together, Argylle doesn’t provide sufficient incentive for moviegoers to care about which is which — or who prevails in the final chapter."
"Feb 9, 2024",negative," There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. Frankly, if any movie is worth seeing on the big screen, it’s the UFC-themed remake of an ’80s cult hit from the director responsible for The Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow. (I’ll project Road House on the side of my apartment building if I have to.) But Liman’s public dustup with Amazon is also emblematic of the big-picture anxieties around the future of cinemas in the streaming age. To that end, Netflix is so adamant on prioritizing streaming that the company’s head of film, Scott Stuber, is leaving after seven years at the helm—a decision influenced in part by co-CEO Ted Sarandos’s refusal to give any of Netflix’s films a full theatrical release. But in the past year, one streamer has pulled a 180 and embraced the theatrical experience. For now, at least, Apple has emerged as an unlikely haven for auteur-driven blockbusters. Since launching in November 2019, Apple TV+ has prioritized quality over quantity when it comes to its original programming. The company’s success rate is far from perfect, but in essence, Apple is trying to build its reputation the same way HBO did. That sentiment extends to the Apple Original Films banner, which made history in 2022 when the coming-of-age drama CODA became the first movie distributed by a streamer to win Best Picture. But if it feels like CODA almost immediately vanished from the cultural conversation, it might have something to do with the film’s nonexistent theatrical push. In fact, CODA had such a limited run in cinemas that Apple didn’t disclose its box office numbers; Deadline estimates that the movie grossed as little as $500,000 prior to its big Oscar win.  Apple’s film strategy was meant to entice people to sign up for the streamer, but the downside is that even a Best Picture winner will barely make a ripple in the zeitgeist without a meaningful presence in cinemas, especially when all data points to Apple TV+ having far fewer subscribers than its competitors. (Did you know Tom Hanks wrote and starred in Greyhound, Apple’s well-received Dad Blockbuster about a Navy commander tasked with defending Allied ships from German U-boats? Exactly.) Now, Apple is leaning in the opposite direction: Like Amazon, the company has pledged to spend $1 billion annually on movies that will be released in theaters. And if you want to show people you mean business on the big screen, there’s no better statement of intent than footing the bill for Martin Scorsese’s latest masterpiece.  In Killers of the Flower Moon, based on David Grann’s nonfiction book of the same name, Scorsese covers a harrowing period in American history known as the Reign of Terror, during which members of the Osage Nation were systematically killed by perpetrators seeking to inherit their wealth. It’s the kind of movie you rarely see from a major studio these days, least of all when it comes with an eye-popping budget of $200 million. (Killers of the Flower Moon was originally set up at Paramount, but soaring production costs led Apple to finance the project.) While Killers of the Flower Moon ended up grossing just north of $155 million, Apple has a different metric for success that isn’t reliant on box office receipts. (And for what it’s worth, earning more than $155 million is no small feat for a film covering such grim subject matter over a 206-minute running time.) Killers of the Flower Moon has since been nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, while demonstrating how Apple can fill the void for filmmakers who may struggle to get certain kinds of movies made in the current studio landscape.  In that spirit, Apple’s next major theatrical release was Napoleon, Ridley Scott’s historical epic about the infamous French emperor, as played by Joaquin Phoenix. While the critical reception to Napoleon was more mixed, the film ended up crossing the $200 million threshold at the box office, an impressive achievement in and of itself. (The movie also scored three Oscar nominations.) With the release of Napoleon, Apple added to its burgeoning reputation as an auteur-friendly streamer that treats theatrical distribution as an essential part of its strategy. Which leads us to Apple’s third blockbuster heading to cinemas: Argylle.  At the same time, it’s important to remember that Apple isn’t doing all of this out of the goodness of its heart: The company is in the business of promoting a streaming service, and ensuring blockbusters get a proper run in cinemas is a great way to attract top talent. There’s no guarantee that Apple will stick to this strategy in the long run, or that the company won’t butt heads with creatives the way Amazon has. But in the meantime, Apple has transformed into a viable alternative to Hollywood’s major studios—and is taking a bite out of its competition.

"Feb 8, 2024",negative," Synopsis: A reclusive author who writes espionage novels about a secret agent and a global spy syndicate realizes the plot of the new book she’s writing starts to mirror real-world events, in real time. I imagine that during the studio pitch, director Matthew Vaughn and scribe Jason Fuchs sold Argylle as a fun spy adventure with twists at every turn. I’m almost certain that the words “spectacular,” “stunning,” and “remarkable” were never uttered and were intentionally left out because there is simply nothing surprising about any of the curveballs it tries to throw at the audience. Any spy cliche or trope you can think of, Argylle has it in spades. The result is a jam-packed film overstuffed with so much utter nonsense that you could call it an attack on the senses with diphenhydramine. And that’s a shame because anyone who loves a good spy novel or movie should love Argylle. You have a great cast where Bryce Dallas Howard plays a socially reclusive author, Elly Conway, who spends too much time with her cat, Argylle, and not enough trying to find someone to share her life with. That’s her mother (the irreplaceable Catherine O’Hara) talking, who also adds the fifth book in the Agent Argylle series, which doesn’t have an ending that will appease her fans. However, her novels have hit too close to home. At least, that’s what a stranger on a train named Aiden (Sam Rockwell) tells her before defending her against a couple of dozen armed assassins. Confusingly, Howard’s Elly keeps trying to run away from Aiden, the one man not trying to kill her, but we will get into that later. Aiden helps her escape and then tells her about a secret rogue organization called The Division, led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston), who wants to abduct Elly (and not her cat) to find out how she unwittingly knows so much about their dirty deeds that she puts to paper. The film slogs along at 134 minutes. To put that in perspective, that’s on par with the last three of the Fast & Furious franchise, and some of the things that happen in Argylle are just as ludicrous. It’s hard to tell you just how much that’s true with facts because we cannot ruin it with spoilers. As much as I try to keep things cautious, most of this involves laying parallel narratives with Elly’s previous four Argylle novels, the current one she is trying to write, and the real-life mystery that places it all together. Frankly, Fuchs’s script thinks it’s smarter than it is. Much of the film’s plot relies on red herrings or implausible common-sense connections. Not to mention the endless montages of a one-note joke comparing Henry Cavill’s Argylle to Sam Rockwell’s Aiden. When the film makes its big reveals, it’s more of a cheap trick where, if you look back, significant character decisions feel like filler and vain attempts to move the story forward. Vaughn tries to distract most of this with big names, handsome faces, the charm of its leads, and a cute cat. And to his credit, he nearly does. Rockwell brings the type of mixed lunacy and folksy charm that has made him a household name. I could see the pairing of Henry Cavill and John Cena in a real-life buddy action comedy. I will admit the film’s best scene, involving a ridiculously goofy song and dance ballet of bullets, did put a wicked grin on my face. It’s so out of place but so entertaining that I almost forgave everything that came before it.  Samuel L. Jackson’s cameo is a head-scratcher. He plays a former head of the CIA with a man cave filled with sports memorabilia, a ticker for stocks and sports betting, and a movie-sized screen for espionage and Lakers games. Personally, I was hoping this was Jackson’s real-life office, and he made the filmmakers bring the cameras to his doorstep in a power move built off his legendary Hollywood swagger and gravitas. And that’s how distracted I was with the relentless onslaught of Hollywood nothingness that Argylle is (or maybe that’s just my crippling case of ADHD). Even the final scene and mid-credits scene are head-scratching. While I enjoyed the endless charm of Rockwell, you’ll be asking yourself, “Who cares?” until the final credits roll."
"Feb 8, 2024",negative," (KGET) — Director Matthew Vaughn created an engaging and fun film a decade ago with the spy tale “Kingsman: The Secret Service.” He blended the quirks of an everyday bloke — played by Taron Egerton — with the cool sophistication of a classic spy story. That original “Kingsman” — from story to acting — worked to near perfection. His latest spy/civilian tale, “Argylle” is nearly perfectly awful from story to acting. It is not smart enough to be intriguing and not enough of a spoof to be funny. It falls into that deadly zone of being a film that should have opened in more than one thousand paper shredders rather than theaters. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a successful writer of spy novels. She enjoys staying at home to write and hang out with her cat, Alfie. The hero of her stories is Agent Argylle — played in hunky fashion by Henry Cavill. Her latest book has Argylle ready to expose an evil spy organization. That’s when Conway learns that her books have so closely mirrored the real spy world that she is being tracked down to reveal what is to happen in chapters she has not written. Only the appearance of oddball Aidan (Sam Rockwell) — who falls somewhere between Inspector Clouseau and James Bond — saves her. It also puts her on the run for her life with her cat riding in the carrier on her back. “Argylle” immediately has problems as it comes across as being too close to the 2022 Sandra Bullock film “The Lost City.” Bullock played a romance novelist whose life is in danger when her research for her latest book gets the attention of a ruthless billionaire. Vaughn’s film varies from that path because of the jumbled script by Jason Fuchs (“Wonder Woman”). The story goes from the writer’s reality that drifts into fiction to a tale of fiction where the good and bad guys change sides more than a one-sided tennis match. There’s reality, fictionalized reality, fictionalized fiction and then mass confusion. The film drags on and on. That comes as a surprise because the opening number with Dua Lipa, Cavill and John Cena could be attached to the start of any James Bond movie and gets the film off to a flying start. When Lipa’s brief time ends, the film settles into the flailing attempts to be funny, dramatic, romantic, political and intriguing. There is no concern that time elements, medical plot twists or even the entire basis of the story makes no sense. Fuchs does a masterful job of making it all so incoherent that it becomes a lump of writing failure. Magnifying all the writing problems is Vaugn’s indecision as to how to tell the story. All the advertising focuses on Conway’s cat that at times is so poorly created through computer graphics a stick figure would have been more believable. But the cat is nothing more than a story furball that is overly annoying. The crowning moment of cinematic defeat comes in a massive shootout near the (much welcomed) ending. Two characters must fight their way down a hallway filled with at least 100 guards firing at them. They use colorful smoke to shoot the guards and not get hit. Vaughn’s staging is so far into the realm of silliness that nothing could help it. He drives ahead by turning the scene into something so goofy that it would have created cringing in a cheesy romantic comedy. And the scene just can’t find an ending much like the entire movie. Howard does her best but never sells any of the alternative versions of her from the novelist. Rockwell tries to pick up the energy but even an Oscar-winner can’t raise the dead. “Argylle” is supposed to be the spark to get the zombie-like 2024 movie season going. It is also a major gamble from the streaming service Apple TV. This masterful mess should not be counted on for any good news on either front. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Feb 8, 2024",neutral,I wasn't bored but I also wasn't on the edge of my seat. The stakes weren't high enough.
"Feb 7, 2024",negative," With Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kick-Ass, English filmmaker Matthew Vaughn has twice shaken up stiff action subgenres with explosive energy and irreverence. These movies not only delivered gonzo violence, cascades of cursing, and bawdy sex jokes but also launched sequels. With the action-comedy Argylle, Vaughn seems to be at it again. But this time, he's surrendered the hard-R rating that's long served him well, instead presenting audiences with a PG-13 spy tale that regrettably pulls its punches.  It's not just a matter of a high body count with virtually no blood (a trick Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy pulled as well). It's that without the R-rating, Vaughn is constrained to do something tamer. And for him, that means making a movie for women, where danger, romance, and hilarious hijinks — well, not so much collide as bump into each other awkwardly. See, Vaughn has no idea what women want, turning in a tedious espionage adventure that is too much in all the wrong ways.  The premise of Argylle has echoes of the 1984 comedy Romancing the Stone, in which Kathleen Turner stars as a romance novelist named Joan who gets swept up in an adventure that seems ripped from her book's pages. (See also the Sandra Bullock romp The Lost City). Along the way, Joan fights and then falls in love with a rugged rogue named Jack (Michael Douglas). Argylle screenwriter Jason Fuchs contorts this setup slightly: Bryce Dallas Howard stars as Elly Conway, a heralded author of spy novels who finds herself caught up in a web of intrigue. Along the way, Elly becomes entangled with a real spy named Aiden (Sam Rockwell) who promises survival — and maybe romance.  However, the archetypes here have shifted. Elly is no sharp-tongued Kathleen Turner heroine, and Rockwell doesn’t have the swagger of '80s Douglas. He’s less rugged and more world-weary. Playing a spy who is less Bond and more beach bum, Rockwell frequently looks like he's sleepwalking or desperately bored, while Howard is often reduced to wide-eyed alarm and tiresome whining as an author plunged into a world she's only experienced behind her laptop. The pair don't have any sexual chemistry, so when the plot inevitably throws Elly and Aiden together into a sultry dance number, something crucial is missing.  As demanded of spy movies, Vaughn's latest will take audiences around the globe to exotic and gorgeous locations, wreaking carnage along the way. But in the wake of truly gonzo action movies like the Mission: Impossible and Fast and Furious franchises, Vaughn's opening gambit of spy schtick — as seen in the trailer — feels a pale imitation, even if it is bolstered by big stars like Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena. You see, Argylle not only shows us Elly's actual adventure with scruffy spy Aiden, but also the imagined adventures of her titular fictional spy: the debonair Agent Argylle, played by the Witcher star, wearing the worst haircut we've seen him in yet — a strangely square buzz cut that looks like he pissed off his barber.  It should be fun to watch the rumpled world of Rockwell's real-world spy intercut with Elly's glossier Argylle facing similar version of events as they unfold, with Cavill and Rockwell enacting the very same stunts in their different styles. But the bit gets old fast, in part because the Argylle character is woefully one-note. He’s all swagger, one-liners, and winks, whereas Rockwell's Aiden seems bored and beleaguered, whether he's taking down assassins or delivering a tutorial about how to crush a human skull. It's a superficial (though solid) contrast, but its impact dulls in repetition.  As Elly gets into the action, there's promise for a new turn. But frankly, what should be Argylle's most bonkers bits feel woefully underwhelming. Blame the lack of chemistry between its leads. Blame the fact that Vaughn rips off Birds of Prey, from a colorful smoke-bombed raid to cheeky dance-inspired action. Blame a soundtrack that favors '70s disco and slow love songs to score fight scenes, seemingly aiming for Guardians of the Galaxy or Kingsmen but actually undercutting their stakes and energy. But most of all, blame that Vaughn has no concept of what women want in action heroines.  The premise of an everywoman getting swept into espionage, intrigue, and romance is a trusted formula for thrilling female audiences. However, Elly is less everywoman and more infantilized; she freaks out at any spy-level action, her only friend is her mom (an underused Catherine O'Hara), and her only loves are her writing and her cat, Alfie. Mostly confined to Elly's backpack, the Scottish Fold fur baby is basically a Disney princess sidekick, cute and cuddly and — on rare occasions — relevant to the plot. Perhaps this is by design, with the PG-13 rating aiming to appeal to the many young women who contributed to making Barbie a blockbuster. But Barbie was more than a dazzling fantasy... and Argylle isn't even dazzling.  The fashion fantasy that Barbie, The Lost City, and even the Tom Cruise movies offer women is woefully missed here. The fancy costumes in Argylle feel cartoonish more than glamorous. And in the real world, when Elly strives to live up to her fantasy on a mission, the result is an evening dress that fits like a dream but with a color that feels juvenile, along with an inexplicable haircut. She seems uncomfortable in it, as if she's in costume rather than living her dream. So, when she begins pulling off big action moves, it's missing the thrill of Harley Quinn cutting loose in cool clothes that are made to move — and kick ass — in.  The only time Argylle comes close to working is when it embraces the absurdities of spies dancing. Specifically, the ""whirly bird"" is superb. Here, one dancer hoists his partner into the air, her legs outstretched over his shoulders, her crotch at his face, and they spin, gracefully, defying physics and slyly simulating cunnilingus. This is as close as Argylle gets to a sex joke. And it's also the closest it gets to realizing its own potential to be silly and sexy. Elsewhere, dance is bonded to violence, but it doesn't stick the landing the way this running gag does.  Argylle is not fun enough to pull this off. Instead, it offers romance ruined by a lack of sex appeal, jokes that hit as hard as an infant might, and action doubly undermined by bewildering music choices and pulled punches — possibly because of the restraints of PG-13. (Notably, the killer doll slasher M3GAN managed to be jaw-droppingly violent with such a rating!) And worst of all, it is unforgivably long, belabored by plot twists.  Many of these turns and double-crosses are telegraphed so intensely that it feels wrong to call them a twist. Others involve barely established characters, and so carry all the emotional weight of a wiffle ball. Still others seem to exist to just drag out the third act for another action sequence. The actual runtime of this movie is two hours and 19 minutes, but midway through I began to wonder how long I’d been in the theater, waiting — pining — to laugh or feel a thrill. Had it been three hours? Four? A thousand!?  Vaughn's other crime is in casting. On paper, this supporting lineup is stellar: In addition to the aforementioned Cavill, Cena, Lipa, and O'Hara, the cast includes Ariana DeBose, Bryan Cranston, Rob Delaney, and Samuel L. Jackson. But in execution, it’s a disaster. Fuchs's script gives Cranston criminally cliched bad guy speeches, which the Breaking Bad star growls through with nowhere to go. O'Hara is wasted in a role without punchlines, as is Delaney. And the rest of the cast, from Lipa's glitzy LaGrange to Cena's tough guy Wyatt, are handed one-note characters who offer little more than the opportunity to cameo.  While there are some fun bits in Argylle, the whole is far less than the sum of its parts. So in the end, much like The Flash, this action movie feels less fun and more like a punishment. Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.

"Feb 7, 2024",negative," *** Orion and the Dark is an animated kids movie penned by Charlie Kaufman, who is known for writing offbeat dramas like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Based on the book of the same name by Emma Yarlett, Kaufman’s script follows a boy named Orion (Jacob Tremblay) who is afraid of everything. The night before a school field trip, Orion meets his biggest fear: the Dark (Paul Walter Hauser), who joins him on a journey that forces Orion to face and learn from his fears. While Orion and the Dark is kiddie fare, Kaufman does manage to squeeze in some jokes aimed at adults (children likely won’t understand the nods to David Foster Wallace and Werner Herzog), while director Sean Charmatz brings Kaufman’s script to life in colorful ways (including when Orion’s drawings of his fears come flying off the pages of his sketchbook). Some of the characters’ facial animations look dated, but Charmatz’s stylistic choices are enjoyable overall. Orion and the Dark is no Inside Out or Soul, but it’s still an entertaining exploration of Orion’s vivid inner life. TV-Y7. DANIEL RESTER. Netflix. **** In Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s 2018 masterpiece Shoplifters, a father tells his son, “All men like boobs.” It’s a cringe-y declaration, but hardly evidence of bigotry. The father, a scrappy shoplifter, doesn’t hate gay people; he just isn’t worldly enough to consider that his son might be one. In retrospect, the moment plays like a prelude to Monster, in which Kore-eda crafts an exquisite portrait of queer love that gradually comes into focus. A time-shifting tale of anguished parents, desperate teachers, and barely knowable youths, Monster is a beautifully slippery creation. While the film is populated with tragically well-meaning grown-ups, it is two boys, Minato and Yori (Soya Kurokawa and Hinata Hiiragi), who get the last word—or note, rather. As Minato and Yori flee the confinement and compromises of the adult world, the film’s score punctuates their escape with a beautifully delicate piano melody by Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died of cancer last year. In 2021, Sakamoto wrote, “I am hoping to make music for a little while longer.” So he did, writing a score that captures the lyrical essence of first love. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Living Room. **** Astoria becomes an extension of a young woman’s soul in Sometimes I Think About Dying, an exquisitely restrained drama from director Rachel Lambert. Rey Skywalker herself, Daisy Ridley, plays Fran, a numb office worker who sits rigidly in her cubicle, silently terrified of being forced to engage in pleasantries. With eerie grace, Sometimes I Think About Dying peers into Fran’s suicidal visions—she imagines herself entombed in a tangle of driftwood on a desolate beach—but even as the film evokes the monotony of her depression, it gleams in moments of connection. An unexpected friendship with a hyperactive, pie-munching co-worker (Dave Merheje) leads Fran to a murder mystery party, where she delights the guests by flamboyantly miming death by acid. Fran is never more alive than when she yanks death from the darkened crevices of her mind and plays it as farce, an act that draws her more deeply into a city and its people. Sometimes I Think About Dying is unmistakably an Astorian movie—only in a close-knit community could a character give directions to their home by saying it’s behind “the purple house”—but its emotional reach goes beyond the sweep of the Columbia River, which to Fran seems both an empty void and an inviting canvas. Sometimes she thinks about living. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Fox Tower. *** Cady Heron, the corrupted innocent; Regina George, the diabolically perfect teen dictator. As mythic as they are backstabbing, the characters of Mean Girls have clung to pop culture for 20 years, infiltrating the English language (“fetch” happened, y’all) and solidifying our collective imagining of American high schools as battlefields littered with the corpses of dead friendships. Some would have you believe that the original 2004 film was a righteous lesson in the evils of bullying, but it reveled in Regina’s rampant cruelty and her blunt-force comeuppance (though she took being pummeled by a school bus like a champ). However, the new musical version of the story—based on the 2017 stage musical the film inspired—is noticeably nice. Gone are the mysteriousness of Cady and Regina’s reconciliation (they now share a bathroom heart-to-heart instead of a dreamy, wordless truce) and the horrifying scene in which a student is sexually abused by Coach Carr (now played by Jon Hamm as a wholesome dumbass). Fans will debate whether Mean Girls ‘24 is a welcome refresh or a dishonest gloss on an inherently ugly tale, but at least two of the songs (“Revenge Party” and “Apex Predator”) come respectably close to being bangers, and the new cast (led by Angourie Rice as Cady and Reneé Rapp as Regina) is surprisingly serviceable. Filling a role originated by Lindsay Lohan or Rachel McAdams without embarrassing yourself? That really is fetch. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

Her laughter is neither mad nor maniacal; it’s a titter of amusement, light and bloodless. Hedwig may be the wife of Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), but she doesn’t fit the profile of a tyrant’s spouse. At once aware and indifferent, she regards the genocide of Jews with mild interest, preferring to focus on the sunflowers and kale growing in her meticulously maintained yard. Hedwig is one of many clues that Jonathan Glazer, the writer-director of The Zone of Interest, is less interested in the banality than the triviality of evil. When movies peer through German eyes at World War II, they typically cling to the momentous, from the 1,200 lives saved by Oskar Schindler to the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Hitler with a bomb in a briefcase. What fascinates Glazer, adapting Martin Amis’ novel, are the seemingly incidental details, like the Höss family’s pond freezing over or Rudolf petting a gray-furred dog on a snowy day. The quiet spectacle of ordinary life marching on in the shadow of the Holocaust makes you want to scream in helpless rage, an outcome Glazer stiffly guards against. He has no catharsis to offer, no words of wisdom to impart. His singular drive is to show us that horrific history is made not only by raging monsters, but by men and women who treat the slaughter of millions as another day at the office. And not even an extraordinary day. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, Clackamas, Hollywood. ** If there’s one word to describe Argylle, it’s “indecisive.” There’s clever ideas at play, and at times the film is outright spectacular, but director Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman, X-Men: First Class) and screenwriter Jason Fuchs seem incapable of picking just one tone, tangent or trajectory to follow. The film starts as Romancing the Stone meets The Bourne Identity, as mild-mannered spy-fi novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) becomes the target of actual secret agents when her latest manuscript reads too much like an active black-ops case. There’s fun to be had with the contrast between Elly’s clean-cut protagonist Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill) and the uncouth spy who protects her, Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), but a midpoint twist upends the whole excursion and sends Elly on a divergent emotional journey that easily could have taken up the whole runtime. Vaughn can’t decide if he’s making another twisted James Bond spoof like Kingsman or a sincere ode to bombastic ‘80s thrillers, but he remains unimpeachable as an action director, delivering fight scenes that range from the creative to the ludicrous (all while Howard and Rockwell share fabulous rom-com rapport). Argylle strains under the weight of its ambitions, but if Vaughn’s irreverent charm is your thing, it’ll leave you shaken and stirred. PG-13. MORGAN SHAUNETTE. Cedar Hills, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Evergreen Parkway, Fox Tower, Laurelhurst, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Mill Plain, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, Progress Ridge, St. Johns Twin, Studio One. ** A claustrophobic setting and six characters make up this chamber piece/thriller from director Gabriela Cowperthwaite (Blackfish, Megan Leavey). Three Americans and three Russians are working together on the International Space Station when an explosive conflict breaks out on Earth—and both teams soon get communications from their respective governments to take control of the station by any means necessary. I.S.S. begins efficiently as Cowperthwaite establishes the characters’ tension and hesitation. She’s blessed with a strong cast, including Chris Messina, John Gallagher Jr., and Pilou Asbæk (though lead Ariana DeBose feels a bit out of place). Unfortunately, I.S.S. becomes more mechanical in execution—and the characters’ decisions grow more unbelievable—in the second act, and screenwriter Nick Shafir never fully explores the political complications promised by the setup. I.S.S. is decent enough, but Shafir and Cowperthwaite should have injected more edge into the material and taken notes from Alfred Hitchcock’s Lifeboat. R. DANIEL RESTER.

"Feb 7, 2024",neutral," Antes de ver “Argylle: Agente secreto”, de Matthew Vaughn, hay algo que debes saber: el argumento intenta reimaginar uno de los sucesos más curiosos de la cultura pop actual. En el 2020, la autora Elly Conway se hizo famosa por su primer libro. Tanto, como para que Apple TV+ se apresurara a comprar los derechos de Argylle, la historia de un espía que arriesga la vida en un terreno complicado. Pero nadie sabe la identidad real de la autora. El seudónimo oculta — al parecer — a una estadounidense joven que escribió su libro debut sentada en una cafetería y ¡milagro entre milagros!, se hizo famosa de la noche a la mañana.  Tampoco está claro si eso es cierto o no. Mucho se dice y nada se sabe de Elly Conway. Las especulaciones llegan al punto de decir que detrás de ese seudónimo está Taylor Swift. La cuestión es que la identidad de este éxito de masas está en debate y parte de eso llega a la adaptación del director Matthew Vaughn (“Kingsman: El servicio secreto”). Durante su primera media hora, la película juega con la idea que todo lo que se ve en pantalla en realidad es un frío resabido de lo que ocurre con un misterio público. Incluso, que esa noción sobre lo verídico — y lo que no lo es — sostiene el argumento de la película. ¿Es cierto este enigma a dos bandas, una de una escritura que se oculta en un nombre falso y su implicación con el espionaje? ¿Se trata de un juego imaginativo de triples y cuádruples dimensiones? La idea sugerente del realismo pop encauzado a través del cine a un público total, se desvanece, mientras un Henry Cavill con cara de circunstancias — la misma de siempre — baila con una debutante Dua Lipa, con peluca rubia para la ocasión. Pero lo realmente intrigante de la película y lo que se pierde es ese guiño a un secreto que no lo es tanto. O en el mejor de los casos, que en realidad sólo son líneas que se unen entre sí para narrar una historia de acción socorrida. Lo sentimos Matthew Vaughn, ya nos conocemos todos y cada uno de tus trucos. “The Matrix Resurrections” fue un desastre de crítica y de taquilla que golpeó en el orgullo a los millones de fanáticos que esperaban el regreso de Neo (Keanu Reeves, todavía disfrazado de John Wick), para mayor gloria de la ciencia ficción. Lana Wachowski tomó la decisión de convertir su saga en el ombligo de su propio mundo y apostó fuerte a hacerse referencias directas. Tanto, como para que la primera hora de la cinta — la mejor y la que se recordará, sin duda — fuera un juego en un salón de espejos incómodos. ¿Fue Neo la invención de un anciano programador que vivió sus mejores ideas y ahora delira al borde de la caída psicótica? Mientras el argumento se mantuvo en ese listón, fue brillante. Cuando cayó en un delirio místico de resurrecciones se volvió común y muy cerca de lo mediocre. Lo mismo ocurrió con la enésima versión de “Scream”, en la que los protagonistas se parodian a sí mismos y hasta tienen una serie de películas que, a su vez, se burlan de su condición de víctimas. Los directores Matt Bettinelli-Olpin y Tyler Gillett llevaron los límites de ese universo a la forma en que se desarrolla el laberinto de crímenes que culmina con la revelación. El nuevo asesino procede directamente de la primera película y el original grupo de sobrevivientes. En “Argylle: Agente secreto”, Matthew Vaughn lo intenta también y razones no le faltan. El chisme de la escritora sin nombre, que es exitosa y además, podría ser la estrella de moda, así lo reclama. Pero Vaughn, que parodió hasta el cansancio el género de espías en su trilogía Kingsman, no sabe muy bien qué hacer con este acertijo que se parece mucho a varias películas. A Vaughn le falta sutileza. La Elly Conway del argumento (Bryce Dallas Howard), es la autora misma. O su esencia, en cualquier caso. En «Argylle: Agente secreto», el personaje ya ha escrito cuatro libros de su saga del espía sospechosamente parecido a Superman y va por el quinto, cuando algo inaudito ocurre: las tramas que imagina comienzan a suceder en la vida real y ella parece ser el centro de una conspiración. El truco es una delicia y la actriz logra ser convincente al interpretar a una mujer posiblemente real, en medio de sus sueños más descabellados. Pero de nuevo, el problema es el director, que desea mostrar a Henry Cavill como un 007 en versión AliExpress o lucirse con la larga lista de cameos de lujo que hacen de la película un disfrute para el cinéfilo: John Cena, Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston… Sin embargo, la cinta, que pudo ser muchas cosas a la vez, en realidad se queda corta. Se conforma con tiroteos y números de bailes sincronizados con balas, lo que resulta una decepción si se esperaba algo más. Ni la sonrisa torcida y atractiva de Henry Cavill permiten apostar a que veremos de nuevo a Elly, con su gato a cuestas, salvando al mundo y a occidente. Lo más probable es que esta cinta, que pudo ser el inicio de un mundo en desarrollo en dos bandas — en la literatura y en el cine — se quede a medias. Todo porque su director, quería mostrar a Dua Lipa bailando y lista para matar. Y a Chip, el gato de Claudia Schiffer. Lo entendemos… pero no es suficiente.¿O sí?"
"Feb 7, 2024",negative," Matthew Vaughn is back with would-be action franchise starter Argylle. All the ingredients for a fun time are here, but it’s far too long and convoluted for its own good, writes Travis Johnson. Inside director Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle there’s a fun, brisk romantic action comedy screaming to get out. You might have to listen carefully, though; there’s a lot of bloat in the way. Some of that is down to the bête noire of modern filmmaking, which is franchise-first thinking—Argylle is supposed to set up a sprawling espionage shared universe that encompasses itself, Vaughn’s Kingsman series, and a third, secret thing. But in trying to tip the first domino in the line, Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs (Pan) succumb to self-indulgence. Argylle has moments, scenes, little bits of business that really pop, but they’re mired in a plodding script that often comes across as smug rather than sly. All other considerations aside, the 139-minute running time is a big ask—some emergency surgery to get this thing down to a tight 100 would work wonders. Which is a shame, because all the ingredients for a fun time are here. A riff on Romancing the Stone, which already serviced as inspo for the recent The Lost City, Argylle sees a dowdied-down Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway, spy thriller novelist and doting fur-mama to her cat, Alfie. Her hit series follows the exploits of superspy Argylle (Henry Cavill and, making a welcome return to the screen, Schwarzenegger’s haircut from Commando), essentially a James Bond dropped into a Mission: Impossible story. In real life, however, she’s anxious, lonely, and under the thumb of her cheerfully domineering mother (Catherine O’Hara, who can do this stock role in her sleep). Things change, however, when she encounters a real spy, Sam Rockwell’s Aiden, on an interstate train trip, and he’s nowhere near as suave as ol’ Argylle. He’s a dab hand at fighting off the wave of assassins that show up, though, and so Elly is now on a jet-setting jaunt with the affable Aiden, with Alfie along for the ride. Why her? Good question. Shame about the answer. Far too convoluted for its own good, Argylle lurches from set piece to set piece, and while the action is generally very good and the chemistry between our two leads is palpable, it’s hard to really care about what’s going on. The M:I films have taught us that plot can be largely irrelevant, but stakes still matter—Ethan Hunt is out to save the world. Argylle is low stakes but lacks the dexterity to still be engaging. You can see Rockwell struggling to elevate the material he’s been given to work with, while Howard is stuck with a deer-in-the-headlights expression for most of her screen time, until later developments (which we won’t spoil) see her thrust directly into the action. There’s a lot going on in Argylle, but perhaps too much. A good actioner should leave us breathless, not exhausted. There’s fun to be had, sure. The supporting cast, including Bryan Cranston as Elly’s dad, and John Cena, Dua Lipa, and Richard E. Grant as various characters in the fictional Argylle universe, plus Samuel L. Jackson and Sofia Boutella briefly cropping up in the “real” world, are pretty great but sparsely used. There’s a scattering of genuinely surprising and impressive action gags—Vaughn loves and respects action choreography, and that’s readily apparent here. But at the end of the day, Argylle feels like an overly long example of the sort of big budget but instantly forgettable action fodder that Netflix cranks out on the reg, and not the foundation of a new and exciting cinematic universe. It barely functions as a stand-alone movie. It should be noted that this is an Apple TV+ production, and your best course of action might be to check it out when it eventually drops there."
"Feb 7, 2024",positive," From spy novels come to life to reanimated corpses, Pop Culture Planet’s Kristen Maldonado shares the movies you don’t want to miss… and the ones you can skip. In Argylle, Bryce Dallas Howard plays reclusive author Elly Conway who writes best-selling spy novels about a secret agent named Argylle. But things take a turn when her books start to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization. Now she’s thrust into a world where fiction and reality has blurred. I recommend going into Argylle with as little information as possible. All I’ll say is Argylle will constantly have you on the edge of your seat. When you think Matthew Vaughn has taken things as far as they can go, he turns it up another level! With so many shocking twists and ridiculously laugh out loud moments, you’re sure to have a blast! In Zelda Williams’ directorial debut Lisa Frankenstein, Kathryn Newton is a misunderstood teen who embarks on a murderous adventure with a reanimated corpse (Cole Sprouse) to find love and missing body parts. The aesthetic of Lisa Frankenstein is electric, with inspiration from Weird Science and Tim Burton. The cast is top tier and the costumes and sets perfectly embody an 80s neon fever dream. Cole Sprouse shows off up his physical comedy chops, while Liza Soberano is a stand out as the surprisingly cool and kind step sister. Unfortunately, the story wasn’t there. It felt disconnected with dragged out scenes that don’t go far enough into the horror or camp. Camila Mendes plays Ana Santos, an art gallery intern who is invited on a last-minute work trip to London with her demanding boss in Upgraded. When she gets upgraded to a first class seat thanks to a generous airport attendant, she meets a handsome stranger Will (Archie Renaux) who mistakes her for the boss of her company. It leads her on a whirlwind adventure full of romance, art, and lies.  This case of mistaken identity is a ton of fun as Mendes has great counterparts to work opposite. There’s her challenging boss Claire Dupont played by Marisa Tomei with her mean girl assistants, her sister (Aimee Carrero) and her fiancé (Andrew Schulz) who are desperate to get her out of their apartment, and the rich but humble Will and his famous mother Catherine (Lena Olin). Mendes and Renaux’s chemistry is sweet and charming, while the supporting cast bring the humor. Tomei and her minions channel a Devil Wears Prada-energy that makes for an instant rom-com classic, but the real highlight is the strong female empowerment between Ana, Claire, and Catherine. They uplift and support one another and see the potential in each other to succeed. Following her feature directorial debut with the dark and twisted The Blazing World, director Carlson Young proves she’s got the range and chops to tackle any genre.

"Feb 7, 2024",negative," One of the big stories from the world of cinema is the disastrous opening for Argylle, the spy comedy from the director of the Kingsman films and X-Men: First Class. Despite an all-star cast, mega budget, and huge advertising push, the film has flopped at the box office and is predicted by many to sustain a nine-figure loss.  Not even the entirely false suggestion that the spy novel it’s based upon was written by Taylor Swift was enough to convince people to visit cinemas. So, is it as bad as the numbers suggest? Bryce Dallas Howard grins and bears it as Elly Conway, the author of a popular series of spy novels featuring the suave protagonist Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill). Fact and fiction intersect when Elly is attacked on a train and rescued by a real spy (Sam Rockwell), who reveals that her books are actually predicting real life incidents, making her the target of an evil terrorist organisation.  Following a similar pattern to Kingman (outsider enters a secretive spy world), the film sadly becomes more tedious as the time rolls on. The viewer is beaten into submission with pointless twists that over complicate the story and make the mission feel like a chore. The high production values are undermined by elements that don’t particularly work, such as Cavill appearing in Elly’s subconscious, or numerous gags involving her cat. Nothing comes together in a satisfying way, and at around two hours twenty minutes those weaknesses add up.  Rockwell and Howard are fun as the odd couple outrunning bullets, while Bryan Cranston is over the top as the villain, Ritter. The characters who exist in Elly’s books are great to watch, but it feels like a waste of big stars such as Cavill and John Cena, given they only appear sporadically. The highly publicised appearance of a certain pop star (not that one!) is even more confusing, given it’s barely more than a glamorous cameo.  There are worse films than Argylle, but few that were more costly to produce. The proposed beginning of a trilogy, it’s difficult to see what would make the few people who have seen this in cinemas come back for more. In the world of action, there’s no bigger crime than being dull."
"Feb 7, 2024",negative," ARGYLLE. With Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson. Written by Jason Fuchs. Directed by Matthew Vaughn. Rated PG-13 for strong violence and action and some strong language. 139 minutes. In theaters. A $200 million budget and they couldn’t spring for an actual cat. As most readers have probably ascertained from the maddeningly ubiquitous marketing campaign, Matthew Vaughn’s enervating espionage romp ARGYLLE co-stars a fuzzy grey feline named Alfie, who spends the film primarily consigned to a backpack worn by Bryce Dallas Howard. (The carrier has a little plastic porthole so the filmmakers can keep cutting to cat reaction shots that aren’t nearly as cute as the movie seems to think they are.) It should go without saying that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie, as I don’t think any animals were photographed. Alfie is a janky CGI creation out of cheapo kids films like “Garfield: A Tale Of Two Kitties,” and a fitting mascot for a movie in which everything appears disconcertingly artificial. Filmed in 2021, “Argylle” is the most Covid-looking of Covid era movies. There are seldom more than two performers in any given scene, usually standing in front of cavernously empty backgrounds that all seem to share the same eerily still, plasticky sheen. (The volume screen production model might be a technical miracle, yet it remains incapable of convincingly depicting people being outside.) This uncanny valley effect works strangely in the movie’s favor during the opening sequence, which cheekily parodies the popular spy novels penned by the protagonist, with Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa spouting self-consciously cliched lines like “You and I are not so different,” before taking part in absurd stunts that defy all known laws of physics. Cavill’s Agent Argylle is the signature creation of Howard’s shy, self-effacing cat lady Elly Conway, a former figure skater who started a second career as a spy novelist after suffering a nasty bump on the head. The thing about Elly’s books is that they’re full of top secret shenanigans that keep actually happening, which has got not just the CIA but also assorted other shady characters extremely interested in what she’s cooked up for the next installment. (Weirdly, her novels are numbered like movie sequels, i.e. “Argylle 5,” which bears no resemblance to how actual books are published. Imagine sitting down to read “Jack Reacher 42” or “James Bond 316.”) She’s rescued-slash-abducted by an irritable operative played by Sam Rockwell in a performance that initially makes no sense whatsoever, in an action scene that feels like a knockoff of the already bad movie “Bullet Train” (except twice as long). The first hour or so of “Argylle” is dreadful, building to a “shocking” reveal that should already be obvious to anyone who’s seen a movie before. (Especially anyone who’s seen a certain ‘90s action movie scripted by Shane Black. Right down to the ice skates.) But since the ads implore us not to “let the cat out of the bag,” I’ll play along and avoid specifics. Safe to say that the film improves considerably after the mid-movie revelation of the real agent Argylle, with Rockwell allowed to evince an endearing, lovesick charm once he’s no longer burdened with having to con the audience. He and Howard come to have such terrific chemistry you resent the reels wasted on their bickering. (Most of the movie’s problems could have been solved by tossing the extraneous trickery and moving the twist – which is where the story actually starts – to the front. This also would have gotten me home before midnight.) “Argylle” gets better the more it embraces the cartoonishness of its premise, as the pervasive unreality of the film’s visual design lends itself to the outlandish action scenes that are director Vaughn’s forte. The extreme laddishness and rude boy excesses of his “Kick-Ass” and “Kingsman” pictures have been toned down to PG-13 levels, but Vaughn still racks up quite the body count during a wild skating extravaganza. Rockwell remains one of the best dancers in movies – the joy he takes in movement is infectious – and lord knows the lousy movie musicals we’ve been seeing lately could use someone like him. But I guess we’ll have to settle for a balletically lethal display of his dance prowess, the moment in this movie when I finally surrendered and started smiling. Too bad it doesn’t arrive until the third act. In a choice that can only be described as bizarre, the love theme to “Argylle” is “Now and Then,” the AI-assisted, zombie Beatles cash-grab single released in November 2023 that made everybody kind of uncomfortable for a few minutes before we all went back to listening to “Abbey Road.” Two characters in the film who haven’t seen each other for five years talk about how they used to dance to the tune way back when they were stationed in Mogadishu, which is a weird thing to say about a song that didn’t exist yet when the scene was shot. The melody – what little there is of it – has been incorporated into Lorne Balfe’s score throughout the film.  Over the past two decades, Sean Burns’ reviews, interviews, and essays have appeared in WBUR’s The ARTery, Philadelphia Weekly, The Improper Bostonian, Metro, The Village Voice, Nashville Scene and RogerEbert.com.

"Feb 7, 2024",positive," ARGYLLE *** (139 minutes) M
Much-hyped but scarcely previewed, Argylle lands as a fun, clever, twist-charged espionage action-comedy about a best-selling spy novel writer (Bryce Dallas Howard) who discovers that her fiction is seeping into reality.  Starring Henry Cavill (Superman) as her fictional hero Argylle and Sam Rockwell as an IRL spy, the heightened, knockabout lark is front-loaded with lots of well-staged, cutely improbable action bouncing off a progressively loopy plot where things constantly change. Director Matthew Vaughn (who gave us the King’s Man films) does a solid job with the featherweight mock-Bond shenanigans, though matters do veer into outright silliness, especially towards the climax. One big mystery surrounding Argylle (set to stream on AppleTV+) is why such an innocuous piece of throwaway action-comedy nonsense has attracted such critical venom. The thing has been hated upon without relent. Go figure.  FORCE OF NATURE: THE DRY 2 ** (112 minutes) M
In Force of Nature, the hugely anticipated, rapidly made follow-up to the hit 2020 Australian film The Dry, five white-collar women head into the wild woods. As a corporate team-building exercise it doesn’t work out so well, with lots of friction and bickering leading to only four of them returning to the nicely located tourist hotel with the scenic views.  Enter – or rather, re-enter – detective Aaron Falk (Eric Bana, also a producer) who heads into the wet, foreboding forest (along with every other police office in the area, it seems) to suss out what happened and why. Regrettably, the mystery doesn’t turn out to be all-that-compelling or all-that-thrilling; there are some strong performances, especially from Deborra-Lee Furness, and plenty of strong atmospherics but the story – again based on a novel by Jane Harper – is rather rickety. One of the film’s persistent irritations is how heavily the plot relies on coincidence, clumsiness and happenstance. You also need to hand the film a big pass as to how five presumably intelligent women could get so bamboozled in a forest full of trails and signage. As for Falk, he spends far too much time in the comfy confines of the hotel and not enough out in the rough trying to get to the bottom of things. Again directed and written by Robert Connolly – no question one of the best filmmakers in the country – Force of Nature can’t quite generate the tension or killer moments we got in The Dry.  That said, Force of Nature deserves credit for being that rarest of all beasts – namely, an Australian film that people have actually been looking forward to seeing.  ANATOMY OF A FALL *** (152 minutes) MA
Devotees of courtroom intrigue will be sated by the engrossing drama of Anatomy of a Fall, a crime mystery (nominated for five Oscars) that’ll keep you guessing across its generous running time. The dark deed occurs at a fashionably remote French chalet where a famous writer (Sandra Hüller) has her life turned inside out when her husband apparently falls from the third-floor balcony, hits a shed and lands face-down in the snow, dead. She’s distressed at the discovery – but as investigators peel back the circumstances of the incident suspicions are roused over whether the claim it was a tragic accident are plausible. Like most courtroom dramas there are loads of extended flashbacks here, and while the film runs long, the exceptional lead performance from Hüller holds it together. ALL OF US STRANGERS *** (105 minutes) MA
The manner in which grief can embed itself into one’s life is given vivid, unnerving focus by writer/director Andrew Haigh (45 Years) in the beguiling All of Us Strangers. The sad sod at the centre of this delicately drawn psychodrama is Adam (Andrew Scott), a lonely guy living in a new, all-but-vacant London apartment building with nothing but the pain of having lost his parents decades earlier. After getting involved with Harry (Paul Mescal), apparently the only other occupant in the building, Adam visits his old suburban home, only to discover his parents (Claire Foy and Jamie Bell) happily living there.  Are they ghosts? Or has Adam’s innocent trip on public transport taken him through a mystical portal across space-time designed specifically to deliver unto him the joys of the loving parental embrace denied him for so long? Along with the explorations of love, loss and grief, Haigh also offers us a look inside the mind of someone whose hold on reality has become unshackled. One scene involving a collision of perception is deeply affecting."
"Feb 6, 2024",negative,"Argylle takes all the spy/espionage tropes and supercharges it for this movie. It's predictable but fun - up to the third act, where certain gags and scenes took longer than necessary, and lost steam. Sam Rockwell is the one to watch in this. "
"Feb 6, 2024",negative," In 2006, Will Ferrell gave a bravura performance (his best) in Stranger than Fiction) playing an unwitting, unwilling character in a novel being written by another person. Here, director Matthew Vaughn takes a then-unpublished manuscript by Elly Conway, apparently changes it substantially, turning it into a vague comedic imitation of Ferrell’s movie. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Conway, a publicity shy author of a series of successful espionage books who suddenly becomes involved in real life events mirroring her novels. Unfortunately, unlike Ferrell’s ‘Fiction, Vaughn’s movie (written by Jason Fuchs) is convoluted and absurd; it’s like slapstick or (probably unintended) satire. Conway gets involved in fights between protagonists Aidin (Sam Rockwell) and others who are out to do no good and to kill her, to her puzzlement. The “fights” are confusing and even more bizarre than most of the silly fights in today’s Hollywood, as the combatants interchange between Conway’s fictional hero, Argylle (Henry Cavill) to Aidin in the blink of an eye, back and forth. It’s enough to make one dizzy, after they ask “Whaaaat?” If you hang around to the end of this far too long movie (which I don’t advise), the convolution is explained. But not before more fights and a final segue onto a mega tanker ship that is so clumsy it boggles and befuddles the mind. Howard is woefully miscast as a martial arts heroine as her zaftig physique (5-7, 139) makes her fighting scenes unintentionally laughable. The supporting cast is impressive for such a disappointing movie, including Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, John Cena, and the always entertaining Samuel L. Jackson in a cameo.

"Feb 6, 2024",positive,This is the most fun a Matthew Vaughn film has been for a very long time. 
"Feb 6, 2024",negative," From the jump, director Matthew Vaughn’s (Kingsman, Kick-Ass) Argylle explodes into a fizz-bang ball of inanity. But as juvenile humor and groan-worthy puns coat every spit-shined surface, and plot points reach for spy tropes over and over again—not for the sake of spoofing, but as devices laying around for Vaughn and writer Jason Fuchs to pluck and rehash—the movie feels lazily written, almost incidental. A downloading bar stuck at 94%? Check. A speedboat getaway? Check. Main leads trapped on a rooftop, memory loss, and mind control? Check, check, and check. This isn’t satire, folks. It’s just painfully predictable. With a meandering plot that feels about as intentional as a series of improv sketches, Argylle whirls with empty theatrics. A campy handheld camera that dizzyingly moves around is supposed to make up for blocky, uninteresting fight choreography—a surprising disappointment, given the exciting action Vaughn’s become known for. Nor can Argylle boast visual splendor; fake-looking backdrops seem to place actors into a permanent green room, while obvious 3D renderings of cars, explosions, and sometimes people add to the sense of watching a cheap, live action cartoon. Finally, a too-long runtime woefully sags in the middle, eliciting drooping eyelids and mid-movie yawns. Without anything to sink your teeth into, there’s just not a great reason to watch Argylle at home, much less in theaters. Although the film does have a female lead, spy novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), Elly spends most of the film utterly powerless—whimpering, scared, and anxious, passing out multiple times.  She does eventually scrabble together a bit of agency, but for the most part, she’s a hollow vessel who listens wide-eyed to the people around her. In particular, love interest Aidan (Sam Rockwell) drags Elly into his chaotic life of espionage, teaching her to become the best version of herself. (Cue groan.) Furthermore, Hollywood consistently pairs significantly older men with younger women, and Argylle falls into that cliche with Howard (42) 13 years younger than Rockwell (55) at the time of the film’s release. Neither does Elly have any real connections with other women. Her mother, played by scene-stealer Catherine O'Hara, is at first supportive of her daughter, but later reveals herself to be unreliable. In minor roles, Sofia Boutella reprises her usual slinky, tall-dark-and-sexy persona (see: Kingsman: The Secret Service, The Mummy), playing an underworld mercenary who trades intel for power. And in the film’s most depressing role for a woman, Dua Lipa’s forced to lean into the demeaning Bond girl trope. To be fair, the campy character is intentionally ridiculous, crafted as an empty assemblage of come-hither stares and innuendo-laced lines. But there’s nothing empowering, or even funny, about watching a hypersexualized woman ramped up to a hundred. It just feels gross. The film cedes its screentime to almost entirely white actors such as Howard, Rockwell, Henry Cavill as Elly’s fictional hero Argylle, O’Hara, and Bryan Cranston as a bland villain. In minor roles, Samuel L. Jackson plays a seldom-seen CIA director, reminiscent of so many other tokenized Black characters in supposed positions of power who defer to white protagonists to save the day. French Algerian actor Boutella appears in the generically labeled “Arabian Peninsula” scenes—a contrast to other regions labeled by their country (“Greece”) or city (“London”). Ariana DeBose gets positive but scant scenes as a tech-savvy spy, and London-born Albanian singer Dua Lipa has the aforementioned lackluster role as a sexpot caricature. The racial diversity is present, just not in any meaningful way. The only area of inclusion where Argylle succeeds is with the centering of a female action hero, Elly, who doesn’t fit the cookie-cutter mold of being thin as a rail. (See: Atomic Blonde’s Charlize Theron, Red Sparrow’s Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Garner in TV series Alias—the list goes on.) The movie does undercut its own positive casting by having every other nameless, gun-toting female spy fall into this exact body shape, but the slightly bigger Elly gets by far the most screen time. It’s refreshing to watch as Elly confidently runs, jumps, and—memorably—spins around on deadly makeshift ice skates, and it’s even more empowering to know that prior to the movie’s production, Howard advocated for herself. She says to Time: “I straight up said to Matthew [Vaughn], ‘I just want you to know that this is my body. And if you want my body to be smaller, I think you should hire someone else.’” It’s dispiriting that someone as beautiful and thin as Howard even needs to have that conversation, but nonetheless, Vaughn made the right decision—Howard’s casting is one of the film’s few bright spots. Even if Argylle does have a female lead who has a slightly bigger body than the usual female action hero, it fails in almost every other area of inclusiveness (and, well, general merit). With writing and direction you could easily mistake for a 10-year-old boy’s fever dream, the film hypersexualizes most of its female spies and barely remembers to include characters of color, all of them tokenized. Sure, plenty of people may well enjoy this lighthearted, don’t-you-dare-take-me-seriously fare. But it could’ve been silly and inclusive without much effort at all."

"Feb 6, 2024",negative," A huge ensemble cast, a James Bond-style mystery, and an adorable looking cat in a backpack - Argylle arrives in theaters with a lot of potential. Incomprehensible to the point of exhaustion, with more twists and turns than a year’s worth of WWE television. Argylle spins itself into oblivion and Vaughn’s 139-minute running time goes unchecked, unedited, and only reigned in by the fact that his movie was cut to pass for a PG-13 and not an R rating. As ridiculous as Matthew Vaughn’s films have become, why wouldn’t I play into that same ridiculousness and begin a review of his latest debacle, Argylle, by quoting Charles Dickens:“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”You see, for a little while, Vaughn’s new 140-minute, Ultimate Slingshot-style spy caper is inventive and fun. A couple of double-crosses land in the first few minutes as secret agent Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill) stumbles around Greece in chase of the beautiful Lagrange (Dua Lipa). They dance, they tease romance, and she pulls out a gun or two and tries to do away with this handsome, “Great Value” James Bond-style wannabe.

En route, she encounters a superfan named Aidan (Sam Rockwell), secretly himself a spy, who rescues Elly from a situation she could never have conceived; she’s become the main character in a real-life spy caper and finds herself in the middle of everything.Okay, let’s call a time out here.

That’s Argylle! Every time you come to and think you know what is happening, the situation changes, the surroundings feel different and you scream internally because each plot twist slingshots you so high into the air, you are no longer having any fun and just want this ride to gently set you back down safely on the ground.I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge Alfie, the Scottish Fold kitty-kat who would steal the show here if so many of his scenes were not basically “Bad CGI Cat Face” moments.

"Feb 6, 2024",negative," When ""Argylle"" first released its trailer, internet sleuths went into overdrive with suspicions that Taylor Swift was, despite her impossibly busy schedule, somehow involved in the project. Elly Conway, the author of the book upon which the film is based, has no media presence and no photo online anywhere. She has given no interviews and generally appears to be a burner persona. The trailer revealed other small details, like the lead's Scottish Fold, the same breed of cat owned by Swift, and the argyle pattern itself she's used before, that drew many Swifties to the belief that Tay Tay was actually Elly Conway. (If you want to read more about it, here’s one article covering the speculation.) I have seen the film, and. No. There does not appear to be any relation between the film and Taylor Swift, apart from those few random signifiers. Hate to break it to you, Swifties, but the multi-hyphenate billionaire hasn't had the time to write and produce a spy-action-comedy in the middle of her world tour and headline-making romance. Lucky for her, she dodged a bullet because ""Argylle,"" despite a few good twists, is not nearly as clever or fun as it tries so hard to project itself to be. Bryce Dallas Howard stars as Elly Conway, a hermit spy novelist thrown into a whirlwind of espionage. She rarely vacates the writing desk in her remote cabin, but she and her cat Alfie, a semi-CGI abomination that mews from the window of her cat pack, are in for an epic adventure. Her successful series of books featuring a dashing, clever spy named Argylle (Henry Cavill) has the eery tendency to portray the real outcomes of actual missions by top secret intelligence agencies. As such, Elly is a wanted woman. So she heads to the train to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) in an attempt to rid herself of writer's block when she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who quickly proves to be the only thing keeping her alive. Aidan acts as her bodyguard, whose mission is to keep Elly out of the hands of a malevolent crime syndicate overseen by the fearsome Bryan Cranston. (I read recently that Cranston has spoken publicly about using Steve Carell's Gru from the ""Despicable Me"" series as inspiration for this character; if nothing tells you that ""Argylle"" is grotesquely over-the-top, it is certainly its lead villain modeling his performance after an animated antagonist from a children's film series.) This cloak-and-dagger agency, known simply as the Division, does not have a clear-cut mission except to be generally evil and malicious, maligned against everything good and right. Both parties - the Division and Aidan's undisclosed affiliation - are vying for the same thumb drive that contains the identity of every member in the Division. With the extra help of Samuel L. Jackson, Elly unwittingly follows the imaginary breadcrumbs that result in the elusive files, as well as the truth about her past.  At least 30 minutes too long, ""Argylle"" was hit by a few bullets itself, and the various holes in its plot were often too frustrating to avoid. Traveling from Colorado to London to France, the film moves fast in theory. In reality, most scenes creep along. By far the film's greatest adversary is its uneven tone and the confusion of its bottom line. If the film is trying to be a satire on the spy thriller, it isn't silly enough to make its point; if it's an earnest attempt to create a film that stands up to the many other well-loved action flicks in that category, it isn't taking itself serious enough to cement its intent with audiences. Howard's general likability as an actress is unparalleled, but her glaringly absent screen chemistry with Rockwell tips the ship enough that, with time (139 minutes to be exact), full submersion is inevitable. If you enjoyed the previous films by director Matthew Vaughn, known for “X-Man: First Class” and the “Kingsman” series, then there is likely something for you here. He has a very particular look that prefers stylized action sequences, lots of camera movements, interesting camera angles and a propensity for CGI. His brand of British action, learned from previous collaborator Guy Ritchie, is thrilling with an unrivaled sense of humor.  There are pockets of that fun in ""Argylle,"" but pockets do not make a shirt. Except for the one big twist that you may not see coming, the others you'll likely spot through a moving train. There are some nifty action sequences, but by the film's end, the camp is nearly intolerable. The story becomes lost to its ludicrous mission and the completely preposterous requirements for the characters to succeed. One such example is Elly figure skating around her foes with the mock skates she made by sticking knives in her shoes; instead of ice, there is a highly flammable layer of liquid crude oil that somehow acts as the perfect alternative to frozen water. She skates around her enemies, taking them out one by one. In the end, gunfire erupts anyway without any explosive reaction by the incendiary substance covering the scene. Which makes the audience wonder: what was the point of that? Again, this isn't to say the film isn't for someone. It has a handful of great scenes and a novel twist. If anything, we can all agree the marketing campaign was top-notch. Would I sit through ""Argylle"" again? No. The older couple next to me didn’t even make it halfway through the runtime before vacating their seats. But maybe it's just not our cup of poison."
"Feb 6, 2024",neutral," English director Matthew Vaughn is best known for making high concept, high octane action movies like “Kick-Ass” and the “Kingsman” series. His new PG-13 rated spy spoof, “Argylle,” now playing in theatres, features his trademarked busy, stylistic action but feels like a toned-down—i.e. less violent, and less provocative—version of his previous work. The chaotic story begins with Bryce Dallas Howard as bestselling but reclusive author Elly Conway. Her life is as sedate as the spy novels she writes are exciting. By day, she sends her main character, globe-trotting super-spy Argylle (Henry Cavill) and sidekicks Wyatt (John Cena) and Kiera (Ariana DeBose), off on adventures to do battle with femme fatale LaGrange (Dua Lipa) in hopes of taking down a global spy syndicate called the Directorate. After work,  she spends quiet time at home with a “hot date,” her beloved cat Alfie (best spy movie cat since Blofeld’s Solomon) by her side. Turns out there is a real Agent Argylle, some very bad people who are after her and Ritter (Bryan Cranston), an unhinged spy master who thinks her books are too close to reality for comfort. Drawn into real-world espionage, she, Aiden and the cat are thrust into a world wilder, and certainly more dangerous, than anything in any of her books. A mix-and-match of “Mission Impossible,” the James Bond franchise and buddy comedies, “Argylle” is a jumbled, confusing bit of semi-fun. Cartoonish and convoluted, the movie is stuffed with over-the-top spy action, a stacked a-listy cast and a wise-cracking, scene-stealing performance from Rockwell, but never quite comes together. Loose ends strangle the story’s forward motion, Vaughn occasionally falls into the movie’s deep plot holes, and there are so many twists, not even Chubby Checker could keep up. It isn’t until the films last half hour, of an over-long 139-minute running time, that Vaughn stages two eye-popping action sequences. A “deadly” dance number and an untraditional figure skating routine are fun, and have the kind of over-the-top energy you expect from Vaughn. Both sequences entertain the eye, but also highlight what the rest of the movie so desperately lacks. Rockwell’s live-wire performance provides most of the film’s laughs, but they are few and far between. As for the rest of the cast, most are underused. And you have to wonder why some of them—including Samuel L. Jackson and Richard E. Grant—even bothered to show up. “Argylle” is errs on the side of PG-13. It is an outrageous, twisty-turny idea trapped in a movie that is afraid to really cut loose.

"Feb 6, 2024",positive," La película “Argylle”, producción de Apple TV Plus y Universal Pictures que llegó a los cines de Puerto Rico esta semana, es lo que sucede cuando un guionista se siente retado por todos los “embustes de película” de las últimas tres secuelas de la franquicia de “Fast and Furious”. La razón principal por la cual la producción no es un desastre insufrible es porque el director, Mathew Vaughn, (”Kicks Ass”, “X-Men First Class”) ha encontrado una docena de formas de divertirse con su concepto central."
"Feb 6, 2024",negative," Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the author of the successful Argylle spy novel series. While promoting her fourth novel, Elly gets writer’s block and is trying to figure out how to end her fifth.  With her pet cat Alfie in tow, Elly takes a train to the city, where she intends to iron out the finale with her mother, Ruth (Catherine O’Hara). On the train, Elly meets a devoted Argylle fan named Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who also claims to be an actual spy. As Aidan takes out the passengers on the entire train, Elly goes back and forth between reality and her imposing and muscular interpretation of Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill). Now the stories Elly has been writing are coming true, as an organization known as The Division, led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston), is searching for the very same Master File that Agent Argylle is tracking in Elly’s books. Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman, Kick-Ass, X-Men: Days of Future Past) and written by Jason Fuchs (Ice Age: Continental Drift, Wonder Woman), Argylle somehow provides everything you love about Matthew Vaughn films while also long overstaying its welcome. Vaughn has described the film as an homage to ’80s action films such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, and that’s understandable. The chemistry between Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell is very Lethal Weapon-esque and is on par with more recent films such as Knight and Day or Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Howard’s ability to cry on command brings the anxious aspect of her character to life, and Rockwell’s palpable charisma is always entertaining. But Argylle falls apart from the first action sequence, overloaded with awkward green screen effects and shoddy CGI. Alfie is noticeably added digitally for the majority of the film. While this makes sense from a “no animals were harmed in the making of this film” perspective, it’s still a floating cat head slapped onto a backpack for most of the film. The film also goes back and forth between the story Elly is writing and what is happening in real life. These two universes eventually collide and start telling the same story but, at first, the Argylle universe is anchored by only actors standing in front of a green screen. To a certain extent, this makes sense, since Elly is consistently changing her mind, and we’re seeing her work it out in real-time. Unfortunately, this is also horrendously ugly. There’s the Kingsman sequence of everyone’s head exploding near the end of the film, and it was enjoyable because the use of special effects matched the longevity of the sequence; in other words, it wasn’t incredibly exaggerated (or maybe it was but only for a short duration). Argylle is that Kingsman exploding head sequence stretched out for 139 minutes. The film drags exponentially, especially in its second half. The dialogue and storyline extend far beyond their means anyway. Elly’s writing seems purposely bad at first, almost like a Stephanie Meyer novel, but you slowly realize that’s how Jason Fuchs writes. The dialogue seems to be written by Mojo Jojo from The Powerpuff Girls — repeatedly verbalizing the same point using similar but slightly different words that hammer a point home; one that was well comprehended by the audience the first go around. While the action is impressive enough at first, it quickly becomes redundant until it’s just completely ridiculous. The train sequence feels like a throwback to the “Freebird” church sequence from the first Kingsman film, without seemingly being done in one take.  It’s a fight sequence done to licensed music with some slow-motion injected at times. This formula is repeated later on in the movie, with more guns and explosions. The film’s end has a multi-colored gas dance sequence between Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell, which somehow sees them shooting enemies and dodging bullets without missing a step or getting shot. The gas also becomes heart-shaped as the two leads get more intimate. Later, Howard slaps some knife blades to her boots and ice skates on crude oil for an absurd sequence that is as weak and wobbly as it sounds. Argylle teases Alfie doing something the entire film: you either expect the feline to attack with its cat-like agility or whip out a gun from its primordial pouch and start blasting. Making matters even worse, this film has to be the most effortless payday Samuel L. Jackson has ever had. He eats a grape, watches basketball, and sits in front of a giant monitor for the extent of his brief appearance. Argylle is an action thriller that willingly wallows in goofy, cringey nonsense. Its writing is immature, and its action is overloaded with sloppy CGI and outrageous concepts that are preposterously frustrating. "
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," Matthew Vaughn definitely has a brand. With the Kingsman franchise and Kick Ass, the British director mostly makes movies that thumb their nose at authority, decency, and restraint. These are loud, over-the-top films with style and bravado. They may not be everyone’s cup of tea (especially with diminishing returns for the Kingsman series), but it’s tough to argue that they’re a weak brew. So even with all of the twists in Argylle, the spy action movie’s biggest surprise may be how utterly bland it is. It isn’t just that Vaughn has made his first PG-13 film in over a decade, though Argylle does feel oddly defanged (or declawed, if you will, given that a cat gets more screen time than most of the famous actors on the poster). There’s just a single use of the f-word (non-sexual, of course), rather than the gleefully foul-mouthed dialogue in Vaughn’s adaptations of Mark Millar’s comics. Argylle’s script from Jason Fuchs (Pan) features so, so many deaths, but the violence is bloodless and boring. It all feels like Vaughn is pulling his punches as much as the characters on screen.  Yet Argylle’s larger sin isn’t its neutered content. The Kingsman films have a growing number of detractors with each release, but they at least feel like they were made by a person. That person was probably an asshole, but at least they were an asshole with a point of view and a knack for worldbuilding (or building out Millar’s world on screen). Those movies were smug but full of verve in both dialogue and visuals, and this is just … there. For almost two-and-a-half hours.  But I digress: there are other things to be mad about in this movie (and in the world as a whole) than just Cavill’s ludicrous coif. Like “Now and Then,” the new (awful) song by … The Beatles that Vaughn plays multiple times. Or the onslaught of jokes that are lucky to get a chuckle. Or wasting a host of talented actors—John Cena, Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, Ariana DeBose, Sofia Boutella, Rob Delaney—in small roles or parts that don’t showcase what they can do. Also, the effects look like shit. At first, the sub-par CGI feels like part of the conceit. Our first big action scene is set in Elly’s book, and it’s easy to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt. She’s writing a cheesy spy novel; maybe it’s supposed to look like this? But as the film progresses and we’re in what is meant to pass for the real world (that bears no resemblance to reality), the effects are cheap and unconvincing. Yet the biggest issue is that Argylle’s various elements have all been done better before, even by Vaughn himself. The Kingsman movies (or at least the first one) were more entertaining takes on the world of espionage. The Lost City and, of course, Romancing the Stone both did the story of a hapless writer caught up in a real adventure in a far more fun way. This is theoretically an original story (wild marketing schemes and conspiratorial nonsense aside), but so little of it feels fresh.  Argylle does have its moments; coasting on the charms of Rockwell and Howard and a few solid sequences gets it far more mileage than it probably deserves. For all its problems, this should be a worse movie, but various elements buoy it from being an absolute drag. Rockwell is a wild card, an ace up the film’s sleeve, but he isn’t enough to eke out a winning hand for Argylle. "
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," You probably shouldn’t listen to me in general, and you really shouldn’t when it comes to movies. Consider the fact that I’m no expert. I’m not a director. I don’t have a degree in film studies. I’m just some guy who’s done some screenwriting and is extremely into movies. And bear in mind that this isn’t an impromptu pity party I’m throwing on my behalf. There’s something more to it. I used to think that some movies, and some tiers of filmmakers, were objectively good. Akira Kurosawa is a genius, and if you feel otherwise, that’s a you problem, not a Kurosawa problem. But you and I both know that’s wrong. The three most subjective things in this world are food, love, and art. To return to Kurosawa for a second, I adore Seven Samurai. You’re not into it? That’s cool!  I mention all of this because it’s important you understand when I’m not in sync with an audience. We’re going to talk about Mathhew Vaughn’s spy-comedy Argyll. If you want to enjoy yourself and have a nice time at the movies, I’d skip reading literally everything beyond the next two sentences. Just know that the odds are good you’ll have a good time with this one and you’ll leave with a nice endorphin rush. We could all use a little of that these days. Still here? We’re introduced to…well, not just a man. More the platonic ideal of a man. The kind of man that men want to be and that women want to be with. When Donald Trump tells his deeply hilarious and one hundred percent full of shit “Sir” stories about strong men crying in front of him? This can only be the kind of man he meant. I am, of course, talking about the world’s greatest spy, Argylle (Henry Cavill).  He’s on a mission in one of those preposterously scenic Greek towns. His objective? To infiltrate a shadowy rogue intelligence agency. To do that, he’ll have to extract information from enemy operative LaGrange (Dua Lipa). Argylle only has his tech guy Wyatt (John Cena), his zero point eight percent body fat, and his precision-trimmed flattop to rely on. There’s also the fact that Argylle isn’t real. He’s the subject of a series of spy novels created by Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard). It helps that Elly is a damn good writer. She meticulously researches intelligence agencies, languages, regions, all in an attempt to create verisimilitude. Elly wants to get it right, with or without the help of her annoying mother, Ruth (Catherine O’Hara) and with the help of her cute-as-a-button Scottish Fold cat Alfie. What doesn’t help is that Elly might be..well, too good a writer. She’s close to finishing her fifth book at her picturesque Colorado home, and while on a train* trip to meet with Ruth, she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell) instead. Turns out the grungy Aiden is a real spy, and it turns out that Elly’s books have an alarming ability to predict the future. The bad guys (Yes, that’s what Aiden calls them) want Elly, dead or alive. So Elly, Aiden, and an extremely uncomfortable-looking Alfie embark on a globetrotting adventure. That all sounds like fun, right? It is, and here’s the thing about that. Director Matthew Vaughn has a well-deserved reputation for making (ahem) kick-ass action movies. His creative blend of choreography, color usage, editing, and cinematography has created numerous memorable action sequences. He’s shown us Magneto slaughtering South American Nazis, a blue collar Londoner thrown into a Bondian world, and a tween rampaging through a group of luckless mobsters. There’s a reason Vaughn is one of the best in the business. With Argylle, Vaughn has made a sunnier, though sloppier, version of Kingsman. It’s not as edgelord-adjacent as Kick-Ass, and in fact his tone is breezy and light. So light that everything feels somewhat inconsequential, but we’ll get to that. What’s frustrating to me is that as cleverly shot and staged as the action sequences are, the pacing constantly drags things down.  This being a Matthew Vaughn joining, there’s no surprise that the action sequences are clever, such as a dance/shootout with multicolored clouds of smoke and an ice skating sequence without ice. I enjoyed the moments where we see Elly watching Aiden dispatch legions of goons, and her perspective keeps shifting between seeing Aiden and seeing Argylle. Heavy handed and obvious? Yes. Entertaining? Sure, sort of! Unfortunately, the film drags quite a bit, particularly in the first half. There’s no reason on God’s green earth for a spy comedy to be close to two and a half hours long. A film like this should move like a souped up Aston Martin. Too often, Argylle moves like Roger Moore in A View to a Kill. The screenplay by Jason Fuchs telegraphs a twist, then another, then another. It’s not bad writing at all, but Fuchs seems more interested in yanking the rug out from under the audience than he is at telling a strong story. Sixty percent less twists would have been good in this case. There’s also the problem of repetition where, over and over, Elly and Aiden have to do a thing. Elly doesn’t want to do the thing, Aiden attempts to persuade her, then he forces her to do the thing. It’s frustrating, because when Fuchs occasionally digs into the characters or the ridiculousness of the world that Elly has been flung into, it’s fun. Another couple of drafts spent tightening up the story & going for more interesting approaches would have been an improvement.  The last ten thousand words I wrote, though? None of it really matters. Because as I walked out of the screening, I overheard a group of women talking to a publicist about Argylle. They loved it, adored it, and were singing the film’s praises. Argylle is too long, sort of dumb, and less clever than it is “clever.” If you treat it as a fleeting Friday night trifle, and if you definitely ignore me on this one, you’ll be happier. *Perhaps the most unbelievable detail is that Colorado could actually have a statewide rail system that’s clean and inexpensive. Who do you people think we are, Europe?"
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," There’s style over substance, and then there’s Argylle. A film that makes Michael Bay look restrained, Argylle is a rowdy, ridiculously over-the-top joy ride that only exists to look cool. In other words, it’s a film from Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, Kingsman: The Secret Service).  The director’s latest has enough bullets to stock a gun store and enough fireworks to supply a Fourth of July extravaganza, not to mention enough stars to fill an Oscar party. The cast includes Henry Cavill as a secret agent, Dua Lipa as a Bond girl, Bryce Dallas Howard as a novelist, John Cena as a wingman, Sam Rockwell as a hitman, Samuel L. Jackson as a cool man and Bryan Cranston as a mustache twirling villain. And the action takes place in a number of breezy locales, from glamorous disco halls to glitzy mansions to glorious beaches that will have audiences planning their next vacations. There’s so much on screen you aren’t sure where to look, but sometimes a movie can have too much going on, which is where Vaughn’s latest comes up short. We’ve all seen movies that feel like multiple movies in one. Argylle is even worse. It feels like an entire season of television crammed into two hours of screen time. When we first meet Argylle (Cavill), he’s on the dance floor with a woman (Lipa) in a sparkling gold dress, her eyes fixated on his flat-top hair. The two get down to some funky music, but she has undercover agents with her, leading to a shootout that builds to a car chase through a coastal village. In a stunning conclusion, Argylle’s wingman (Cena) snatches the suspect off her motorcycle as if catching a frisbee. It’s an incredibly thrilling moment, but then Vaughn drains all momentum from his screenplay. He cuts to Elly Conway (Howard), author of the popular “Argylle” series, as she types the story we were just watching on screen. She isn’t sure how she wants to end her latest novel, so she decides to take some time off and hops on a train, where she meets a real life spy. On board, Aiden (Rockwell) tells her of a shady organization not unlike the one she writes about, which is the first of many meta ideas on display. Reality and fiction begin to collide for Elly, often within the same scene, as she gets swept up in a conspiracy that’s based on her adrenaline-fueled novels. Vaughn keeps the action coming at a frenetic pace, too, tossing various obstacles at his muscular stars. The main appeal of Argylle is seeing these stars take on numerous villains, and like clockwork, we get to see Cavill and Rockwell take on hundreds of extras all at once. All the while, catchy music blares from the speakers, bullets fly in slow-motion, bodies pile up like firewood and one liners fly like ammo. Anyone who has seen Vaughn’s Kingsman franchise knows what to expect, but something is missing from his latest spy caper–something along the lines of coherence. The vivid color palette and the light vibe is a nice change of pace from the dreary blockbusters of late. We’re not sure why action movies have been covered in a haze of self seriousness, as if the genre wasn’t made to give audience’s a fun escape from their daily lives. But the meta tone and layered script wears thin fast, and eventually, you can’t keep up with all the plot twists being thrown your way. As the story unfolds–both the novel being written by Elly and the character’s real life romp–it becomes increasingly hard to follow Argylle, a spy pastiche that lacks any sort of substance."
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," When does a filmmaker run out of something to say? That’s a question worth asking while watching “Argylle,” a new spy movie by Matthew Vaughn that feels like another blender of a thousand other movies. What is most curious about this overcooked extravaganza is how it begins with a very enticing premise. The authors of famous bestsellers rarely have an actual, real-life connection to the thriller fantasies they concoct. What if one of them was suddenly yanked into one of their scenarios? Vaughn’s movie begins with that charming premise and a convincing Bryce Dallas Howard, before turning into another shootout fest that becomes a parody of itself.  The Agent Argylle of the title is played by Henry Cavill and opens the movie with a hilariously self-mocking mini-adventure in Greece, also involving another buffed agent (John Cena), a tech guru named Keira (Ariana DeBose) and a steamy dance number with a mysterious woman, LaGrange (Dua Lipa). These turn out to be characters in a series of spy novels by Elly Conway (Howard), who lives a pretty comfortable life at home with her cat. Fans are clamoring for the next book, which she’s busy writing. While on a train ride to visit her mother, (Catherine O’Hara), Elly bumps into a scruffy weirdo, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who claims to be a fan. To Elly’s shock, he soon takes down a squad of goons before revealing that the writer is being sought by a nefarious organization, the Division, led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston), who wants to extract classified information Elly apparently has in her mind. It’s not just a case of a good author’s overactive imagination. After starting off with measured, satirical fare like “Kick-Ass,” Vaughn became a big-budget name with the “X-Men” and “Kingsman” franchises. “Argylle” is a big, red blinking warning sign that he needs to return to his roots. Surely there must be some passion project gathering dust in his desk. Some of the old fire is almost there in the first act, which plays around with the idea of comparing the exaggerated world and look of Elly’s books with the supposedly rougher, real-life action involving Aidan, who has a normal haircut compared to Cavill’s overdone stylings. One of the best jokes in the entire movie has Aidan trying to convince Elly there’s nothing to the old move of crushing a bad guy’s head with a good foot twist. The material also pokes fun at those daring rooftop jumps all action movies feature. Cavill and John Cena are perfectly paired as spoofs of muscular action clichés. Dua Lipa is barely used but would have been great as well in satirizing further the supermodel assassins recycled to death. Then “Argylle” makes the fatal mistake of giving itself a twist that turns it precisely into just another generic action flick where all the satirical humor is lost, boring, CGI-heavy sequences take over and you feel the movie’s 2 hours and 19 minutes. The screenplay by Jason Fuchs becomes so convoluted you easily lose track of what the spies are even after. A skating gag over spilled oil falls flat because it arrives during an endlessly dragging chase with few good jokes. Samuel L. Jackson drops in as the good counter to Bryan Cranston’s sleepy villain. Both great actors are left with little to do. The only other funny wink that lasts is how a coveted notebook belongs to an anarchist named Bakunin, after Marx’s anarchic rival in the International. Vaughn’s needle drops are also pretty weak. The use of the “new” Beatles song released last year, “Now and Then,” is so calculated it’s almost insulting. It turns into the movie’s love theme but for a romance that never works because Howard and Dallas lack the necessary chemistry and build up. It’s even more unconvincing when the movie tries hard with a sequence involving guns and heart-shaped smoke. Matthew Vaughn is usually a director of colorful style, yet lately he’s been making movies where the plot gets lost after a good opening. His 2021 “The King’s Man” had the same issue with good actors and a superb villain who gets killed 20 minutes in. Then the whole operation goes off the rails. It’s as if he only liked the concept and following studio dogma sapped all enthusiasm. “Argylle” has the same problem. It opens strongly with an idea we want to see play out all the way to the end. Why did it need to become the very thing it starts off mocking? This movie feels sluggish and timid, because it tries too hard to be a “blockbuster.” As the last few months have shown, audiences are growing tired of the same old formulas. A filmmaker with this much talent shouldn’t shy away from turning the rules upside down."
"Feb 5, 2024",positive," With more plot twists than a tartan has squares, ARGYLLE combines ROMANCING THE STONE with – well, let’s not completely give the game away. We’ll say it starts out as one of those movies where a woman author unexpectedly finds herself living out one of her novels. In ARGYLLE, writer Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) pens espionage tales rather than romance. This immediately raises our hopes, as while it’s always possible to bring something new to a subgenre, a lot of the romcom versions of this retread the notion of making fun of romance tropes while simultaneously wanting us to buy into them. Here, readers are impressed with Elly’s details about spycraft, even if her main character Argylle (Henry Cavill) tends to dress more like 007 than a real undercover agent would. Elly likes doing book signings and Q&As, and normally, she has a good flow. But writer’s block has struck. Mom (Catherine O’Hara) suggests that Elly visit her parents for the weekend; Mom will help Elly brainstorm. So, Elly – who is phobic about airplanes – packs up her laptop and her beloved cat Alfie and takes the train to see the folks. Instead of reaching her intended destination, she finds herself in the middle of some real knives flashing, guns blazing spy vs. spy action. The script by Jason Fuchs spins us around so successfully that, like Elly, we’re not sure who to trust either. There are so many reveals and reversals that we wind up anticipating more, even once they’ve effectively stopped. Director Matthew Vaughn loves his speeding, sparking, circling, smoke-exploding chases and fights, with literal dance moves incorporated into some of them. This is Bond and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE slightly on helium. There’s a lot to enjoy here, including some great scenery, plenty of fun surprises, and a cast where everybody knows what they’re doing. Howard displays great versatility and appeal as the protagonist. Sam Rockwell, as a shaggy stranger who approaches Elly on the train, has a role that lets him exhibit charisma and soul, which he does with apparent effortlessness. One minor gripe is that ARGYLLE is occasionally too convinced of its own charm and wit. There’s an air of self-congratulation that pops up here and there, keeping us at a bit of a remove. Still, overall, ARGYLLE is clever and fun – probably even worth watching again just to see what clues can be picked up along the way to hint at all the crucial switchbacks. Once it’s over, it’s also worth comparing to a certain other spy series and imagining how much livelier that could be with just a touch of ARGYLLE’s spirit."
"Feb 5, 2024",neutral,"Argylle is a lot. Matthew Vaughn thrives when focusing on these insane yet beautifully shot action sequences, but this specific story is all over the place. The biggest twists are obvious, and certain characters are wasted."
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," Across its extensive, gimmicky marketing campaign, Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle repeatedly asks one eponymous question: Who is agent Argylle? It’s an enticing, almost Hitchcockian ask that beckons viewers into uncovering a secret so shocking, it threatens to redefine everything they thought they knew about the film. But upon its conclusion, audiences are left with another important question: Why should we care? It’s a query that ends up being much more practical, especially because Vaughn’s insipid spy-action satire manifests as little more than an amalgamation of all the half-baked tropes it seeks to make light of. In attempting to deconstruct it’s “Bondian” influences with a winking, high-concept plot, it retains none of the charm and wit that made them so memorable and, most of all, enjoyable—often becoming the butt of the joke it aims to deliver. At the center of Argylle lies novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who on the heels of her successful 5th entry in the “Argylle” spy novel series hits a creative block drafting the next instalment. While on route to visit her mother (Catherine O’Hara) she runs into the scruffy, bumbling Aiden (Sam Rockwell, in the film’s sole good performance), a real-life operative who informs her that the plot of her latest novel has inadvertently aligned with and exposed the shady activities of a rogue spy organization led by the merciless Ritter (Bryan Cranston). With a gaggle of evil henchman hunting her, she must rely on Aiden to not only survive but uncover the conspiracy she finds herself embroiled in. Argylle hopes to insert a metatextual wrinkle into its globe-trotting adventure by having Elly’s literary creation, secret agent Argylle (Henry Cavill), flicker on screen as a double for Aiden. But the effect, intended to parody spy movies, falls flat at each turn. Particularly because its fictional sequences— full of the intentionally corny platitudes 007 might spout—unfold exactly like their “real life” counterparts. Neither Elly or Aiden resemble genuine people, sharing more in common with the plasticky caricatures Vaughn and Company make fun of than anything else. Cranston’s Ritter is the walking embodiment of every cliched super villain committed to paper, from his menacing grin to his violent treatment of subordinates. As a result, Argylle becomes the very shoddy, thinly written caper it clambers to poke holes in. Repeatedly bobbing for the lowest hanging fruit with groan-inducing dialogue like “It seems we serve the same master” or, even worse, “let the lamb roar”. What makes matters worse is that Argylle thinks we’re laughing with it during these moments, when we’re really laughing at it. Any chance of Argylle’s smug, meta-narrative hitting its target is dashed by the over-polished filmmaking, which zaps the experience of any identity and personality—something its apparent influences could never be accused of lacking. The flatly lit cinematography gives way to a flurry of choppy action sequences that are defined by their over-reliance on cheesy slow-motion and reaction shots that more-or-less consist of Elly’s computer-generated feline giving a disgruntled stare. Vaughn’s insistence on underpinning these scenes with a steady stream of eye-rolling needle drops—the most soulless of which being The Beatles’ recently recovered “Now and Then”—puts an emphatic stamp on how trite and banal Argylle feels. With each easily predictable and confoundingly convenient twist, the film’s central mystery continues to lack a noticeable bite. An unfortunate effect the ceaselessly grating, monochromatic flashbacks only serve to heighten. The more Argylle explains its convoluted plot, the less interested we become, especially as each revelation forces these already skin-deep characters to shift gears and radically alter how they react to one another. The result is both jarring and lifeless, culminating in a climactic hallway action sequence that aims for the operatic and the idiosyncratic but rings hollow with each feigned maneuver. At its best, Argylle is the cinematic equivalent of a very, very dull escape room. What could have been a sly satire of the much-adored spy genre is undone by the very foibles and failings that plague them. Vaughn’s haphazard attempt to connect it to the Kingsman franchise and tease a supposed sequel serves as a final, forgettable nail in film’s coffin. If nothing else, Argylle will make viewers appreciate the spirit of those cheesy, over-the-top spy movies that much more—just not in the way it intended.

"Feb 5, 2024",positive," Matthew Vaughn’s films don’t always hit the target, and they’re often accused of being tonally misjudged, but there’s no denying that he knows how to craft an exciting, adrenalised action film full of wit, invention, and often ludicrous spectacle. He’s done it again with Argylle, a witty and clever spy thriller from a script by Jason Fuchs that constantly surprises with the ingenious twists and turns of a plot that borders on the ridiculous yet never quite topples into extreme parody. Argylle confounds its audience’s expectations from the off in a high-energy action scene clearly intended as a parody of old-school Bond as superspy Argylle (Henry Cavill) pursues the sultry LaGrange (Dua Lipa) around vertiginous coastal roads in Greece, and it’s as corny as hell. Then we discover that what we’re watching is a sequence from the latest spy thriller novel written by Bryce Dallas Howard’s slightly mousy cat-loving author, Elly Conway, being read to a breathless audience at a book launch reading. Elly has had huge success with a series of books based on her imaginary spy, Argylle, and when she finds herself facing writer’s block trying to find a suitable ending for her fifth book, she takes a train trip to visit her parents in Chicago in search of inspiration. But on the train, she meets up – coincidentally? – with Aidan (Sam Rockwell), an actual spy who quickly and creatively saves her from being attacked by a group of assassins from a criminal organisation known as the Division. It turns out that her novels have uncannily predicted the future of their operations, and they’re keen to find out what she knows and what’s going to happen next. The subsequent two-plus hours are a dizzying, helter-skelter thrill ride of increasingly absurd (and frankly impossible) action scenes and wild globe-trotting wound tightly around a plot that gives a new meaning to ‘far-fetched’ and yet is irresistibly enjoyable because it all works and comes together inside the world the film has created for it. Howard and Rockwell are having a great time, and it’s clear that the rest of the cast are indulging themselves, too. There are great turns from Bryan Cranston, Samuel L Jackson, Catherine O’Hara and Chip the cat and while audiences may have been led to believe that Henry Cavill’s the star of the show here, his brief twinkling cameos are terrific fun. Undoubtedly, some might find Argylle’s knowingness insufferable and a bit smug and become exasperated by the overuse of CGI/green screen, another example of the film playing with its own sense of unreality. But if you’re in the mood for some fast-paced, non-stop, irreverent action that turns its own genre inside out, then Argylle’s the one for you. Vaughn’s plans to launch a new franchise off the back of the film might not fly if early box office is any measure, but c’est la vie. Perhaps the campaign to get Vaughn on board to direct the next Bond film (if there ever is one) should start here – based on Argylle, he clearly knows just what it would take to shake 007 out of his doldrums and launch him back into the centre of action cinema again. But for now, if nothing else, Argylle is guaranteed to blow away those February blues."
"Feb 5, 2024",neutral," Argylle opens with a (much promoted) premise that many filmgoers will find intriguing, if not familiar: Something supposedly fictional an author is writing may, in fact, be true! In this case, could the spy hijinks involving the film’s titular character (Henry Cavill) and written about by author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) somehow actually be describing real organizations, people and threats? If yes, how exactly is that possible? If no, what’s wrong with Conway? (To be fair, trailers for Argylle and the film itself quickly discard that second question.) What Matthew Vaughn’s latest film does try to keep closer to the vest is whether Conway’s connection with the events she writes has a perfectly logical explanation (as with Sandra Bullock’s Loretta Sage in The Lost City) or lies more in a realm of the supernatural (think the control Emma Thompson’s Karen Eiffel has over her characters in Stranger than Fiction). By the time Sam Rockwell’s scruffy, self-confessed spy, Aidan, enters and the nameless henchmen start dying, it’s a question of how clever Argylle will be and how much fun will we have watching another spy-infused, stylish caper from the same director who gave us Kingsman: The Secret Service (itself a fun romp through a Bond-adjacent playground)? Unfortunately, the answers are “not very” and “not much,” though it’s certainly not for lack of trying.  On the surface, Vaughn’s latest effort possesses an aggressively packaged charm. The ensemble cast seems calculated to trip at least one “fave” from the widest possible population of potential viewers. Cavill. John Cena. Bryan Cranston. Catherine O’Hara. Samuel L. Jackson. Ariana DeBose. Dua Lipa. A cat. It’s a who’s who of “Oh, I like him/her/movies with cats!” Any one of which might convince someone to buy a ticket.  But much as a beautifully wrapped box can disappoint with what’s inside, any initial excitement engendered by Argylle’s cast and premise wears away as the supposed ensemble proves more a semblance, the “twists” become tedious and the film suffers from a gradual decay of the many “realities” needed to undergird any story that wants to tread the fantastic. Despite an opening sequence featuring Cavill, Cena, DeBose and Lipa (and Richard E. Grant in an appearance shorter than this parenthetical took to type), most of Argylle’s runtime rests on the shoulders of Howard and Rockwell. They’re game, but Rockwell’s hench-homiciding—so many nameless henchman—and Howard’s extended “Eek, I’m helpless” riff get tiring. (As does Alfie the cat, whose presence I suppose is deemed necessary to sell Conway as the “socially inept cat lady” and give the unnecessary CGI crew a paycheck.) Then there are the twists. A good twist doesn’t just surprise, it surprises in a way that, in hindsight, makes perfect sense—the clues were there all along! The twists in Argylle feel less like surprises and more like inevitable roads the script has to go down because there are two hours and 20 minutes to kill in this baby. As a result, the film has barely more suspense than an old Scooby-Doo episode. When a twist of note does happen—Elly’s antecedents are less Bullock’s Sage and Thompson’s Eiffel but more Geena Davis’ Samantha Caine—well, by then the wheels of absurdity are so routinely flying off the narrative that it’s hard to enjoy what’s left of the ride. It’s too often ignored in genre films involving the fantastical, but suspension of disbelief is a gift given by an audience to a storyteller on the condition that the story told will feel real despite all the stuff that’s manifestly not true. Superman can fly, but gravity still works on the normies. There’s a magic spigot that spews forth an endless supply of henchmen, but bullets still abide by the laws of physics. If you ignore too many of the “realities” in a movie, it can come across as actively dismissive of your audience. That’s not to say Vaughn and scriptwriter Jason Fuchs are trying to insult us, but Aidan and Elly’s henchmen-holing Holi festival for two and the crude oil-capades that follow come across as sequences that even a group of 10-year-olds hopped up on Mountain Dew would wince at. For a cool $200 million and this cast, I would have gladly taken less marketing mystery on the front end and more rigor in the actual story."
"Feb 5, 2024",neutral," Argylle is so meta that it hurts. The film throws thriller writer Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) into a real-life espionage conspiracy that is somehow based on her fictional characters. Her two worlds collide in a story that piles reversals on top of reversals. Jason Fuchs’ screenplay may be complex, but it is not especially original. Movies love confounding authors by bringing their characters to life, usually to teach lessons about appreciating the “real world”; an actual Argylle novel has been published, although the book has only tangential connections to the movie. One interesting twist here is that Elly relates so much to Argylle that she turns to him for advice, even in the midst of shoot-outs and car chases. And the agent will often interrupt his scenes to complain to her about his dialogue. Elly and Aidan go from Colorado in the United States to London, the south of France and a palace on the Arabian peninsula. At each stop, they gather clues and shoot their way out of traps, then move on to the next cliffhanger. Detailing more of the plot means giving away its twists, which is really all Argylle has going for it. Despite careful engineering, the double crosses and betrayals are too often predictable – maybe because they are based on genre clichés. The cast includes old and new faces. Bryan Cranston plays the head of an elite espionage agency, Catherine O’Hara is an overprotective mum, and World Wrestling Entertainment champion John Cena is an improbable computer expert. Some old friends from earlier Vaughn films pop up, like Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a self-professed “very cool cat”, and Sofia Boutella as a “keeper of secrets”. Both singers make outstanding contributions to the soundtrack. In fact, the best elements of Argylle may be its jukebox of pounding dance anthems, notably “Electric Energy”. It has been over 20 years since Vaughn helped usher in an entire generation of action stars in films like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (which he produced) and Layer Cake. By comparison Argylle feels glossy and overblown, and watching it a way to pass time."
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," Argylle--For about the first half or so of this action comedy, our heroine Elly is pulled through chases and shootouts, squealing in girlish fright. Played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Elly is an author of popular spy thrillers featuring the flawlessly suave secret agent man Argylle, represented in her mind's eye by Henry Cavill. One day on an Amtrak train she's accosted by Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a scruffy obnoxious guy who tells her that she's in grave danger, as her books are proving prophetic in real-world counterintelligence. Within seconds Aidan is defending her, and her put-upon Scottish Fold cat Alfie, from countless assassins in extended, cartoony hand-to-hand and gun combat, all the while dispensing reassurance and encouragement, and she's swept off into a globetrotting adventure. You may recall that this was the central gag in the lame 2010 comedy Night and Day, with Cameron Diaz as the civilian and Tom Cruise as the hypercompetent and comically supportive secret agent man. Rockwell's woebegone manner is funnier and more agreeable than that of Cruise, but even so too much of this film feels derivative of previous spy parodies, both recent and vintage, from 2022's Bullet Train to the Mission: Impossible and Bourne flicks, and beyond. As in many of those films, the preposterously over-choreographed action scenes carry no real emotional weight, and I found the first part of the movie pretty tedious. It started to grow on me after a while, though. The stars help; I've long been inclined to approve of Howard, with her lush pin-up beauty and her sweetness, and as Elly delves deeper into the case and gains more confidence, Howard is able to overcome the condescending hysterical woman stereotype she's forced to play along with early on. And she and the self-assured sad sack Rockwell play off each other nicely and without phony bickering. The supporting cast is also top-notch; director Matthew Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs would have to work hard to prevent Bryan Cranston, as the fed-up evil kingpin, or Samuel L. Jackson as another spy boss, or the great Catherine O'Hara, pestering Elly to spend a weekend with Mom, from giving the audience any amusement. Along with Cavill's Argylle, the movie offers such overtly glamorous types as Jon Cena and Dua Lipa and Sofia Boutella and Ariana DeBose and Richard E. Grant, and they add another layer of drollery. But just about the time I was loosening up and starting to think that Argylle was pretty good after all, it overplays its hand in the way of so many contemporary action blockbusters, shoveling one exhaustingly explosive finale after another at us. At two hours and twenty minutes it's at least thirty minutes too long. After a while you might start wondering if the movie has ended, and you're already a half-hour into Argylle 2."
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," Matthew Vaughn made his name by supercharging the comic book genre with a bit of the old ultraviolence in his adaptation of Mark Millar’s graphic novel Kick-Ass. It wasn’t his first film, but it arguably launched him into the mainstream. This was in 2010, right at the beginning of the superhero boom, and a rude, lewd R-rated (15 in the UK) action-comedy that aped the blossoming, earnest genre felt quite novel at the time. He tried this schtick again in 2014 with Kingsman, his take on the British spy movie, in which Taron Egerton plays a lovable oik recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Vaughn appears to have found his groove with the spy stuff. After three Kingsman films, he’s in similar territory with Argylle, centred around shy author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) who lives a reclusive life in Colorado with her cat Alfie (played by Vaughn’s wife Claudia Schiffer’s cat, Chip) and spends all her time dreaming up adventures for the titular superspy (Henry Cavill with an incredibly unflattering haircut) and his partner Wyatt (a poe-faced John Cena). Things take a turn when Elly is accosted on a train by Aidan (Sam Rockwell) who claims to be a huge fan of her work…and in the business of espionage himself. Aidan informs Elly she’s in grave danger, setting in motion a spy caper across the world as the pair attempt to understand why the events of Elly’s spy series appear to happening in real life. A pastiche of spy fodder such as James Bond, The Avengers and The Man from U.N.C.L.E, there isn’t much here in the way of original thought (The Lost City did the whole ‘neurotic female author gets sucked into the world of her books’ with more charm back in 2022) and the cliche-riddled dialogue feels so dated it’s as if Jason Fuchs’ script was found down the back of a sofa after ten years among the crumbs and lost pocket change. Speaking of dated – “the final Beatles” song, Now and Then, features heavily in Argylle (perhaps in a synergy move between Apple Films and Apple Music, who’s to say). Now and Then very famously was only released in November 2023, which makes it baffling that Argylle attempts to pass off the song as an established classic. “This used to be our song,” Aidan comments to Elly, reminiscing about their past. Argylle is a contemporary film (Samuel L Jackson spends almost all of his screen time watching a Lakers game on a giant television) which makes this a particularly glaring anachronism that is at best lazy scripting and at worst painful product placement. Maybe it’s both! At any rate, it feels indicative of how slapdash and forced the whole thing is. Rockwell and Howard, bless their hearts, really try their best with the awful script. Both are charismatic screen presences, even if their characters don’t exactly stretch them ability-wise. At least Howard gets a lot more to do in this film than she ever does in the Jurassic World franchise she’s been shackled to for a decade. Less charming is the charisma vacuum Dua Lipa, who appears heavily in the film’s publicity materials but mercifully only turns up on screen for two short scenes. She’s a great pop star, but no Cher when it comes to line delivery. There are a few decent action setpieces – notably one where Elly skates around on a load of oil, and another bafflingly set to X-Factor winner Leona Lewis’s cover of Snow Patrol’s Run – but they lack the grim cartoonish edge of Kick-Ass or Kingsman, and by the time you’ve seen your second ‘Ooh they’re not really dead’ fakeout of the film, the stakes start to shrink dramatically. Throw into the mix a bloated runtime, at once overcomplicated and generic plot, and a shockingly cheap-looking aesthetic for a film that supposedly cost $200 million, and there’s not a whole lot to really enjoy here. To Vaughn’s credit, at least Argylle isn’t as gleefully misogynistic as the Kingsman films, but that’s a bit like saying “Well, at least the pigeon shit didn’t get in my mouth” after a pigeon has shat on your face. Most ominous of all: a mid-credit sequence ties the film into the Kingsman franchise, setting up some sort of horrifying Matthew Vaughn Extended Universe (what timing, just as everyone’s losing patience with Marvel and DC). ‘Argylle: Book One — The Movie — Coming Soon’ a title card reads, which feels like more of a threat than a promise.

"Feb 5, 2024",negative," A bestselling spy novelist named Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard, looking painfully ill at ease in the role) finds herself caught in the middle of a real-life espionage adventure when she is targeted, along with her permanently disgruntled pet Scottish fold cat, by a shadowy syndicate with nefarious intentions. Dishevelled stranger Aidan (Sam Rockwell) seems to be protecting her. But is he who he says he is? Is she? Is anyone? Do we care? And what was Dua Lipa thinking when she agreed to the dancefloor scene? The latest picture from director Matthew Vaughn is a colossal, cumbersome dud. Structured as a cross between a Matryoshka doll full of shock reveals and a partially unravelled piece of knitting, it resembles the rejected, incoherent offcuts from the Kingsman series. For all its generic spy movie glitz – we zip between locations in the US, London, rural France and an aircraft carrier – it has an impoverished, synthetic feel. In particular, the special effects seem shoddy and unfinished and the screenplay struggles to keep up with its own twists and turns. The film is apparently the first in a threatened Argylle trilogy, but I won’t hold my breath for parts two and three."
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," Stylish, smartly edited, and bursting with energy, the trailer
for Argylle is fantastic. That’s about the only thing related to this
movie the superlative could be used to describe. The actual production is a
polar opposite: overlong, tedious, and bursting with idiot plot contrivances.
There are obvious story holes so big that a 747 flown by a chimpanzee could
make it through. All the pleasure hinted at by the trailer is illusory.  The movie’s two-tier structure is less convoluted than it initially
seems (or than the trailer makes it appear to be). Essentially, there’s a “real
world” setup, focusing on best-selling author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas
Howard), her cat, and her fussy mother, Ruth (Catherine O’Hara). Then there are
enactments of sections of Elly’s books (or phantasms of her imagination) featuring
her hero, the suave super-agent Argylle (Henry Cavill) with an outrageous flat-top
haircut, and his dour sidekick, Wyatt (John Cena).  Elly’s life takes a turn for the stranger when, while riding
a train, she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a fan who claims to be a spy. Moments
later, she’s dodging knives and bullets in a fight for her life – all while
carrying her feline, Alfie, in her backpack. Soon, she and Aidan are jetting across
the Atlantic to keep one step ahead of the shady agents from a shadowy
organization run by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston), who think she has insider
knowledge because her books seem to predict the future.  Argylle gets worse the longer it’s on screen. It
opens with a degree of promise (vaguely reminiscent of the underrated 2006
rom-com, Stranger than Fiction, in which a character and his author
interact) but quickly abandons the quirkier aspects of the narrative to proceed
in a more straightforward fashion. There are some early warning signs: the
action is pedestrian, there’s a lack of energy, and the tone is inconsistent.
By the 90-minute mark, Argylle’s tongue has become dislodged from its
cheek as it devolves into a Jason Bourne/Mission: Impossible rip-off (those
are more applicable comps than Bond) with a lot of pointless action and
lackluster stunts. But none of this adequately prepares the viewer for the
mind-numbing final act wherein those previously mentioned gaping plot holes
appear (one related to a convoluted identity issue and one involving the
inexplicable decision not to kill two characters) as the plot goes into a corkscrew
nosedive from which it never recovers. Not even a multi-hued smoke massacre set
to a pop tune can save this movie from a complete implosion.  There’s less Henry Cavill than one might expect (or hope
for). He makes occasional appearances in recreations of scenes from Elly’s
books and occasionally “appears” to her during fight scenes, when he and
Rockwell are spliced together. As the lead, Bryce Dallas Howard is fine in the
first half and miscast during the second. Despite getting a lot of screen time
in the trailer, Dua Lipa has virtually none in the movie (pretty much all of
her material is used in the trailer), qualifying her appearance as a cameo.
Ditto for Richard E. Grant and Ariana DeBose. John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson get
more on-screen time but have little to do beyond collecting paychecks. As for
Bryan Cranston as the villain – his frothing at the mouth seems oddly
half-hearted. He’s not necessarily more grounded than a generic Bond megalomaniac
but isn’t any more interesting. And I’m still not entirely sure what his
motives are.  Director Matthew Vaughn has an uneven resume but, until he
became mired in the Kingsman universe (the first film was good; the
other two, not so much), he was a solid bet for a good time. His early films – Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service – were enjoyable romps. Argylle represents his first out-and-out failure. Indications are that Vaughn
isn’t done with the Kingsman movies – a post-credits scene offers a
tangible connection between Argylle
and that series.  Vaughn is apparently going for something that’s one part
cartoonish action and one part tongue-in-cheek parody. It misfires on all cylinders.
Even if one takes nothing seriously (which is really the only way to
approach Argylle), the action fails to excite and the comedy is flaccid.
I didn’t laugh once and the movie’s stylized and satirical tone defused any
connection I might have felt for the characters. Perhaps if the proceedings
hadn’t dragged on well past the two-hour mark, it wouldn’t have seemed like
such a chore to sit through. The film’s failure stands as a stark reminder
that, no matter how seductive a trailer might be, February releases should
always be approached with caution. This is the month when Hollywood jettisons
its refuse and this particular sampling belongs buried deep in a landfill."
"Feb 5, 2024",negative," The end credits for Matthew Vaughn’s $200+ million flop Argylle contain a scene linking this misguided venture into another DOA franchise, the dormant-for-a-reason Kingsman series; Vaughn clearly anticipates an endless porridge pot of funding for films he clearly loves to make but audiences hate to watch. Paying customers are right to feel aggrieved; billed as an all-star ‘ensemble’ thriller, this Apple TV+ production features three line cameos from John Cena and Ariana DeBose, about ten minutes of a hammy Henry Cavill failing his Bond audition badly, and pop singer Dua Lipa wisely exits before the six minute mark. You’d do well to do the same as her, although not going to see this at all is a far better move; reverse word of mouth will stop Argylle making half its budget back, although Apple won’t care since we’re picking up the tab buying their overpriced cables. After a resistible CGI cartoon opening set in Greece to a Barry White soundtrack, we’re off to a sub-Romancing the Stone/Lost City adventure with JK Rowling-level authoress Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), a successful spy novelist with, gasp, no man in her life. What’s wrong with her?  ‘There’s a reason I write about spies not romance,’ she explains, but where does Elly get her ideas from? Superspy Aidan (Sam Rockwell) engineers a meeting cute on an Amtrak train after a book-signing, but their first encounter turns into the usual hyper-kinetic brawl while a remix of Sylvester’s ‘Do you wanna funk?’ plays pointlessly over the fakey action. Then we’re off to London, then Arabia, then an oil-tanker somewhere, but we’re never more than a few feet from cheapo green-screen with phoned-in performances to match. ‘Why does this keep happening?’ asks Elly, and she’s got a point; Vaughn’s been plugging this line for ten years despite collapsing public interest. ‘This is B.S.’ is another line from Elly that answers her own question precisely; Jason Fuchs’ script throws out such exhausted sub-sitcom zingers as ‘French people give me the crepes.’ Name-checks include Steve Jobs (twice) Jeffrey Dahmer (once), product placement for the Savoy Hotel, three unwanted plays for The Beatles’ Now And Then, and a phoned-in monologue from Samuel L Jackson about the quality of Pinot Noir. It’s hard to imagine why Snow Patrol would licence a cover of their song Light Up for a scene of Elly stabbing multiple soldiers through their rib-cages, but I guess money talks, it just doesn’t say anything coherent in Vaughn’s hands. Argylle is a hot mess; there’s some ramblings about ‘MK ultra on steroids’ to justify a series of ungainly plot-twists, but it’s also just smug, aggressive garbage featuring offensive racist and sexist stereotypes. Girls can’t land a punch while boys kill dozens with ease, and a late plot twist doesn’t diffuse notions firmly in line with Vaughn’s similarly misogynist Kingsman films, and the trip to Arabia is less than culturally enlightening or sensitive. So why are Apple putting their sainted branding on this? We understand the importance of inimitable behaviour in movies, so what’s funny about characters dropping cats, or even throwing them off buildings to see how they land? Even the poster image of a cat in a back-pack is irresponsible, you simply can’t just pick up an unsuspecting animal and use it as a fashion accessory without causing it considerable distress. Despite mugging support from Catherine O’Hara and Bryan Cranston, Argylle sucks and blows simultaneously for 139 minutes. The February dumping ground for broken unwanted product is an old cinematic tradition, what’s surprising is seeing Apple cheerfully adding their brand to the bonfire of outmoded and unwanted product, and suckering Universal into releasing it. Sure, maybe the cast emerge with nice Apple gear and a fat pay-check, but audiences may well never want to see their smug, irritating faces in any context after this enduring this lump of freshly dumped Barry White. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it that bad. Argylle just needed more focus and a better direction for its few creative action sequences. The constant plot twists are really what started to go overboard for me. Along with ripping off a certain 90’s action movie that happened to co-star Samuel L. Jackson as well. Traffic bad? Got cold waiting on the roof for you, even in my argyle sweater. Have to change it to a jump from the roof of Fraggle’s shed. The number one movie last week! Sounds like you might have missed something. Perhaps time for a re-watch. If Cavill is only in it for 10 minutes, why does he have pole position on the poster? I’d also like to know what’s not funny about throwing cats off buildings. I think you know the answers to both of these questions deep down in your heart of hearts, but instead I’ll say…
1- why is the films actual female protagonist sandwiched in a row of actors do you can barely notice her? Well, he never listens to me when I tell him to stop watching bad movies, just like Holmes never listened to Watson about his coke habit, so I’d say the similarities are pretty similar on that front!
As for you and Mrs Hudson, I’m pretty sure she was a widow. So sorry Fraggle, Phil’s just gotta go! This demo site is only for demonstration purposes. All images are copyrighted to their respective owners. All content cited is derived from their respective sources."
"Feb 4, 2024",positive," It was evident from the moment the trailers released that Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle would be a film that doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s outlandish, all over the place, and bonkers in the best way, stacked with a fantastic cast who undoubtedly had a blast while filming. The joy in Argylle is infectious once a viewer releases any preconceived notions of what it should be and chooses to fully embrace all the first-rate tropes it throws into a delicious mixing pot. A large part of the problem with the film’s unfavorable critical reception is that people are taking it way too seriously. This movie isn’t meant to be the next Bond franchise, nor does it ever market itself to be. It’s also a little comedic that Vaughn’s unique style of filmmaking isn’t a bold giveaway for the kind of narrative that’ll unfold when The Kingsman movies exist. A movie doesn’t always have to be a profound character study with a complex theme to be great—sometimes, movies can and should just be fun. And this one surely is. The most hilarious thing about Argylle is that the twist was revealed years ago in a press release, but even with the knowledge of who the real agent is, it’s loads of fun to watch it all unfold. The premise is already eccentric, but it’s worth noting that Jason Fuchs’ screenplay is sharp enough to never border on cringeworthy territory. There’s plenty of meat in the character dynamics to sell something that will be indelible, especially for the romance genre girlies. With that said, yes, Argylle is a romance through and through, which is entirely where its appeal comes from with this critic. Films are so often afraid of pushing romance because prestigious genres consistently disregard anything with an unapologetic happy ending. The idea of Bond getting the girl in the end so often translates to “but later Bond also loses the girl.” We seldom get happy endings in spy dramas, which quite frankly then just makes them overly formulaic, yet who’s out there calling it that when it’s dark and gritty enough to meet the standards the expectations set? Very few, ultimately. Argylle thus does something different by placing love at the centerfold, sprinkling it with the right amount of nuance to make every beat feel earned even while you can’t believe what’s unraveling in front of you because it’s so wildly chaotic. No storyteller is getting right when it comes to espionage in film and television—that’s part of the appeal because most filmmakers aren’t actual spies. And so much of what we know is embellished, no matter how accurate it tries to be, so it’s a little ironic not to admit that the dramatization is part of the appeal. Anyone who watched and adored NBC’s Chuck will tell you that the eccentric twist is part of its charm. And in some ways, the romance in Argylle is ultimately how I imagine Chuck could continue if it ever does. As a leading lady, Bryce Dallas Howard’s Elly Conway is a fantastic character to follow along with. The journey she goes on is pretty darn rewarding, no matter how predictable, and the shifts between Elly and Rachel give Howard meaty material to work with—skating through a gas leak with knives under her boots? Iconic. Who wouldn’t want to do that? The film ensures that the character’s arc toward unlocking her memories feels earned, which is part of the reason why it’s so gripping when you let it play along as it wants to. Pair Bryce Dallas Howard with a chameleon actor like Sam Rockwell, and you’ve got yourself the kind of duo worth investing in for multiple films. As an avid romance reader, I initially assumed the two would fall in love along the way, but to learn that they were in love is a detail I didn’t know I needed until it was revealed. (Tying it all back to Henry Cavill’s agent Argylle, and John Cena’s Wyatt is just icing on the top of the cake.) We might not get their initial meet cute, but the chemistry is enough to make their relationship worth investing in. Rockwell is so genuinely vulnerable when he confesses it all that the butterflies are bound to start a frenzy for anyone who’s into adorable affirmations. Cavill fully leans into every stereotype of a suave spy despite the absurd hairstyle working against him. Dua Lipa should’ve had more screen time. Catherine O’Hara is as brilliant as ever. Bryan Cranston is delightfully sinister. Ariana DeBose effectively steals every scene she’s in. Samuel L. Jackson works his magic through and through, and despite CGI shenanigans, Alfie the Cat wins all the brownie points."
"Feb 4, 2024",negative," Argylle finds successful spy novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the midst of a writer’s block, even though she has written four novels about James Bond-esque super spy Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill). He’s suave, cool, and never breaks a sweat, even as he finds out he can no longer trust anyone. It’s the cliffhanger that causes Elly to find herself stuck. She seeks guidance from her cat, Alfie, but he proves less than helpful. Elly’s mom (Catherine O’Hara) offers to help brainstorm, so Elly hops on a train with Alfie in tow. It’s on this journey where she meets real-life spy Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who tells her that her life is in danger. Elly’s novels have somehow managed to predict geopolitical events and real spy activities. A secret organization wants to kidnap Elly and force her to write the next chapter. Aidan is her only chance at survival. Director Matthew Vaughn is most known for Kingsman: The Secret Service. It’s a slick, stylistic spy flick that spurred a sequel and a prequel, although neither reached the same heights as the first movie. The same can be said for Argylle. Vaughn’s latest is torn between being a romantic adventure comedy and a twist-turny spy caper. What made Kingsman come alive were the action sequences, the sharply written dialogue, and the use of music to elevate the fight scenes. Argylle is trying to capture that same lightning-in-a-bottle essence, but it’s missing the almost manic sensibility. The Argylle trailer claims that the film comes from the “twisted mind” of Vaughn, but it’s fairly reserved. After the Kingsman scene of Colin Firth fighting an entire church set to “Free Bird,” the bar is quite high. Argylle tries to create some of that magic again with a ballet and ice-skating fight scene for the climax, but it comes across very stilted. It’s as though someone is trying to replicate the thrill of Vaughn’s previous works without fully understanding how to go about doing that. It’s not just the fight sequences either. There’s a distinct lack of chemistry among the characters. The script doesn’t offer anything interesting for Elly and Aidan to banter playfully about other than Alfie the cat and Aidan’s allergies. Even then, both are quickly forgotten when they don’t service the plot. It’s their central relationship that the film hinges on, but there’s no spark between them to keep Argylle on the rails. What goodwill Argylle does manage to garner in the beginning is fully undone by all the twists the film throws at the audience. The main one was actually spoiled years ago when the movie was initially announced, and another is revealed in the trailer. Fear not, more (fairly obvious) twists are sprinkled throughout, and Vaughn tosses out one in the final scene and a very last one mid-credits. By the end of Argylle, the audience is left feeling as though the movie was made by someone attempting to emulate the style of Kingsman or John Wick, but never fully committing. There’s also an undercurrent of romance that grows as the film progresses, but it seems that Argylle doesn’t want to lean into an action romance. What a shame that ends up being for the film. Tonally, Argylle cannot find its groove. It falters as it desperately tries to one-up itself with a new twist every few minutes. This is not a plea for simplicity, but to streamline the plot so that Argylle could have been wackier, stranger, and goofier. There are glimpses of that version, but the cat came a little too far out of the bag."
"Feb 4, 2024",positive," Elly Conway is the reclusive author of best-selling espionage novels centering on a secret agent named Aubrey Argylle, on a mission to expose an international spy syndicate. But as her books begin to reflect — and predict — actual events in a real espionage organization, all eyes are on her. Conway is swept up into the secret agent world, where she’s faced with endless questions: Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Who is the real Argylle? And will she ever write the next chapter? From director Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class), Argylle boasts a star-studded cast including Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, Samuel L. Jackson, John Cena, Ariana DeBose, Catherine O’Hara, Dua Lipa and, as Elly Conway, Bryce Dallas Howard. Though Reggie “The Reel Critic” Ponder feels the film is a decent foundation for a franchise, actor Sam Rockwell told Variety it “all depends on whether the audience likes what we’ve done.” Hear Reggie Ponder’s thoughts on the film by listening to his review on “The Reel Critic” (don’t worry, no spoilers).

"Feb 4, 2024",neutral," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzBrit filmmaker Matthew Vaughn (“Kingsman Trilogy”/”Kick-Ass”) directs this plodding, preposterous and laborious spy action/comedy thriller. The misfire is performed by a fine star-studded ensemble cast that tries but can’t save this convoluted mess. It’s written with more twists than a fork full of spaghetti by Jason Fuchs. It offers a satirical riff on James Bond (the story is taken from the one that featured Kathleen Turner in the 1984 “Romancing the Stone”). Its comedy is not funny, its CGI is of an inferior quality, its length is too long and its nutty unoriginal story lacks intrigue.  Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), a cat loving pet owner, residing in a cabin in the isolated mountains of Colorado, is almost finished with her latest novel but needs some help she discovers after giving it a public reading. Thereby she’s on a train bound for Chicago to get help on the last chapter from her mother (Catherine O’Hara). She’s traveling with Alfie, her computer generated Scottish fold cat in her backpack, that has a porthole to see the cat.A  passenger is seated near her, who tells her that she’s in grave danger. That person is the rogue agent Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockville). He further tells her that her plot in the latest serial edition about her hero protagonist, the super-spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill, the Brit actor who played Superman), is similar to what’s actually happening in the real world. That the bad guys have the same plot-line she does in her novel, as it involves a similar covert government organization called the Directorate, that’s headed by the corrupt, madman Ritter (Bryan Cranston). The criminal group think Elly has inside information about a flash drive that could expose their evil deeds.Thereby the bad guys are after Elly on the train, who is helped by Aidan to elude them.But nothing in the story is what it seems, as there are numerous plot changes and double-crosses atop of double-crosses. The pic is so illogical that even the fictional agent Argylle shows his face to help Elly bring down the bad guys by subbing for Aidan during his fight sequences.The film is visually stylish and delivers its violent mayhem with cartoonish pizzazz, as in one fight Elly is trapped in the bathroom and we only see what’s happening by who flies past the bathroom door. In a better fight sequence, there’s a shootout amid gorgeous plumes of brightly-colored smoke. Pop singer Dua Lipa plays a murderous femme fatale, working for the Directorate. While the miscast Bryce Dallas Howard shows no talent for the comedy her role requires. Only Rockville’s quirky performance is entertaining. This ridiculous escapist movie was filmed with no restraint for its excesses. Its so poorly edited that you couldn’t escape from its nonsense without exiting the movie theater. "
"Feb 4, 2024",negative,"Argylle is written terribly in certain spots. When it came to getting these characters out of dangerous situations, they always had a lazy last-minute save that didn't make any sense. "
"Feb 4, 2024",negative," Argylle is exhausting. There is plenty of terrific stuff, including a charmingly bubbly performance by star Bryce Dallas Howard that’s reminiscent —or maybe a crafty amalgamation — of what Kathleen Turner brought to the screen in 1984’s Romancing the Stone or Deborah Kerr achieved in 1950’s King Solomon’s Mines. There’s also an unsurprising and effortlessly amiable turn from Sam Rockwell. If someone made an adult-oriented, 90-minute rom-com with the pair, I’d be first in line to give it a look. But at nearly 140 minutes, this action-mystery-thriller-comedy hybrid doesn’t know when to quit. The film showcases all of director Matthew Vaughn’s best and worst tendencies, with a truly great scene immediately followed by two or three more that frequently ran the gamut from unnecessarily pointless to adolescently puerile to outright unredeemable. I was offended and enthralled in almost equal measure, and if not for the fact that the final 30 minutes left me cold, I’d almost recommend watching this catastrophically outlandish adventure, if only because the experience is so bewilderingly — and at times agonizingly — unique. Like some sort of adolescent remix of ideas covered by any number of authors (but most notably James Thurber, Philip K. Dick, Richard Condon, and Robert Ludlum), screenwriter Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman, Pan) delivers a convoluted story involving a popular writer of espionage fiction and perky cat-lover Elly Conway (Howard) who suddenly finds herself living out one of her own adventures. She’s delivered four books revolving around an unstoppable secret agent named “Argylle,” and all of them have been massive hits. Problems arise when Elly is on the threshold of delivering her eagerly anticipated fifth entry in the series. But before she can finish the final chapters, a bevy of actual spies show up on a train, trying to kidnap her. She’s saved by Aidan Wilde (Rockwell), and in between fists, bullets, some shattered glass, and even a bona fide explosion, he explains to Elly why her life is inexplicably in danger: her Agent Argylle stories really happened. Vaughn leans into the same sort of visual aesthetic he utilized for his Kingsman trilogy, only this time he blurs fantasy and reality several steps past that. The reason is that Elly has trouble differentiating between the dream world of her fictional characters (portrayed by the likes of John Cena, Dua Lipa, Ariana DeBose. Richard E. Grant, and Henry Cavill as Agent Argylle himself) and the suddenly chaotic real ones led by Rockwell, Bryan Cranston (as the power-mad Director Ritter, head of a rogue intelligence agency), Samuel L. Jackson (as the retired former head of the CIA), and a sublime Catherine O’Hara (as Ruth, Elly’s cheerfully domineering mother). It’s a solid idea, and Vaughn does get some decent mileage out of playing with it. The first large-scale action sequence has Rockwell and Cavill continually switching places, as every time Elly blinks, she imagines her suave, classically attractive fictional hero throwing the punches the foul-mouthed, comically unkempt Aidan is actually trading with a never-ending cadre of lethal adversaries. A few visual glitches notwithstanding, the entire set piece is marvelously shot by cinematographer George Richmond (Free Guy) and edited by the team of Tom Harrison-Read (Tomb Raider) and Lee Smith (Dunkirk), and the film’s talented stunt team is deserving of applause. But Vaughn doesn’t know when to quit. His cartoonish presentations and rapid cuts between Elly and Aidan on the run, Agent Argylle’s imaginary domain, Director Ritter’s secret lair (which is more reminiscent of Austin Powers than James Bond), and a tranquil, picturesque French winery gave me whiplash. The noticeably CG-heavy sets and locations are garish, like something out of a PlayStation or Xbox video game (and not a recent one). There is a repetitiveness to the action that’s sadly obnoxious. And don’t get me started on the running gags involving Elly’s adorable cat Alphie, who spends most of the narrative being carted around in a designer, pet-friendly backpack. Then there are the “twists” and “turns.” Without giving any hints, Vaughn and Fuchs take far too long to finally spill beans about their biggest mystery, and by the time they do, I’d long since figured it out, so their revelation hit with a resounding thud. Worse, once the truth is revealed, this gives Vaughn license to play to his baser instincts, reveling in acts of cruelty and violence that feel like sensationalism for its own sake, a trait that also afflicted Kingsman: The Golden Circle and The King’s Man (and in my opinion made both borderline unwatchable). There are a pair of insane sequences inside Director Ritter’s headquarters — one with multicolored gas bombs and another involving MacGyvered ice skates and a floor covered in crude oil — that come tantalizingly close to being as fun as they are obviously meant to be. But much like everything else in this picture, Vaughn lets them run on far too long. Each goes from being goofily amusing to annoyingly tiresome, and that’s too bad. If only because Howard is just so gosh-darn wonderful as the film’s plucky protagonist, I really do want to cut Argylle some slack. But so much of it is far too bludgeoning. By the time the climax rolls around, there’s so little differentiation between Elly’s imaginative literary domain and the supposedly “real” life-or-death one that my emotional investment in anyone’s survival — including hers — was practically nil.

"Feb 4, 2024",positive," The loopy spy caper Argylle has more plot twists and jackknifes than the Fast & Furious franchise. Tug on any thread, and you’ll get a hole. Yet with director Matthew Vaughn, best known for Kick-Ass and the Kingsman films, one expects foolishness. This isn’t Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—or even The Spy Who Loved Me. Argylle is preposterous and messy, but I’ve seen worse, and without the good cheer of Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell. It’s pitched at a heightened reality with cartoonish stunts, over-the-top action, zany dance choreography, and disco music. I doubt I’ll see another sequence this year with someone on jerry-rigged knife-blade ice skates slaying enemies in a sit-spin, or people twirling in a gunfight among smoke canisters that bloom into technicolor hearts. The cockamamie setup sees Howard (Jurassic World Dominion) as Elly Conway, a wildly successful author drawn into some real life-or-death stuff. It’s like Romancing the Stone (or any of its 1980s imitators), except instead of romance, Elly writes espionage novels about secret agent Argylle (Henry Cavill, The Witcher, sporting a green velvet suit and a flat-top haircut) on the trail of a rogue spy agency. On the cusp of her latest novel’s release, a real rogue agency wants to kill or capture Elly because her books mirror their hunt for a flash drive containing the goods to expose their evildoings. We never learn what those are, and this agency hasn’t been able to lay its hands on this device in five years, so they don’t exactly inspire fear. Bryan Cranston (Asteroid City) tries, scowling and barking at underlings clacking on keyboards when they’re not pursuing Elly. Enter Sam Rockwell (See How They Run) as Aiden, a rogue operative from said agency, who rides to Elly’s rescue to reach the widget first. He’s in league with Samuel L. Jackson (The Marvels) as an ex-CIA guy. Jackson has a hideout at a French winery where he spends part of the movie watching basketball, like a low- key Nick Fury. Rockwell’s shaggy-dog screwball demeanor and his penchant for dancing inspire much of the comedy, literally butting up against Elly’s idea of a suave superspy. In an early fight scene, editors Tom Harrison-Read and Lee Smith cut between Rockwell kicking butt (and getting his handed to him) while Elly’s brain toggles between this rough-and-tumble fellow and Cavill, winking, dodging, and decking. Aiden has his own particular set of skills, though. He leaps up through wooden floorboards and takes out operatives better than Trinity in The Matrix, then demonstrates how to smash a skull while doing a little soft shoe. Elly grated on me at first. She has an overbearing mother (Catherine O’Hara, Pain Hustlers) nagging her to find a date, wears pajamas while working, talks to and snuggles her cat, and runs and squeals once the trouble starts. Howard has a natural warmth and an endearing charm that helps smooth over this, but I thought the accomplished director (Dads, The Mandalorian) deserved better. Happily, Elly evolves, but couldn’t screenwriter Jason Fuchs (I Still See You) avoid such creaky sexist stereotypes? Knowing Argylle’s biggest twist, the film could’ve been a lot wackier, especially in the relationships between Cavill and the underused John Cena and Ariana De Bose as the fictional spy’s backup. That said, it’s fun enough if you let the lunacy roll. Valerie Kalfrin is an award-winning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at RogerEbert.com, In Their Own League, Script, The Hollywood Reporter, and other outlets. Also a screenwriter and script consultant, she’s passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability. Let’s tell better stories and tell stories better."
"Feb 4, 2024",positive," Matthew Vaughn is back with his weird director self in Argylle, and I’m not mad about it. Wondering if Argylle is kid friendly? This comedic spy thriller is appropriately rated PG-13. But there are some things to watch for if younger viewers want to get in on this action. Here’s what parents need to know in this Argylle Parents Guide. Bryce Dallas Howard stars as Elly Conway, the reclusive author of a series of best-selling espionage novels, who just wants to hang at home with her computer and cat, Alfie. But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books (and the characters) seemingly come to life, she realizes they may want her dead. Her fictional secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate isn’t so fictional after all.  There is a lot of language in Argylle including uses of sh*t, bullsh*t, a**, a**hole, damn, bi*ch, and f*ck. There are also uses of Deity including g-d, Jesus, and g-ddamn. There is no nudity in Argylle. However, there are a couple of sexual innuendos and characters are seen kissing. There is also some provocative dancing. Sexual content is kept PG-13.  As far as content is concerned, Argylle is kid friendly for ages 13 and older. A lot of Vaughn’s movies are usually rated R, so we do get toned down blood and gore. Language is heavy. Argylle is a ton of fun, but also chaotic and bizarre. It’s the ridiculousness that makes me laugh and that’s what’s so entertaining. I’m not sure why it doesn’t annoy me like other movies do when they go off the rails, but if you’re not into weird, then you probably won’t be into it. Packed with plenty of star power, Argylle doesn’t quite utilize them to their full potential. And the CGI, well, it’s a little messy. I love a good globe-trotting adventure when I can at least ogle the scenery. But I wasn’t ogling too much here. Will teens be into Argylle? If they are into the Kingsman franchise, then they’ll appreciate the cheesiness and humor. And if you really dug the epic fight scene in The King’s Man, then get ready for another one.  Argylle will give you action, romance, comedy, intrigue, twists, turns, and wackiness. What more could you ask for besides a bit of a stronger plot, restraint, better CGI, and cohesion? Psh, tomato tomahto. "
"Feb 4, 2024",negative,"There are some jokes that land and a few fun action scenes, but overall the writing is not good, the CGI is terrible, the amount of plot twists is going to give you whiplash, and the movie is way too long."
"Feb 3, 2024",negative," “Argylle” has been so heavily promoted in the UK that people have been joking that the only safe space from the trailer was in the movie itself. The reason it’s being pushed so heavily has on the surface to do with the director Matthew Vaughn trying to re-establish his credibility after the “Kingsman” movies have skidded off the rails. The reason this critic wanted to see it was because of the hype suggested it was an appreciation of the works of a woman writer. But that’s not the case. It’s propaganda in service of claiming art created by artificial intelligence is as good as the real thing. There’s even several scenes featuring “Now and Then”, the “Beatles” “song” built in a sound deck and released in 2023 while pretending to have vocals sung by John Lennon. The whole experience is not even a triumph of bad taste. “Argylle” is a test balloon sent up by a major movie studio to see if we’ll accept AI in movies the way we’ve come to accept CGI. Do not fall for it. If you have been lucky enough to be spared seeing the trailer: author Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard) has enjoyed enough success with her series of thrillers about a spy named Argylle (Henry Cavill, who by taking this part has accepted he’ll never be playing James Bond) that she owns a colossal lakeside house in remote Colorado. She’s finishing the fourth in the series, though her mother (Catherine O’Hara) doesn’t like the ending. So Elly puts her cat in one of those stupid pet backpacks and gets on a train to go see her. A chatty man named Aidan (Sam Rockwell) plops himself across from her and then proceeds to kill about a dozen people who are trying to kill Elly first. It’s all so cleanly choreographed and with such bad CGI that there’s nothing to be felt watching it, but since we’re supposed to pretend, Elly and Aidan end up on the run together, pursued by a secret agency led by Bryan Cranston that thinks the Argylle books are a secret predictive spy code, or something. Mostly you’ll wonder why they went to all the trouble of having the cat be a CGI creation. Though the fact Aidan is able to spirit Elly over multiple international borders without her having a passport is a head-scratcher, too. That’s enough of the plot, which contains enough fake-outs, gratuitous death, underuse of really interesting actresses (namely Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa and Sofia Boutella) and bad guys with such bad aim they couldn’t hit the side of a barn if they were strapped to it to not be interesting on any level. The only fresh sequence –  of combat ice skating, done in an engine room slick with spilled oil by someone using knives strapped to shoes as ad-hoc blades – loses all its intrigue thanks to enough digital fakery to completely remove any sense of threat. But the plot is driven by the sense that Elly’s imagination is a predictive resource for real-life spy intrigue, while the intrigue itself is a pastiche of approximately a thousand other thrillers, with modern surveillance culture thrown in on top.  Which brings us back to the movie’s main purpose: to treat Elly’s brain as the ultimate AI machine, where hints from her mother, plot suggestions over email from so-called fans, and copious old-fashioned book research combine by some magical mysterious process that’s never called talent to enable Elly to write her smash hits. (We’ll ignore the fact that the plot as written plays a ludicrously slow long game; surely they could just have had Elly discussing her book ideas on TikTok instead of actually writing anything, which also seems to be the present literary way.) But even as the movie goes on, and on and on, about what a clever genius she is, Jason Fuchs’ screenplay is also very keenly like the notorious tweet where someone called writers “ideas landlords.” Didn’t you know? Artists have no right to keep their own idea to themselves when there are other people who want to profit from them.  So this is where we are in the current moment. Ideas are such valuable currency that dozens of faceless henchmen die to keep Elly and her ideas alive, but at the same time Elly’s ideas really belong to the people who suggested them to her. And that explains why they had to push the trailer so hard: without this being forced down our throats we’d never choose to swallow it. People who really love art don’t want it made by machines. They want art made by people. Irritating, demanding, sparky people. Unpredictable people. If “Argylle” becomes a success that’s what we’ll lose."
"Feb 3, 2024",neutral," When I first saw Argylle’s trailer, it reminded me of Sandra Bullock’s 2022 comedy The Lost City where she too played a reclusive romance author who got swept up in an adventure with her novel’s cover model. Well, the plot of Matthew Vaughn’s latest movie centers on Elly Conway, an introverted female author of a very popular spy book series starring secret agent Argylle. Somehow her novel hits too close to reality, involving a sinister global spy syndicate. The trailer makes it out to be a wish-fulfillment fantasy for Henry Cavill’s fans who desperately want to see him as James Bond, though the British super spy wouldn’t ever be caught dead sporting such a goofy haircut! Cavill basically acts like suave 007 in the opening scene, with Dua Lipa doing her best Bond girl audition in a slinky gold dress. The nod to Bond movies is obvious, think of Roger Moore’s tongue-in-cheek version but ten times sillier. Speaking of Bond, while Goldfinger’s got Pussy Galore, Argylle has an actual pussycat, Elly’s Scottish Fold Alfie that she carries in her argyle backpack. It’s amusing to see Bryce Dallas Howard in an action comedy. She’s no stranger to action flicks with the Jurassic World franchise, I mean who could forget her running away from a T-Rex in high heels! But here she gets to flex her comedic muscles as well, though she’s often relegated to looking discombobulated as she gets dragged kicking and screaming into a high-octane action adventure. The first meet-up on the train of Elly and Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), who claims to be a real spy, is a mix between the train scene in Casino Royale (where Bond trade banters with Vesper) and the insane fight scenes of Bullet Train. Howard and Rockwell are fun to watch together, with the latter being the clear MVP just for his smooth dance moves alone. Now, as the adventure kicks into high gear with ceaseless twists and turns along the way, the movie practically veers into the fast-paced screwball comedy genre a la Naked Gun, Hot Shots, or Johnny English. So your enjoyment of the movie depends on how you feel about those movies. I kind of had an inkling what kind of movie this was going to be when I watched Bryan Cranston’s interview with Stephen Colbert where he said his inspiration for his villain character Ritter is Steve Carrell’s Gru from the Minion franchise. ‘Nuf said. Known for his R-rated action movies, i.e. Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and The Kingsman franchise, Vaughn certainly has a thing for clandestine society/organization. The movie’s tagline, Once you know the secret don’t let the cat out of the bag, seems to be a hint for early viewers. Not to worry, you won’t find spoilers here. What I can say is, Vaughn’s brand of spy actioner looks to have diminishing returns. X: Men First Class is one of my favorites in the X-Men franchise, definitely one of the smartest superhero movies to date. I love the first Kingsman movie, Kingsman: The Secret Service, it’s stylish, edgy, witty, and fun that makes a star out of Taron Egerton, but the last two lack the ingenuity of the original. The third Kingsman movie aims for a clever revisionist history but the result is an uneven, tonally-off action thriller. Argylle has the potential to be a clever spin on the spy genre, but despite the dynamic action sequences, the movie is bogged down by the overly elaborate plot and cartoonish humor. The script by Jason Fuchs (who got a story credit for Wonder Woman) keeps the movie in constant topsy-turvy mode, attempting to be one step ahead of viewers’ expectations. Vaughn doubles down on the ridiculous action scenes, accompanied by retro 80s pop music. Electric Energy, a disco pop song featuring Boy George and Ariana DeBose (who has a small role in the movie) is catchy and I have to admit some of the bombastic actions are amusing. There’s the lovers’ dance/shootout amidst rainbow-colored smoke bombs ice-skating, followed by Elly’s ludicrous ice, er oil-skating sequence (by attaching knives to her shoes) as she gleefully takes out multiple baddies. As imaginative as Vaughn is with the casting, i.e. Catherine O’Hara as Elly’s mother who, akin to every character here is much more than meets the eye, this brainless caper also wastes the immense talent of so many Oscar winners/nominees. Samuel L. Jackson is basically just having a good time playing his mischievous self, but I wish there were more John Cena as he’s got more charisma than pretty boy Cavill. The movie’s scene stealer is Alfie the cat, whose real name is Chip. The gray feline, who reminds me of the Bond franchise’s Blofeld’s Persian cat, actually belongs to Vaughn’s wife Claudia Schiffer. Argylle gets exhausting after a while and the jokes become repetitive and less funny as the movie goes on and on needlessly for 2 hours and 19 minutes. I kind of tuned out by the climactic fight scene, let’s just say some elements remind me of a major plot in Marvel’s Captain America movies. If you stick around long enough for the post-credit scene, you’ll find out that Vaughn has plans to expand his spy-themed universe by mixing Argylle with his Kingsman franchise, with potential crossover later on. Can’t say I’m clamoring for more of this type of risible spy thriller that’s absurdly expensive to make (it costs $200 million to make before marketing!) with not much to show for it. No wonder the movie is released on the dumping ground month before it heads for streaming on Apple TV+. What I do want to see more of is Sam Rockwell in more action comedies, hopefully in something with much better material worthy of his talent. When I saw trailer of this, I thought it was some sort of perfume commercial and not a real movie. Lol! I don’t know if I want to waste my time on watching this after seeing two terrible action comedies that Apple TV produced, Ghosted and The Family Plan. A perfume commercial!! Mwahahaha!! Well, Cavill won’t ever get a job in any perfume commercial with THAT haircut, ahah, it’s even dumber than the movie! Yeah, I dodged the bullet w/ Ghosted and The Family Plan thanks to you, sorry Ted!! This film is getting some lukewarm reviews as I think it tries to do too much.  Yes, that is a terrible haircut for Henry Cavill. Only made $18 million in its opening weekend against a $200 million budget.   Unless word of mouth is good like Elemental did when it flopped in its first weekend only to come back because of word of mouth.  This film is FUCKED! Film is in my blood.

"Feb 3, 2024",positive,"Despite the narrative and length-wise excesses, it achieves the mission of dazzling your senses and detonating laughter. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Feb 3, 2024",positive," A loose genre I’d call ‘star-studded fun’ is making a comeback, and boy does it not mix with our sarcastic, unimpressed times. “Serious” film critics (in reality, we are not a serious lot) always turned their noses up at these movies. They’re too obviously low-brow, too winky at the audience. Regular filmgoers, who have always turned up for these movies, don’t need them as much, either. They have regular access to even the biggest celebrities, so seeing them all smooshed together onscreen, whether at awards shows or in cast-driven movies, doesn’t carry the same thrill it used to. And yet we’re getting a new round of Hercule Poirot movies. And the bevy of straight-to-streaming larks like Red Notice and The Gray Man. And now, Argylle. Argylle’s fleet-footed spy hijinks are more of a kind with Red Notice, and it will stream on Apple TV+ shortly. But first, the behemoth gets a theatrical release, which begs the question, what are its aspirations? Like so many Red Notices before it, it’s not worth the price of a movie ticket, but a lazy afternoon stream in a few months? Sure. So why the theatrical run? Argylle is convoluted but simple enough to be diverting. It starts out with a stylish, sexy spy mission where Henry Cavill’s Argylle is sniffed out and everything devolves into a “thrilling” chase. The cheese and poor CGI is so egregious that your hackles might rise. But wait! Turns out this is an excerpt from the hit Argylle books, and everything you’ve seen comes from the mind of its author, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard). Things settle into a more palatable level of absurd clichés in the film’s “real” world. Elly is a single, anxious cat lady living through the adventures she creates. But then she’s pulled into the real world of espionage by Sam Rockwell’s Aidan, who says her books are so on point that she’s calling out real spy world events. And on and on and on the twists come. None are overly surprising and some veer into tiresome, but none are rested on too long to grind things to a halt. The twists mean a huge cast of characters come and go, a perfect setup for your favorite stars to come to set for a few days and churn out a couple scenes. The main joy, or at least curiosity, of seeing Argylle with other people is hearing everyone react to their favorites. My heart, though, belongs to the film’s main duo. To be clear, I love Sam Rockwell. There’s a running joke about how unimpressive Rockwell’s Aiden is compared to the suaveness of Cavill’s Argylle, but give me a scruffy goof over suave any day. Every one of Rockwell’s head tilts elevate the thoroughly meh Argylle, and without him the movie would’ve been a loss. Bryce Dallas Howard is comfortably pleasant here as well, and together the pair strike tones and poses that have more personality than the by-the-numbers script deserves. Proving that they’re the ones making the material and not the other way around, the film gives both a late “glow-up”, intending to make them look and act more like glamorous spies, and I almost revolted. I mean, whatever poofing they did to Rockwell’s hair was bad enough, but making Howard A BLONDE? No. This plot twist marks the beginning of the end of Argylle’s fun. Not only does it start thoroughly wasting the charm of its two leads, but it spins the tone too far into director Matthew Vaughn’s endless attempt to recapture Kingsman’s glory. The first Kingsman, to be clear. Neither the sequel nor prequel lived up to the zany energy of the original, and neither does the climax of Argylle, as much as it wants to. These sequences feel like they’re from an entirely different movie than Argylle, not just unnecessary but jarring and deflating. The rest of the movie had zipped by with a pleasantly medium level of energy. Its sudden reach for wacky, elaborate action is not what a lazy afternoon movie needs. If Argylle had peppered in this energy earlier it would’ve felt of a piece, and perhaps the film would’ve earned its big-screen release. As is, all that money and all those stars only add up to a mildly entertaining romp. It’s not enough of a mess to be mad at, maybe because I can’t be mad at this much Sam Rockwell goodness, but I was certainly left wanting a better ending. And more Sam Rockwell."
"Feb 3, 2024",positive," Matthew Vaughn put a fresh spin on the spy genre with his film Kingsman: The Secret Service. He’s back at with a new spy character who is full of surprises in Argylle. Henry Cavill makes for the quintessential spy with his dashing good looks, British accent, and the ability to take anyone down. He’s got his team ready to help behind the scenes to aid in his escape plan. They’re played by John Cena and Ariana DeBose.  He can get out of any situation as he has for four different adventures. See, they’re characters in a spy novel series written by Elly Conway whose played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She’s out promoting her fourth novel while putting the finishing touches on the fifth book. Elly’s books have oddly predicted what happens in the real espionage world. She finds herself caught up in a real spy adventure when she meets Sam Rockwell’s character on a train who tells her she’s in grave danger and that a sinister group is out to use her to predict where some dangerous codes and files could be located. She finds herself in way over her head as life imitates art, and she has no one to trust except her cat, Alfie. -Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle is meant to be taken as a wild, twisty nod to the spy genre that acknowledges all the tropes and silly characters along the way. Vaughn certainly leans into this from the beginning with its bombastic, Fast and the Furious-style chase sequences that defy any sense of logic. -Every actor seems in on the style and is clearly having a blast leaning into the heightened acting that comes with the genre. Vaughn lets them play into what they do best from Bryan Cranston leaning into the evil leader type, Catherine O’Hara gets to add her quirks as the overbearing mother, and Sam Rockwell brings his usual brand of wackiness. -The first half of Argylle works well as I was still piecing this all together. Director Matthew Vaughn lets his own ego get in the way in the second half which comes with one too many twists and a completely bonkers climax. It’s almost as if he wanted to see how many surprises and reveals he could throw out. Some of them work, but it often just meant additional shoot outs and action sequences which makes for a bloated runtime. -Vaughn has a fun voice for the spy genre as we’ve seen with his Kingsman movies and now Argylle. There’s potential for this to be a franchise, as Argylle will certainly keep you guessing until the very end. Vaughn needs to remember that less is more in the meta approach he gave this film.  Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor gives a deeply moving performance for the in Origin which should not be missed. Writer/director Ava DuVernay has frequently tackled the subjects of racism, politics, and the systems at play with films and series like Selma, 13th, and When They See Us. Now she’s tackling the life of Pulitzer Prize winning author Isabel Wilkerson whose played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor. DuVernay sets her film in the backdrop of the murder of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman. Isabel is approached to write about the murder, but she feels conflicted as its not where she feels her career is at after writing her first book, “The Warmth of Other Suns” that won her the Pulitzer. She wants to have the answers and feel a part of the story instead of asking the questions. Within a short time, she is faced with unimaginable grief after the death of two loved ones. It’s a time when she feels like she has no one left in life and pours her grief into her work. She starts to probe into the differences between racism and caste and the connection she finds between Jim Crow laws and Nazi Germany. -Ava DuVernay takes a unique approach in adapting Wilkerson’s book “Caste” which became a massive bestseller in 2020 after the death of George Floyd. This isn’t a direct adaptation of the Wilkerson’s concepts but rather takes us into the personal journey she had during this tumultuous time in her life. -This angle allows the audience to see inside the author’s mindset when it seems like there’s nothing left to offer the world and to then trying to understand something so monumental. -The first three quarters of the film dives into her research but DuVernay knows the audience will have a greater impact by understanding the visuals as part of her history lesson. She makes Isabel’s research come alive as she takes the audience into Nazi conference rooms, concentration camps, and life in India under their caste systems. -Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor commands the screen at every point giving Isabel a hard outer shell despite that personal pain and heartbreak she’s feeling in the inside. – Origin is reminder that no matter where we are at in life, there’s always room for growing and understanding. This is a history lesson by way of one person’s learning versus an academic history book approach. Mean Girls became a cult classic after its release in 2004. It lead to a hit Broadway musical that is currently being performed by high schools across the country. The Plastics are back at it as now it’s been adapted as a movie musical. Tina Fey wrote the original film and is back again penning the screenplay for the new movie which takes the same plot and characters we love but places them in present day instead of 2004. Angourie Rice plays, Cady, a new transplant to North Shore High School after her mom moves them to the US from Kenya. Cady makes friends with Janice and Damian, they’re the two outcasts at school who introduce her to all the cliques at school. One clique is The Plastics, three mean girls led by the queen bee, Regina George. She’s played by Renee Rapp, who also played the part on Broadway. Janice and Damian convince Cady to infiltrate the Plastics and at the same time she starts to fall for Aaron Samuels, who happens to be Regina’s ex. -There will be a lot of comparisons to the original film, but directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. and their cast have really tried to make this their own version of this story. -If you don’t know the music, you may find yourself grooving to the songs even if they seem a bit shortened than their original Broadway versions. They feel a bit tightened up much like I felt about the songs in The Color Purple. Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. treat the numbers like altered realities, dream sequences like in Chicago where the lighting dims and the ensemble comes alive in different ways. -Tina Fey’s script captures the snark she wrote in the first film, plays with some of the iconic lines, and uses social media as a big part of the story when that wasn’t as prevalent back in 2004. There’s a #ReginaChallenge that goes viral. –Mean Girls is an entertaining pop movie musical that doesn’t need the audience to have seen the original film or know the Broadway musical to appreciate what this cast brings to the material. The quirky characters and high school lessons should appeal to a new generation."
"Feb 3, 2024",negative," Argylle promised a slick, quick-witted spy adventure helmed by Henry Cavill’s smooth operator to its audiences – but sadly that is not what it delivers. Despite a star-studded supporting cast featuring the likes of Samuel L Jackson, John Cena and Dua Lipa and filmmaker Matthew Vaughn’s own cat Chip, these are also things that the $200million (£158m) film fails to deliver. Vaughn has a lot of fans of his work in this genre thanks to the popularity of the Kingsman franchise, but it’s not a bar he reaches near with a stab at his own original story in Argylle. The concept has such promise with Cavill’s Agent Argylle the fictional creation of introverted author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), whose uncanny knack for mirroring the actions of a real-life spy organisation in her books gets her into trouble in real life. Rescuing her and her cat Alfie (the aforementioned Chip) from a case of writer’s block and a train full of bad guys then kicks off a globe-trotting adventure into a covert world where nothing and no one are what they seem. However, Argylle has somewhat hoodwinked its expectant fan base with its Cavill-heavy marketing campaign, as well as that argyle-printed cat backpack carrier they are determined will have its moment. Yes, the Superman star is in the film, but it’s very much not his film. He’s a fictional creation that acts and speaks in the manner of meek, homely Elly’s writing and yes, it’s a clever idea but one Vaughn could have (and should have) had a lot more fun with. And with regards to the much-hyped nepo cat, nothing is exciting there other than the distracting amount of time he spends in his carrier. Vaughn has utterly wasted the teased opportunity to deliver his cat character to feline fame and fortune. There are other red herrings too with who’s important in the cast, as some actors are just rocking up for glorified cameos (not necessarily a bad thing in Dua Lipa’s case, I’m sorry to say). Samuel L Jackson has played variations on his character here so many times it’s dizzying, and certainly more famously in the Marvel movies. Argylle’s leads are really Howard and Rockwell, delivering a sort of watered-down version of Romancing the Stone’s odd couple pairing, which was one of Vaughn’s inspirations. The actors themselves do a decent job with what they’re given – especially the ever-enjoyable Rockwell – but it’s not a double act to rival the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. A lot of this is down to Vaughn’s over-reliance on big stunt scenes and set pieces. These are, of course, an integral part of the genre, but its off-putting over-reliance on CGI enhancement is clear from just minutes in when Dua Lipa dashes down a windy road on a motorbike with uncanny ease. There are some stand-out moments, including an imaginative use of skating, but there’s also a lot of the same bullet spraying, head kicking and leg-splaying on the dancefloor throughout. One bright spot is the welcome inclusion of Catherine O’Hara as Elly’s mother Ruth, and Bryan Cranston as Argylle’s baddie. They both seem the most aware of the type of film they’re in, amping it up to 11 at every opportunity. O’Hara doesn’t necessarily have the snappiest of dialogue (a problem for all of them), but she is determined you’ll chortle nonetheless in what is her action film debut. It works as an entertaining piece of escapism, but nothing beyond that with the way it’s been crafted. The suggestion that this could be a fresh take on spy films is proven unfulfilled when Argylle had the potential to do what it did much better.

"Feb 3, 2024",negative,"(It's) long, loud, lousy, and brazenly absurd after a somewhat seductive start."
"Feb 3, 2024",negative," Looking back at all the marketing materials for Argylle, the very concept of the movie is a bait and switch. Rewind back to July 2021, when Apple Films first announced the movie. The project was described as a novel that follows the exploits of a globe-trotting super-spy named Argylle from a book written by Ellie Conway. At the time, director Matthew Vaughn claimed that this movie was going to “reinvent the spy genre.” Well, Argylle fails to do that on every level. Additionally, Argylle fails to exist as a halfway-decent movie. In dissecting that original story, the whole concept of Argylle as a movie and franchise is built around the “author” Elly Conway, who is a character in the film. The real author behind the book(s) written for the film remains anonymous. In the world of the motion picture, writer Elly Conway, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard in the film, is a world-renowned author famous for writing a spy novel series based around its eponymous hero, Agent Argylle (Cavill). Agent Argylle is a character in a world within the world of the actual film. Elly Conway is a fictional concoction, probably built as part of a transmedia campaign to enable Argylle to break into multiple markets. An actual Argylle novel about the character referenced in the film has been published. It’s similar to literal books published by the fictional author Richard Castle from the ABC television series Castle.  The film opens with Conway touring her latest spy novel in the Argylle series, followed by an imaginary prologue depicting Henry Cavill as a 007-wannabe looking utterly ridiculous with a flat-top, Arnold Schwarzenegger haircut. Together with his trusted partner, Wyatt (Cena), they apprehend the “terrorist” LaGrange (Dua Lipa), but they discover that their organization has gone rogue. Conway is a celebrated, successful writer for her books, and she’s already hard at work on her next installment. But as she’s taking a road trip via train home to visit her mother, Ruth (O’Hara), to rework the final act, she meets a scruffy passenger, Aidan (Rockwell), who turns out to be a master spy. Rescuing Conway from a group of vicious, unruly thugs disguised as train riders, the duo makes an epic escape. It turns out that the fiction of Conway’s novels becomes real, and there is a rogue spy network out there with bad intentions. Aidan seeks Elly’s help to expose The Directorate and its megalomaniacal leader, Ritter (Cranston). Unfortunately Elly, struggles as the fiction of the world she created starts blending with reality in more ways than one.  From the top down, Argylle has an impressive cast, but Fuchs’ script is a badly cliched, hackneyed mess. Vaughn fails to use his actors to the best of their exceptional talents. The script is full of twists and turns, but all the major plot twists are poorly executed and thought out. None of them make any sense. The portrayal of Cranston as an unhinged villain and the head of a rogue spy network should be fun. Instead, Vaughn depicts Cranston as a two-dimensional, uninteresting character bordering on self-parody. Sam Rockwell valiantly tries to elevate the material with his unique charisma and dry delivery, but his character must deliver copious amounts of banal exposition. The most unfortunate aspect is that Rockwell and Howard share next to no chemistry as the film’s designated pairing. Both Howard and Rockwell are great actors, and the movie significantly hinges on their two character arcs. However, they can’t ignite the screen with what should be a compelling, whirlwind romance.  Creating a story where an author becomes embroiled in a real-life crisis is not exactly a novel concept. Argylle fails to do anything new or different from that concept, other than a parade of nonsensical plot twists that add little actual intrigue. Not to mention, most of the plot twists play as ideas cut and pasted from more recent works.  What’s worse about Argylle, despite a reported budget of $200 million, is that its look and visual style reek of cheapness. Every major action and set piece looks heavily layered under bad CGI and digital trickery, not the least of which are multiple stunts involving Alfie the Cat, portrayed partially by Vaughn’s real-life pet feline, Chip. Alfie becomes an active player in the plot and action, which means significant amounts of execrable computer-generated feline imagery. Vaughn has always had a penchant for going over the top with his action scenes, and he does so again here. The problem is that the two crazy, synthetic action sequences that happen late in the film only add to its flaws. The action scenes could’ve been salvaged had they looked more authentic, but they crush the immersion of the film’s hyper-realized world.  Combined with the fictionalized concept behind the premise, the movie heavily pushes the “new” song by The Beatles, “Now and Then,” and Vaughn extensively and shoddily rehashes his previous work. Argylle symbolically encompasses what a movie built by AI and algorithms probably looks like, a synthetic, hodge-podge mess with zero charm or inner life. However, the most infuriating aspect of Argylle is the ending sequence followed by a head-scratching mid-credit scene. If the film’s goal was to push forth a new franchise or shared universe, it’s one of the worst executed attempts in recent memory. With a runtime of about two hours and twenty minutes, Argylle is little more than a synthetic, bloated mess. To steal a quote from Henry Cavill, “It’s like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling.” Copyright © 2024 411mania.com, LLC. All rights reserved.Click here for our privacy policy.

"Feb 3, 2024",negative," It's the ""meh"" films that baffle me. Matthew Vaughn's Argylle is a meh film. The film centers around Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard), an introverted author of spy novels centered around an agent named Argylle (Henry Caville) whose books have somehow become so accurate that they're now predicting global spy events. This attracts the attention of just about, well, everyone and it's only her and a spy named Aidan (Sam Rockwell) who can possibly save her while everyone tries to get their hands on her next novel.  To be completely fair, there are some impressive action sequences to be found in Argylle and there's an impressive ensemble waiting around for the film they likely thought they signed up for to actually manifest. In addition to our leading trio, familiar faces like Catherine O'Hara, Samuel L. Jackson, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston are all here and obviously game for a good time. O'Hara is the film's highlight Elly's mom. She captures a tone that I wish everyone else had followed, an inspired performance lost in a sea of bloated nothingness.  The script by Jason Fuchs is trying way too hard with relentless twists and turns along the way and double-crosses galore. Let's just say that John Wick isn't looking over his should worried about this cinematic drivel. The film lasts at least 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, though I suppose if you're going to make a mega-budgeted film you probably have to show something big on that big screen.  Listen, there's no denying that Matthew Vaughn is a talented director. However, Argylle simply isn't a good film and it's barely a competent one. Here's hoping that Argylle is Vaughn's cinematic lowpoint and he can get back to making stylish, substantial motion pictures that are actually fun to watch. "
"Feb 3, 2024",positive," ‘Argylle’ is an amusing fish-out-of-water picture in which a writer’s life starts to imitate her art when she’s ensnared in one of her espionage stories. Whether comedic or dramatic, spy movies always have the potential to be very entertaining. There’s usually a mystery element to engage audiences and captivating personalities to hold their attention. The hero is often put in impossible life and death situations, forced to find ingenious solutions to survive. The villain has certain stereotypical traits and a tendency to be overconfident that they’ll successfully execute their scheme. There’s also a fair amount of action spread throughout the narrative as the opposing sides repeatedly confront each other. Argylle has all these things and more as a novelist becomes unexpectedly entangled in an espionage venture. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the popular author of a series of spy books featuring the title character, Argylle (Henry Cavill). She’s in the midst of completing her next novel, but has yet to figure out its ending. On route to work it out with her supportive mother (Catherine O’Hara), she’s intercepted by real-life spy Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell) and a group of men trying to kill her. After Aidan rescues Elly and her cat, Alfie, he explains that her novels have uncannily mirrored actual events, making her a priority target for a cloak-and-dagger agency very similar to the one featured in her books and the only way to stop them is to finish her story. Since 2014, director Matthew Vaughn has helmed the Kingsman franchise, releasing a new adventure featuring the gentlemanly spy organization every few years. Although this movie doesn’t appear to have a direct connection to the series, a link is revealed by the end of the film. That said, it does share in all the fun audiences have come to expect from these films, including entertaining fight sequences, humorous character encounters and multiple plot twists. The result is a fast-paced, fun movie that doesn’t feel like 139 minutes because there’s never a dull moment and all the reveals make sense within the narrative, even if some viewers find them predictable. The cast is also impeccable. Howard plays an intelligent woman and burgeoning cat lady, who also happens to be too terrified to practice anything she’s conceived for her books. Rockwell is the charming, rough-around-the-edges knight in shining armor that rescues the damsel in distress, while repeatedly convincing her to push through death-defying situations. Meanwhile, Cavill plays the fictitious, suave secret agent, supported by John Cena and Ariana DeBose. And there’s several other notable cast members, including Bryan Cranston, Dua Lipa, Richard E. Grant and Samuel L. Jackson, who’s roles are best discovered by watching. Alfie the cat plays prominently in the narrative, but the movie really does belong to the wonderful humans who bring the story to life and ensure the time audiences spend in theatre is not wasted.

"Feb 3, 2024",positive," I could write a negative review of Argylle if I wanted to. I could criticize the overstuffed, preposterous story and the central plot twist that’s ripped off from other spy stories. I could complain that the 139-minute running time is too long. I could rage against a nonsensical action scene where a character ice skates on oil. A lot of things about this movie could be faulted. There’s just one problem: doing any of that would betray the fun I had watching the movie. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the author of a best-selling book series about a spy named Argylle. While on a train bound for Chicago to see her mother (Catherine O’Hara), she meets Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that she’s in great danger. Elly’s most recent book has eerily mirrored actual events involving a covert government organization called the Division that’s run by madman Ritter (Bryan Cranston). They think she has inside information about a flash drive that could expose their evil deeds. Aidan attempts to help Elly locate the drive before they do. Henry Cavill portrays a vision of the fictional Argylle she routinely sees during their adventures. That’s a plot synopsis. It does nothing to convey the tone of Argylle. Nothing is quite what it seems. The screenplay by Jason Fuchs tosses in at least half a dozen plot developments that completely change the direction of the story. Crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses abound. Action scenes find characters doing stuff that defies the laws of gravity and physics. Agent Argylle pops in to give Elly advice and reassurance when necessary. In other words, nothing about the movie is linear or logical. And yet, that quality is precisely what makes Argylle entertaining. The film gives itself permission to do literally anything, then takes advantage of that permission by throwing one wild, insane, unpredictable element after another at the audience. We’re in an age where few movies have originality. Everything is based on a previously existing property. Here’s a picture that writes its own rules, devising outlandish scenarios left and right. I found that refreshing. Director Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman: The Secret Service) is known for big, over-the-top action fare. He delivers violent mayhem with awesome visual style. A fight on a train is partially filmed from the POV of Elly as she’s trapped in the narrow bathroom; we only know what’s happening based on who flies past the door at any given second. A later sequence – which is the best thing I’ve seen onscreen so far this year – is a shootout amid beautiful plumes of brightly-colored smoke. That ice skating bit? Well, it’s stupid, but the film is sufficiently committed to its own outrageousness that the idea takes on a giddy quality. There are no boundaries, allowing for the freedom to go anywhere. Lots of other disparate pleasures can additionally be found, from pop singer Dua Lipa as a femme fatale, to the comedic hijinks of Elly’s cat, to the appealingly quirky performances from Rockwell and Howard. Argylle won’t be for everyone. In fact, it may be for a very small subset of people. I’m among them, though. If you have a taste for movies that go for broke, you too might appreciate Vaughn’s playfully gonzo spy adventure. "
"Feb 3, 2024",negative," Argylle—note the second “L,” please—should be investigated for creative embezzlement. There’s just no way a film this stacked with idiosyncratic talent (Sam Rockwell! Catherine O’Hara! Bryan Cranston! Richard E. Grant) can be so relentlessly, thuddingly, punishingly devoid of even the most fleeting molecule of amusement unless it’s all a put-on. I thought of the way the producers in, uh, The Producers created a musical called Springtime for Hitler in an (unsuccessful) attempt to lose eye-watering sums of money. Winking hard enough to give itself an aneurysm, this tediously self-aware spy comedy comes to us “from the twisted mind of”—per the film’s marketing materials—Matthew Vaughn, a Brit with more than a few good movies under his belt. His directing debut, the 2004 crime flick Layer Cake, more or less got its star, Daniel Craig, the role that would take him from being famous in the U.K. to famous all over the world. Vaughn also made 2011’s X-Men: First Class, a swinging ’60s-set prequel that remains one of the two or three best entries in that wildly uneven superhero franchise. More recently, he’s translated the espionage-themed comic-book series Kingsman into three films, finding them to be the ideal platform for a shock-and-awe sensibility that still felt—at least somewhat—surprising when the first entry came out in 2014.  But now, several lifetimes and 200 comic-book movies later, that sensibility is as played out as the 1970s slow jams Vaughn drops over his new film’s bloodless, consequence-free action sequences whenever he wants to signal to us that he’s doing all of this ironically—it’s not that he’s actually out of ideas, he’s just mocking how uninspired his comic-book flick/spy flick contemporaries are. Give me the earnestness of an impossible Mission any day—they’re not just exponentially more thrilling than Vaughn’s sardonic nihilism, they’re funnier, too. The most interesting thing about Argylle is its marketing campaign. Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs are pretending that this is an adaptation of a preexisting and beloved spy novel series created and written by Actual, Genuine, Real Life Person, Elly Conway. The story they’re selling, in the movie’s press notes and on its promotional campaign, is that in the course of adapting Conway’s book, they hit upon the metafictional delight of making Conway herself a central character in the movie, like how Meryl Streep played Susan Orlean in Adaptation. It’s much more likely Elly Conway is the pen name of an author they commissioned to write a single Argylle tie-in novel, which was published last month, as part of the campaign for the movie. (The Conway of Argylle-the-movie is promoting the fourth book in her series, though in our world, you can only purchase and read one.) The Washington Post’s Sophia Nguyen did the gumshoe work of demonstrating that the existence of waitress turned bestselling novelist Elly Conway is almost certainly all Swiftian nonsense, although whether the Swift in question is Jonathan (b. 1667) or Taylor (b. 1989) remains unsettled. Regardless of who—or if—Elly Conway actually is, her Argylle avatar is Bryce Dallas Howard, who is as blameless for the dreadful results here as she was in those three Jurassic World movies. (Those were bad, but not this bad.) Her fictional-or-is-he literary creation, Agent Argylle, is Henry Cavill, given an unflattering flattop and shorn of the considerable charm and comic timing he showed in Guy Ritchie’s underseen The Man From U.N.C.L.E., just to compare cheeky British spy flicks to cheeky British spy flicks.  Cavill has been in good movies and bad ones, but Rockwell—playing the actual spy who informs Elly that her bestselling novels are close enough to reality to make an international terrorist cabal want to kill her—is usually a more astute judge of material than this. Vaughn loves the device of having Elly think she’s watching Cavill do some cool spy shit only to blink and realize it’s really Rockwell handling the action hero derring-do. It’s a C-grade gag the first time Vaughn does it, and it does not get funnier or cleverer with repetition.  Remember when Samuel L. Jackson was one of the most exciting performers in cinema? He shows up for a few minutes, too, presumably lured by the promise of yet another spymaster part that doesn’t require him to act, leave his home, or stand up. If you happen to recall that he played the villain in the franchise-starting Kingsman: The Secret Service, you’ll also recall how much better he was in that than in this. Vaughn’s habit of recycling gags and action sequences, not just from his so-so Kingsman films but within this one movie, pads this turkey to an unconscionable 139 minutes—only 10 minutes shorter than 2001: A Space Odyssey, for crying out loud. Vaughn could shave that by half an hour just by showing us all his digitally glazed slo-mo pursuits and fights sequences at regular speed.  We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read. If you think that it's important to have high quality local reporting we hope you'll support our work with a monthly contribution."
"Feb 3, 2024",negative,"  About a third of the way through Matthew Vaughn's latest film, Argylle, there's a scene in which Catherine O'Hara, as Ruth Conway, talks on the phone with her daughter. The scene stands out not for any particulars of the performance but for the lighting. Until this moment, every scene has been lit like a pharmaceutical commercial: no moody shadows, no shades beyond the queasily bright. In this scene, however, as Ruth speaks with her daughter, there's a rectangular block of light on her torso, blazing in from an unseen window. This blown-out bright spot wouldn't matter if it weren't the only moment in the film to have a bit of reality creeping in. Still, it stands out for seeming to be the only time something real is happening beyond the stifling construction of the film's execution.   Argylle is Vaughn's latest candy-coated foray into the world of double-identities, double- and triple-crosses, spycraft, and general James Bondery, territory that he's found ample material in -- like a kid finding a forgotten Tonka in a sandbox -- with the three Kingsman films that have trickled out of the past few years: The Secret Service (2014), The Golden Circle (2017), and The King's Man (2021). With their share of ecstatic highs and direst of lows, this trio of films largely served as a remedy to the forlorn brutishness of Daniel Craig's Bond films. Vaughn embraced the childish glee of remote bases, gimmick-based villains, and plenty of action (""Free Bird,"" anyone?), which are envisioned with a contemporary lust for hyperviolence and executed with technical implementation that could not have occurred during Sean Connery's seven-film turn as 007.   After an introductory action sequence, Argylle begins, in earnest, with Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), the writer of middle-grade spy fiction, sitting at a table in front of an adoring audience. Elly has just finished her latest book in her Argylle series, about the titular spy (portrayed in live-action sequences involving Henry Cavill) and his sexy, globe-trotting adventures -- stories that she finishes writing by literally saying, ""the end."" (Note: there's no sense that Elly has an editor. She simply finishes a novel, and the world receives it.) One eager audience member puts Elly's name in conversation with ""Fleming, Forsyth, and le Carré,"" a comparison that should irk just about anyone who has read any of the three authors' works, especially in the latter case, but this is still just the beginning.   Aside from the film's questionable sense of literary merit and the narrow-minded conception of what an author actually does, Argylle happily plods along. Sometime later, Elly boards a train. She's headed to her vacation home with cat Alfie in tow, who sits plain-faced within one of those backpacks with an observational bubble. A minor flirtation with a passerby later, Elly finds herself face-to-face with the scraggly Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who looks like anything but Henry Cavill. Despite appearances, Aidan tells Elly they'll have to square off against a litany of adversaries in a few moments. Elly, understandably confused, finds herself in a situation like in her books!   It's not long before it's revealed (not really a spoiler) that Elly's novels have a prescient quality, making her a seer of particular interest to the Division, headed up by the cantankerous, cutthroat Ritter (Bryan Cranston). The Division is after a damning piece of evidence that threatens the organization's very existence. Unfortunately for them, along with Aidan and Elly, the file's exact contents and whereabouts are a mystery because the answer lies in a chapter that Elly has not yet written.   Without ruining the reveals, there's enough in the film's latter half to explain why this particular setup was used. If one got the sense that this was just the wish-fulfillment fantasy of an author who is described as a ""cat lady,"" then they should rest assured it absolutely is that, but there's also a reason behind it. The problem, however, is in how much one has to endure to get to the quadruple-crossing second half and whether there's a reason to care by then. By the time the secrets roll in, the film has already spent most of its good faith.   On paper, Argylle has an intriguing setup. Still, it's the sort of story that stokes the flames of imagination best when it remains an elevator pitch -- unfettered with the problem of having to bring its ideas to life. In the hands of someone like, say, John le Carré, the story could've bore the weight of its initial intrigue with a spinning-plate precision that Argylle sorely lacks -- but le Carré this is not.   It's easy to forget that Vaughn, now far-flung from the orbit of Guy Ritchie (on whose Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, Vaughn produced) -- and his own Ritchie-lite Layer Cake -- used to be the type of filmmaker whose pop-savvy style seemed to built to navigate a range of styles. After his directorial debut shook off the burden of influence, Vaughn became unpredictable.   Stardust (2007), based on Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name, was a beguiling, wink-winking fantasy. Kick-Ass (2010), based on John Romita Jr. and Mark Millar's comic universe, was a brutal vigilante film, scratching the R-rated antihero itch before it was all anyone could talk about. X-Men: First Class (2011) benefitted from having a shiny yellow veneer, capturing the tone of its comic book namesake, and graciously offering a brooding Michael Fassbender performance as a Nazi-hunting Magneto. And, of course, there are the Kingsman films, which, above all else, had an undeniable joy, even if they sometimes felt too absurd to fully get on board with (See: Lenin linking up with Hitler).   With a body of work as eclectic as Vaughn's, one can't help but feel that Argylle is the director operating in cruise mode, settling into a tone that demands very little and offers even less. Sure, there's the allure of Sam Rockwell reintroducing some of his Charlie's Angels (2000) dance moves, and there's a cat (spoiler: it's CGI), but you've seen better versions of everything in this film before -- even in Vaughn's previous work. And, if that's not enough, those other films didn't have the terribly unsettling feeling they were trying to get you to buy a Beatles song on Apple Music.  Hazbin Hotel has introduced a host of amazing new characters for fans to meet. But from Husk to Vaggie, who deserves more in Season 2?"
"Feb 3, 2024",positive,"The spy spoof Argylle is consistently clever, frequently funny and highly entertaining."
