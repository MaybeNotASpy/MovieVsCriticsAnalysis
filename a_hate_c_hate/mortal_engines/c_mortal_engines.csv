"Jun 16, 2021",positive,It's actually a little bit more soulful than it lets on.
"Apr 29, 2021",negative," In the genre of ‘teenagers saving the world in post-apocalyptic wastelands’ ‘Mortal Engines’ is a very odd entry. Its conceit, taken from a successful young-adult novel series from the early 2000s, makes very little sense. After the world was destroyed in a brief, brutal nuclear war, society has rebuilt itself…on wheels. Entire cities have been lifted, somehow, on to massive chassis and hurtle around the scrubby land looking for stuff. How? Not even a suggestion of an explanation. Why? It’s never really clear, beyond it being a good excuse for some whizzy CG. And the CG in this film is very whizzy. Weta Digital have done a fantastic job making this odd world look real. You will believe a teeming metropolis can chase a Bavarian village across the desert. Visually it’s often wondrous. Behind the visuals, though, the machinery is awfully creaky. The Lord of the Rings team of Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson wrote the adaptation. ‘Lord of the Rings’ showed they are brilliant at wrangling rambling story and massive worlds into understandable narrative. That skill has deserted them here. Every plot turn in ‘Mortal Engines’ raises more questions and provides very few answers. Its core character is Hester (Hera Hilmar), a loner assassin fixated on killing Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), who was responsible for the death of her mother. Valentine is a very powerful and well-respected man in London, the largest and apparently most vindictive of the wheeled cities, whose inhabitants don’t know he’s building something sinister in St Paul’s Cathedral. When Hester tries to kill Valentine she’s stopped by Tom (Robert Sheehan), a young man who archives old relics like toasters and televisions. The pair wind up stranded in the wilderness, forging an unlikely alliance as they try to get back to London for very different reasons. While it’s at heart a simple revenge story, the mechanics are often deeply confusing and drearily humorous (only Sheehan raises any kind of adventurous energy). Valentine does all his scheming in secret, so people won’t realise he’s evil. But the residents of London are shown to be so bloodthirsty, shouting and cheering whenever they destroy a smaller city and not remotely objecting when he reveals his grand plan, that he may as well have been above board the whole time. Hester’s backstory is baffling, involving a mother who was, we’re told, vital to those resisting the wheeled cities but also in a relationship with Valentine, neither of which is clearly explained. There’s a zombie assassin that relentlessly tracks Hester, killing hundreds, because…he likes her? The plot is a distant secondary consideration to action set-pieces. There are so many gaps in the storytelling and so much reliance on chance and characters guessing things that it’s never even remotely absorbing or satisfying. It’s a beautifully designed world but no real life exists within it."
"Jan 29, 2021",negative," If a bad film is lucky, it will manage a handful of mediocre reviews, a decent return at the box office and a steadfast retirement into Netflix’s catalog. The problem “Mortal Engines” will face is not that it is “bad” per se. It’s simply not very good, and the parts that aren’t terrible are because you are hopefully seeing it in IMAX, if not on a regular theater screen, and the visuals are enough to keep you mildly entertained. Co-written and produced by Peter Jackson of “Lord of the Rings” fame, “Mortal Engines” is a lifeless fantasy epic that is mildly enjoyable at times, but suffers from several grave afflictions that ultimately incur steep viewing consequences. Based on the 2001 series by Philip Reeve, the film is a sweeping, steampunk look at our post-apocalyptic world after a “Sixty Minute War” ravages the earth, forcing the major cities to find a set of wheels – yes, cities become Monster Truck-type monstrosities – and scour the wastelands for resources, undergoing what is coined “Municipal Darwinism”. London is the principal “Traction City”, dominating and ultimately “devouring” smaller traction cities in order to utilize their resources. Following a high-thrills chase sequence that opens the film, London is undergoing one such feast when a local historian Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) meets Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), a local celebrity who was once a historian as well. Small talk is cut short by a mysterious woman named Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) who inexplicably attacks Valentine and narrowly escapes by ejecting herself off the moving city. Despite his well-meaning intentions, Tom pursues the shadowy girl and inadvertently lifts back the veil on a decades-old secret that makes him a liability and therefore, disposable. Stranded in the harsh tundra, Tom and Hester must work together to reach civilization and stop Valentine’s maniacal plan before the earth is hit with another geo-catastrophic event. Frequently oscillating in tone and aesthetic between Jim Henson (minus the puppets) and other extreme fantasy world-building films like “John Carter” and “Stardust”, “Mortal Engines” is certainly not hard to look at. Director Christian Rivers, a former storyboard artist and visual effects teammate for most of Peter Jackson’s biggest hits, understands what we want to see and, more importantly, how to translate that onto the screen. The colors pop. The world around us swirls. Shot on detailed sets, the beauty is surely in the details. Hundreds of perfectly dressed extras flock through several scenes large-scale scenes including the aforementioned chase sequence. The set of London is surprisingly charming and intimate, and it gives us the sense that we really aren’t in Kansas anymore. Not Kansas in the 21st century, at least. The inventive machines of the future pique our interest, but therein also lies one issue the film struggles to address: the mechanics of the beastly cities are never fully explained or shown in enough detail. It, therefore, doesn’t seem plausible that cities could be made mobile. The plot is immediately built on a shifty, uncertain premise, and we, as the audience, don’t feel secure in the world we are entering. World building in a fantasy film is essential to its success. How can you allow yourself to dream if you know that you’re asleep? And the characters. They can’t seem to escape the caricature natures written into the script. Hester is a one-note, manic, alt-Disney princess who hides behind a scarf because of a measly scar on her face. Tom is a wide-eyed ingénue with only good intentions and very little self-awareness; he is also supposed to be the love interest, but there isn’t much chemistry flickering between the leads. Valentine is the fiendish villain with a sparkle of menace in his eye and an evil plot that actually, maybe wasn’t thought through all the way. Sure, the sets are cool. The story rolls hard and fast, racing towards a final battle that you see coming from across the flatlands, but in the end, it feels like a long road trip to nowhere with people you don’t particularly like."
"Jul 14, 2020",negative,"Once we dive into the players and the events that have shaped them, Mortal Engines is undeniably derivative of countless Hero's Journey-based stories and hopelessly lacking in creative energy."
"Jul 13, 2020",negative," Dystopian YA novel adaptations seem to be a trend that will not go away, The Hunger Games set a precedent that most fail to live up to and as each year passes the imagination disintegrates into dust. The latest that falls into that category comes from the Lord of the Ring’s Peter Jackson and first time director Christian Rivers who produce a derivative paint by numbers affair with a transparent twist. Set approximately 3000 years from now, the world has been scorched of cities as we know them in a 60-minute war. The Mad Max type landscape is roamed by cities on tractor like bases, some are tiny and insignificant whiles others are tremendously large, bellowing and boisterous monstrosities that swallow the smaller ones whole for fuel and ancient parts.  ‘London’ is one in particular, with landmarks such as St Paul’s Cathedral dome and Trafalgar Square lions scattered around its compound. This is the big daddy of Cities and no one in their right mind would come against it. The well respected Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) is at the helm of this city, on the surface he appears to be an honourable man but as Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) boards the city and subsequently attacks him it’s obvious he isn’t as snow white as he would like to portray. No sooner is Hester on board; she quickly gets kicked off with Museum apprentice Tom (Robert Sheehan) and we are soon on a quest to get back to ‘London’ so Hester can finish the job before weapons of the past can be rebuilt to destroy the world as they know it. The major problem here is the fact we have all seen this before, there is nothing original or imaginative to set this out and in parts can be seen as a homage to the likes of Star Wars. Throw in Hester’s backstory and a resistance group lead by Anna Fang (Jihae) and we have that age-old dystopian battle to save the world and save the oppressed. The beat of the plot steam punk’s its way to its predictable ending (which you’ll easily call from the very first scene) with visually exciting tenacity. The attention to detail to the dark and grimy depths of the core of ‘London’s inner sanctum are beyond doubt an impressive feat but at times it confuses itself. Does it want to be serious or funny? Neither hit with any real connection, the jokes fall flat and even the funniest moment when the Minions are referred to as American Deities’ raises a few titters isn’t quite factually correct. The performances are bog standard, Hilmar gives as good as she gets as an ass-kicking and determined heroine but Sheehan doesn’t really have much to work with. Thrown in as a side-kick that could be a love interest, he really doesn’t have much to do but follow Hilmar’s Hester around like an annoying little puppy. These Engines have had a false start and broken the fan belt, thank god they are mortal because this one dies a very slow death."
"May 20, 2020",negative,A missed opportunity.
"May 20, 2020",negative,It wasn't fun or good or interesting.
"Apr 4, 2020",negative," About ten minutes into Mortal Engines, I became convinced I would never find out what a mortal engine actually is. Is it the giant behemoth city that is London on wheels? Or maybe it’s the centipede like vehicle that rambles across the wasteland with ease? Or, could it be the steampunk planes that defy gravity? Or, possibly it’s robot Dad who has green eyes that pierce through the night? If there’s one thing for sure, there won’t be a second Mortal Engines film to give an explanation. Maybe that’s what a mortal engine is? The behemoth that is Hollywood endlessly creating bloated CGI-filled flicks that cost more than a small country makes in a year, all the while they’re destined to fail at the box office. Eventually, once the template of The Producers has failed one too many times, these mammoth production houses have no choice but to dissolve into nothing, leaving a field of producers standing alone scratching their heads with no idea how this ever could have happened.  Sure, this film does contain the best post credits scene of all time (as in, the film simply cuts to a black screen, oh? That wasn’t a post credits scene and instead was just the sweet mercy grip that this whole thing was finally over? Well then…), but even though there are apparently three more books in the series,there is simply no way that there will ever be a continuation of this series. Apparently the books are popular young adult fare, which given the content, I can easily believe that.  Now, damning this film with the faintest of praise for a brief moment, I will say that Mortal Engines is one of those eighties films (like The Goonies) that you fell in love with as a kid, and then you rewatch it as an adult and realise it was all bunkum trash. It’s a childish kind of good, but I fear that kids nowadays are a little bit wiser than we were in the eighties and wouldn’t stand for such mediocre material. Well, even though Conan O’Brien once said, ‘don’t be cynical’, it’s bloody well hard not to approach this tepid affair with a heavy dose of cynicism. There’s so little to hold onto with this film.  Plot? Oh, yeah, you probably want to know about the plot.Well, there’s a girl with a scarf over her face because she’s got a scar. Fear not BFI, she’s the hero of the piece so, y’know, positive representation and all that. Her name is Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar). If you forget this, the film will remind you every thirty seconds as supporting characters are endlessly shouting out her name, HESTER SHAW!, even though as a ‘main character’ she’s surprisingly devoid of any kind of agency.  Instead, the guy driving the plot is Han Solo Mark 9, this time played by Robert Sheehan. Sheehan has been in films before, I know this because I quite liked him in Three Summers, but his casting here feels like it happened simply because he was in a film called The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. Good on you Rob. Alas, there’s little to suggest that he’s going to go on to do bigger, brighter, better things in this flick.  Hugo Weaving appears because New Zealand isn’t very far from Australia and Peter Jackson has his phone number on speed dial. He’s Hugo Weaving. The biggest crime of Weaving’s casting is that the film never allows him to chew on the dialogue it throws at him. Heck, when Weaving’s villain calls someone a dinosaur, and then remarks that he’s ‘the meteor’, the film presents this solid line with all the impact of a wet paper towel. Soppy and annoying.  Then, there’s Stephen Lang as CGI robot Dad, Shrike. He’s a robot. And he’s Hester Shaw’s surrogate Dad. For reasons, he is real mad at her and now stalks the world searching for her. The character design is admittedly quite impressive, but it’s impossible to shake the feeling that Shrike walked out of a Pirates of the Caribbean film into this one by mistake. No doubt the character has some kind of emotional resonance in the books, but here it’s just another subplot that makes no sense and goes nowhere. Which is the best way to explain Mortal Engines. It’s nonsensical pap that would have been better serviced under the title Steampunk and the World of Tomorrow. It wants to make some kind of fun at the way we’re obsessed with technology, but in a film fuelled by said technology, well, it carries no weight. And, on top of this, for a film that’s released by Universal, it’s exceptionally poor of them to include a joke about how Minions are deities that we are obsessed with. Ho ho, funny stuff there guys.  Look, there’s no reason to see Mortal Engines. It’s not ‘so bad it’s good’. There’s no one set piece that is overly impressive – unless, that is, you’re easily impressed by CGI noise, then by all means, giants cities on wheels eating smaller cities might be interesting enough. The endless swooping camera movements, the overly dramatic music, the inconsequential characters, and the nonsensical plot leave you with an empty feeling. This is the sort of film that has people commenting about they could never ever spill a secret they’re sworn to keep, and then in the same breath tell that secret to a stranger. It’s the sort of film that has flashbacks to something that happened five minutes ago. It’s a film that should have you asking, how the heck did this get made?

"Aug 29, 2019",negative," Director Christian Rivers' new “Mortal Engines” film answers that question with a clear, grinding, belching, ""no!"" The bloated Hollywood machine can't oppose capitalism — though it can, via great metal jaws, eat anti-capitalism for breakfast. The 2001 novel “Mortal Engines” by Philip Reeve, on which the movie is based, is a bleak meditation on capitalism and imperialism disguised as an imaginative steampunk goof. The book (and film) are set in a distant, post-apocalyptic future, in which cities have become mobile. Metropolises roam the barren land, chasing down and ingesting smaller cities for their raw materials. The large and strong prey on the small and weak, in accordance with the principles of Municipal Darwinism — a term that winks at the rapacious, 19th-century philosophy of Social Darwinism. The only morality, according to Municipal Darwinism, is consume or be consumed, which is, Reeves suggests, a familiar mantra for the present day. The best part of “Mortal Engines” the movie, and the part of the film that is truest to the book, are the visuals. ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson, who developed the project, is much celebrated for his baroque aesthetic. That makes him a perfect fit for a grimy, retro-future nightmare. The opening sequence, in which a giant mobile London chases down and devours a small Bavarian mining town, is a masterpiece of hyperbolic Hollywood magic. The film's look touches on Terry Gilliam and the early “Star Wars” films, but unfolds into uniquely gritty absurdity. The movie brings to life Reeve's world, in which the early industrial age never ended, and the future is an extended Dickensian nightmare, with monstrous Gradgrind's chasing each other joylessly around a barren earth. When you look closer at the grit, though, you start to see the telltale Hollywood polish underneath. The most obvious example involves the main heroine. In the book, Hester Shaw has ""a terrible scar [that] ran down her face from forehead to jaw, making it look like a portrait that had been furiously crossed out."" Her mouth is twisted, her nose is ""a smashed stump"" and one of her eyes is destroyed. Yet in the movie, Shaw (Hera Hilmar) is barely disfigured. She has a minor scar off to the side, which if anything accentuates her leading lady perfection. The rest of the movie assiduously tidies up the novel's other scars as well. The complicated plot is streamlined into a “Star Wars” riff, complete with Death Star weapon and ""I am your father"" climax. Several of the major character deaths — which give the book a ruthless, Darwinian bite — are abandoned for a more standard, happily ever after ending. In the book, the villain, Thaddeus Valentine (played by Hugo Weaving in the movie) is a weak man, who is evil because he compromises with an evil system in part out of love for his daughter. In the film, however, he's a standard-issue, power-hungry megalomaniac. More subtly, but more tellingly, the film's adventure plot simply rolls over the main thematic content of the book. Mobile London, in the novel, is a wonderful mechanism. But it's powered by suffering. Katherine Valentine (Leila George), Thaddeus' privileged daughter, learns with horror that her comfort is made possible by a throng of workers in the bowels of the city, called the Gut. In the novel's most stomach-churning scene, Katherine watches prison slave laborers wading in raw sewage, which they are being forced to turn into experimental food. They are given no other sustenance themselves. ""Unfortunately they keep dying,"" a supervisor muses. ""But that is just a temporary setback, I am sure."" In “Mortal Engines” the novel, the interior of capitalism is a hellscape of death and despair. That's what gives the narrative its moral force. The rebel group, known as anti-tractionists, wants to overthrow the city-eat-city regime of Municipal Darwinism. They are motivated by the desire to end a social order of terrible cruelty and exploitation. Katherine eventually turns against her father and her city in the book because she comes to understand the brutality which powers both. In the film, though, class politics barely exist. The evil the heroes fight onscreen is not a brutal, entrenched status quo. Instead, the problem is one bad apple revolutionary. Valentine is fixated on developing new and dangerous weapons. In the book, he develops those weapons despite the objections of the city's ruler. In the movie, he's following the ruler's plan. So a parable about the cruelty of the society we live in, and the need to change it, becomes another story about how ambitious rebels ruin everything when they buck tradition. The war Valentine starts is presented in the film as a break with Municipal Darwinism — a dangerous, innovative rupture in the capitalist system. In the novel, in contrast, escalating violence is the logical outgrowth of a hunger for resources, inanimate and human. Valentine is evil in the film because he insists on transforming the machine. In the book, he's evil because he's a cog. “Mortal Engines” the film loves cogs and it loves capitalism. From Reeve's words, the filmmakers have built a machine that revels in the authenticity and imaginative impact of photogenic grime and squalor. Capitalism in the film is an ugly-beautiful painting — a grandiose spectacle of power. The wheels revolve, the bellows blow, the jaws crunch in surround sound. It's a terrible, wonderful Hollywood machine. If someone, somewhere, is suffering for it in some noxious gut, you won't hear them over the audience's ""oohs"" and ""ahs."""
"Jun 5, 2019",positive," With a book series already published and Peter Jackson’s writing team on board to convert, Mortal Engines ticks the boxes for any film studio looking for a money-making franchise with a pre-existing fanbase. Still, even with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens converting, and Jackson protege Christian Rivers directing (he worked on storyboards across all of Jackson’s movies), Mortal Engines is a movie with a great deal of promise, but finds itself running out of gas before the credits roll. Society as we know it has long collapsed and transformed into what is described as ‘Municipal Darwinism’. The ’60 Minute War’ destroyed much of the world, and the survivors grouped together to form ‘predator cities’, cities that no longer sit-in one place, rather, they have been converted into giant, roaming fortresses that rumble around the country looking for smaller societies to claim as their own. Led by the Lord Mayor Crone (Game of Thrones’s Patrick Malahide), London has, somewhat ironically, left the British shores and headed across to mainland Europe, looking for smaller cities to swallow up. The next city in its sights happens to have a young lady called Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) in its population, which is good for her – for Hester intends to assassinate Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), the head of London’s Historians. For as nice as Valentine seems to be, he’s got a dark past, and it has something to do with his desire to get his hands on the very weapons that led to society’s collapse. After a failed attempt at Valentine’s life, Hester finds herself on a road journey across the desolate wastelands of ‘the Great Hunting Ground’, with junior London historian, Tom (Robert Sheehan) in tow, in one of those unlikely couple scenarios where the couple are actually very likely. Looking like a cross between Howl’s Moving Castle and the video game Bioshock, Mortal Engines takes us into a rich world with a dense backstory. It absolutely makes sense for a movie franchise, and yet despite having a talented writing team with Lord of the Rings experience, it’s in the book-to-movie conversion where things have gone awry. The pacing is all over the place with characters disappearing for great stretches of running time, and the one subplot that has the most heart – involving a terminator-like robot called Shrike – is frustratingly under-developed. With so much backstory to get across, the film contains more exposition than a Christopher Nolan triple bill. That’s understandable, but still a little heavy-handed. And then there’s the tone – at times it feels like the movie aimed at pre-teens (particularly Sheehan’s performance as Tom), but the scale of the violence and destruction – and the menace of Shrike – is far more suitable for a post-teen audience. For the first two thirds of the movie there’s much to be happy about, it looks glorious and the mystery unfolds intriguingly. But the goodwill it picks up along the way is blown when the final act devolves into city-destroying action scenes with a villain who could have been layered – and perhaps even justifiably motivated – becoming little more than a cliched megalomaniac. It’s certainly not a disaster, but with plotting as bad as this it’s hard to imagine Mortal Engines getting a boost at the box office."
"May 24, 2019",positive," THE UNPOPULAR OPINION is an ongoing column featuring different takes on films that either the writer HATED, but that the majority of film fans LOVED, or that the writer LOVED, but that most others LOATHED. We're hoping this column will promote constructive and geek fueled discussion. Enjoy! Isn't it amazing how two movies with virtually the exact same plot can have such wildly different receptions? Take ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL and MORTAL ENGINES: both films are set in dystopian futures and concern young women seeking retribution for harm brought to them while demonstrating a strength lacking in the face of totalitarian oppression. Both feature stunning special effects and a wholly realized and unique vision of the future. Both films also have acclaimed producers known for their own special effects-laden epic blockbusters and a cast of relative unknowns with familiar supporting players. Both come from source material that have cult followings and both are crammed with enough world-building for multiple movies forced into a two hour run time. While neither film has lit up the box office, the fan reception for ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL has been overwhelming while MORTAL ENGINES sputtered the moment it debuted late in 2018. As much as I enjoyed ALITA, I was shocked to discover that I enjoyed MORTAL ENGINES just as much and feel it deserves a much larger audience. The plot of MORTAL ENGINES is stupid. I say that as endearingly as I possibly can because all genre plots are pretty flimsy. From STAR WARS to AVATAR, the over-the-top characters and settings of science fiction and fantasy films require a great deal of suspension of disbelief for them to work. You have to go into MORTAL ENGINES with that suspension cranked to the maximum because this is a story about gigantic rolling cities. A steampunk wet dream, there is little logical reason for these cities to move the way they do, but the broad strokes of good versus evil, rich versus poor, strength versus faith, and love conquers all come through loud and clear. MORTAL ENGINES borrows heavily from George Lucas' saga as well as LORD OF THE RINGS, MAD MAX, and countless other similar franchises over the years. The difference is that MORTAL ENGINES has it's tongue firmly in cheek for the entire film. MORTAL ENGINES feels very much like a Peter Jackson film. Scripted by Jackson alongside frequent collaboraters Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh, there are numerous moments throughout the film that recall Jackson's earlier works like DEAD-ALIVE and MEET THE FEEBLES. There is a humor and a New Zealand sensibility to the entire production which distances it from other Hollywood tentpoles. Every character references the ancient world of the early 21st century with a nod and a wink, giving us plenty of inside jokes about our technology and culture and how foreign it appears to the citizens of this fictional land. But rather than come across as groan-worthy, it connects the viewer to this dense mythology and provides a connection point between 2019 and the landscape of MORTAL ENGINES. What also sets this movie apart from other fantasy epics is the lead. So often, the hero is someone like Rey, Katniss Everdeen or Luke Skywalker who embark on a hero's journey to reach their full potential. With MORTAL ENGINES, Hester Shaw is already mid-journey and we accompany her with Tom Natsworthy serving as our entry into the narrative. Tom, played by The Umbrella Academy's Robert Sheehan, is not the stirring protagonist you would expect. At the same time, Hera Hilmar gives one heck of a leading performance and gives us a heroine who is already well on her way to her destiny. Couple that with Hugo Weaving who is always a solid villain and you have most of the legwork done for you. Combine all of these elements and you have a story that has a lot of work to do in a short amount of time. Luckily, Jackson is used to telling big tales in the confines of a feature film. World-building has earned some negative connotations in recent years as many erroneously use it as a synonym for franchising. World-building requires laying the foundation for a massive fictional realm and often goes hand in hand with designing an ongoing franchise. While it is highly unlikely we will ever get a sequel to MORTAL ENGINES, it is a shame because it was such an amazing attempt. The diverse cast of characters and unique realms that populate this story could have fed multiple movies. In fact, I want to see prequels chronicling the adventures of Anna Fang (Jihae). Fang is a bit of a wasted character here, meeting her demise far too early, but shows that even the supporting players in this movie have enough standout qualities to warrant further investment. So much of MORTAL ENGINES reminded me of a teen-appropriate MAD MAX that it is fair to call this FURY ROAD LITE and I mean that as a compliment. The action and storyline here are worthy of George Miller's franchise and should have been just as lauded. First time director Christian Rivers, whose experience working with Peter Jackson dates all the way back to DEAD-ALIVE, makes few missteps with MORTAL ENGINES, likely because his mentor was close by and helped him get his footing as a filmmaker. The resulting film feels very much like if Terry Gilliam had directed CLOUD ATLAS and that is high praise. Some may say that top caliber special effects are not enough to buouy a film, but MORTAL ENGINES also benefits from a brilliant score by Junkie XL and excellent editing by Jonno Woodford-Robinson. The vibrant colors of the movie pop off the screen giving this movie far more life and energy than Jackson gave to any of the three films in THE HOBBIT trilogy. MORTAL ENGINES is a silly concept told with the highest caliber of filmmaking. There is a lot of familiarity in the characters and story, but the sheer creativity visually on display sets this movie apart. At the same time, that we see so many other movies when we watch MORTAL ENGINES should be treated more as homage than as derivative. MORTAL ENGINES is a lot to take in and the unfamiliarity most viewers have with the source material begs repeated viewings to try and process everything on screen. I already have found myself wanting to revisit this movie more than THE HOBBIT and that is a testament to both Christian Rivers and Peter Jackson. It is rare that we get such a starkly distinct movie in wide release which makes it a shame that so few gave this movie a chance. But, I beg you to watch it if you can and I think you will enjoy it as much as you did ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL.

 We have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 Years Later, a trilogy of sequels to Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later. The Fall Guy just hit CinemaCon for a victory lap after premiering at SXSW. Does it live up to the hype and give Ryan Gosling a clasic role?"
"May 4, 2019",neutral," As much as Peter Jackson‘s name is plastered all over this, Mortal Engines is in fact NOT a Jackson joint. Yes, the Lord of the Rings helmer is the most likely reason this film was greenlit (he serves as both co-producer and co-writer) but long-time Jackson collaborator Christian Rivers, who served predominantly as a visual effects supervisor on the majority of Jackson’s filmography, is behind the camera here – on debut no less – so perhaps it’s time credit is paid where it’s due. That gripe out of the way, Mortal Engines, as loud and as ambitious as it is, is not the start of another YA-aimed franchise – as much as it clearly hopes to be. Rivers showcases visual flare behind the lens, and the effects and scope of the film are where it is most successful, but special effects do not a good movie make, and Mortal Engines sadly suffers from an ensemble cast who fail to elevate the stereotypical material above expectation. A Morgan Freeman-esque voice-over informs us at the front-end of the film that we are thousands of years in the future, and civilisation essentially wrecked themselves with a war that resulted in cities now being constructed as giant wheeled contraptions that roam a post-apocalyptic landscape searching for whatever resources are still lying around; apparently in this future cracked iPhones and brand-name toasters are seen as scrap gold. The city that gets the most traction is London, now an oversized steam-powered roller that’s joined together with its own self-contained rail system and uneven streets. Due to the importance of history, and his own knowledge of it, the obviously-villainous Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) has soared through the ranks to become the city’s unofficial leader. Opposing our scene-chewing Valentine and his roaring city is the mysterious Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar, sadly not possessing the type of charisma one needs to lead a film, let alone a franchise), a scarred and resentful orphan whose own backstory gives her all the reasons we expect as to why she’s so hellbent on taking Valentine down. The story itself is far from being overtly original, and the majority of the cast all seem rather untested in the ways of a big budget epic (Weaving is at least having fun, and South Korean musician Jihae makes something of an impression as a well-tailored resistance leader, but Hilmar and “love interest” Robert Sheehan are too bland to sustain interest) but I imagine those ingredients will be overlooked, and therefore forgiven, for the film’s admittedly impressive visual structure. There’s a wealth of design on hand, and both Rivers and Jackson deserve their credit in painting a familiar landscape with a fresh brush. Whilst I suspect younger audiences will perhaps lap up Mortal Engines, the majority of theatre goers are likely to view this with a sense of deja vu. A sprawling civilisation overseen by a tyrant roaming a wasteland whilst two opposites find love?  I guess “Mad Max’s Hunger Games of Star Wars” was too long a title! Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Mar 20, 2019",positive," If I have to hear one more person ask me, “Did you read the books?” in response to me saying I liked Mortal Engines, I’m never going to stop screaming. Why would I have read these books? Aren’t they written for 12-year-olds? Am I supposed to just blindly start reading young adult adventure fiction because to do so has recently moved me a few points over on the adult acceptability meter? To hell with that. I just want movies. And I know I’m going to get some static from certain people for saying this, but this is actually one of my favorite movies of the year. Not one of the best, not by a long shot, but absolutely one of the best times I had in a theater. Mortal Engines is essentially a nonstop movie-quoting machine, and I mean that in the best possible sense. Its references come fast and often, remixing tropes, characters, plots, dialogue and even set designs from just about every modern sci-fi and postapocalyptic story of the last few decades, even moving beyond that scope to encompass enough other pieces of film history to make the case that the filmmakers are definitely onto something. It’s the Girl Talk (the artist, not the game) of movies. Whereas this year’s pitiful Ready Player One threw all of its inspirations and Easter eggs onto the screen and expected that the simple notion of recognizability was enough to stand in for having a plot or a point, Mortal Engines revels in its countless points of origin and turns them into something truly original. And it does it all while allowing its obscure-to-the-point-of-impenetrable world-building to simply be, tossing in hints as to what it all really means while playing it cool and admitting that, eh, it’s actually not even all that important. This is what life is like a thousand years in the future. Weird doesn’t even begin to describe it. There are the standard script problems inherent to even the best of the genre, but even those are buried under the sheer colossal weight of what’s on screen. I barely think I could handle watching something like this in 3-D. And the film’s most glaring fault is trying to make me believe anyone, no matter what century they’re living in, could look at Hugo Weaving and not guess that he’s probably the most evil person in any given room. Mortal Engines plays almost like a bridge between the kid-friendly and more adult-focused works of Terry Gilliam, the Wachowskis, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Hayao Miyazaki. It steals from the greats and gets away with it because it wants you to notice and it wants you to care. And like all great acts of cinematic theft, it works whether you actually notice all that or not. There are cloud cities, robot zombies, evil governments, ancient societies, steampunk architecture, even a quick and bizarre cameo from those hideous yellow Temazepam demons, The Minions. As I said: weird. Having been unceremoniously dumped right into Spider-Man and Aquaman season, the movie will come and go quickly. I have no idea what a fan of the book might think of the film, but as a movie fan, it’s the best and most surprising early Christmas present I could have hoped for.

"Mar 5, 2019",negative,it's sorta the young adult version of The Road Warrior and Mad Max. A world full of crazy engines and and stories and cities that are moving around. It feels very derivative.
"Mar 2, 2019",negative," THE trailers, and the fact that The Lord of The Rings’ Peter Jackson is the producer behind this film set in a post-apocalyptic world, intrigued me. The story is set in a world that has been destroyed by ‘the ancients’ (that is, us) and what is left are giant mobile mechanical cities that travel from place to place to find food and other resources to keep them running. When one of the smaller mobile cities gets swallowed up by the gigantic mobile city called London, its inhabitants are forced to go through a tight security checkpoint as their former home is stripped for valuable ‘old world’ technology that London needs. Hester accuses Thaddeus of killing her mother, but before she can deliver the fatal blow, she is stopped by Tom (Robert Sheehan), a young man who works in a museum. Hester escapes, Tom gives chase, and when he catches her before she can fall off a platform, she tells him the truth about Thaddeus. She breaks free from Tom’s grip and falls to the ground below. When Tom tells Thaddeus what Hester has told him, Thaddeus pushes him off the platform. Tom survives the fall and tags along with Hester trying to find a way back. The duo gets into some trouble but are rescued by Anna Fang (Jihae), the leader of a resistance group who are trying to put a stop to the moving cities. Filling up the rest of the story is the revelation of Hester’s past and Thaddeus’ true motivations. Viewers familiar with the current political climate might get the references to Britain’s Brexit saga, and US President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration stance. Those who don’t will just not care."
"Feb 20, 2019",negative," With Peter Jackson serving as executive producer, Mortal Engines should feel like more of an event — one with beautifully realized visual effects and the sort of high-fantasy spectacle we’ve come to expect from the filmmaker behind The Lord of the Rings. But the dystopian YA adaptation (a description that has become redundant) is hitting theaters with a whisper. Fitting, given its lackluster action sequences and a tepid (and predictable) story which reads like a steampunk retread of Star Wars by way of Final Fantasy.  It doesn’t help that Mortal Engines – based on the YA book series by Philip Reeve – is going up against highly anticipated holiday blockbusters like Mary Poppins Returns and Aquaman… unless that release tactic was meant to reflect the film’s basic plot about a scrappy underdog going up against a massive bureaucracy that has become a literal machine (it wasn’t). The film, from director Christian Rivers, takes place hundreds of years in the future, after a cataclysmic event has destroyed the world as we know it. Cities have become motorized behemoths on wheels and giant airships; some people have chosen to live in “static” cities on the ground. London is a massive tank that consumes other, smaller and poorer cities, salvaging its artifacts and consuming its metal for fuel under orders from an aging dictator-type. The residents of London cheer these violent consumerist acts. All of the metaphors are exceedingly literal, but this is a movie for… well, it’s allegedly for young people and fans of the book series, but it feels more like a movie produced by the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter section of Hot Topic.  The main cast of characters includes Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), a young woman fighting the resistance against London and seeking revenge for the murder of her mother at the hands of Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) – a villain whose exact role in London, beyond being cartoonishly evil, is unclear. (Wikipedia says he’s the head of the Guild of Historians, which houses such artifacts as Sunbeam toasters, iPhones, and statues of Minions because this is a Universal film and that IP is free.) Our young male hero is Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), a historian who once dreamt of becoming an aviator (which predictably pays off during the climax). Tom reluctantly joins forces with Hester and Anna Fang (South Korean star Jihae), the fugitive leader of the “Anti-Traction League” – a resistance group fighting against cities like London, which seek only to destroy and consume. There’s also a giant robotic creature called Shrike (Stephen Lang), who was once a human man and is now a soulless hunk of metal that curiously resembles Nick Valentine from the Fallout games – a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Hester is essentially the Luke Skywalker of the film, and although Tom has some piloting experience, his encyclopedic knowledge and constant chatter basically makes him the C-3PO in this scenario. Anna Fang is the Han Solo here with her awesome old school RPG-esque airship and unlimited swagger. She is the young Han Solo we truly deserve. Mortal Engines culminates in a largely air-based battle resembling the sequence in which Luke Skywalker leads a squadron of fighter-pilots to infiltrate the Death Star. Without spoiling anything, a third-act reveal is almost identical to a major plot point in the Star Wars universe. And yet, Mortal Engines lacks the entertainment value found in even the lowliest of Star Wars movies – the prequels. I’d happily trade the bland Robert Sheehan for a hopping Yoda in a heartbeat.  While the design of the massive, rolling cities is certainly novel and intriguing, the action sequences leave quite a bit to be desired. It’s the sort of inelegant, poorly edited mish-mash of digital nonsense that makes your eyes glaze over. The mind wanders to more interesting topics like, “I wonder what my cat is doing right now” just to keep your brain active. Don’t worry, by the time your attention returns to the film at hand, you won’t have missed anything – and even if you did, the dialogue is consistently expository.  Perhaps if Universal released Mortal Engines in the doldrums of January or February, it might have arrived with more than a whimper – not quite a bang, but maybe a thump at the very least. One might assume that Jackson’s involvement as executive producer (and co-writer, with frequent collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) would elicit more interest and yield a higher quality of product, especially given that the popularity of the Mortal Engines book series pales in comparison to that of the Wizarding Worlds and Hobbit Holes and such. But maybe this is the level of quality that Jackson & Co. thought fitting for the source material; perhaps they were operating one of those “donate what you feel is appropriate” models. If that’s the case, then they certainly achieved what they set out to do – the bare minimum."
"Feb 7, 2019",negative,A botch more concerned with creating a would-be franchise than in making a movie entertaining enough to make audiences want to see more.
"Feb 4, 2019",positive," Moments of truly spectacular big-budget filmmaking is undercut  by personality void performances and ho-hum storytelling, making Mortal Engines a film that knows how to  rev its engines but doesn’t have enough gas to fulfil its franchise potential. The Lord of the Rings trilogy indeed  was masterful filmmaking. The story, the stunning New Zealand location, the  battle scenes…all of this and much more woven together to create a tapestry of  cinematic greatness worthy of all praise and awards. What many often overlook  is the casting, an assemblage of character actors from various corners of the globe  that took on their iconic characters created by J.R.R Tolkien and made them  their own. Mortal Engines,  the latest big-budget epic from the LOTR trio Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh  and Philippa Boyens, fails to capitalise on that fact. Directed by Christian Rivers, Mortal Engines is based on  the first of four young adult adventure fantasy novels that takes place in a  post-apocalyptic world (sigh), where cities are now monstrous vehicles that rove  the long barren terrains of Earth. The biggest and prosperous of these is  London, where chief engineer Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) seeks even  greater conquests no matter the consequence. Standing in his way is Hester Shaw  (Hera Hilmar) a mysterious figure from this past who seeks revenge.  With a budget of $100 million, there is no denying that Mortal Engines aims to overwhelm with  its larger than life visuals and impressive world building. Yet it doesn’t take  much to find that under its veneer there are many problems to this would be  saga, namely a dire absence of character and stakes to differentiate this Mad-Max for millennials from any other YA nonsense that came before it. The casting of  personality bereft leads in Hera Hilmar and Robert Sheehan does not help in  engrossing its audience into its world and in its inhabitants. If there was  ever a potential franchise that needed a shot of star power, this would be it. What is impressive with Mortal Engines is its ability to have the audience say “wow!”  during key moments of big scale action brilliance. Rivers (who was an art  director on The Hobbit) clearly has learned a thing or two from Jackson on  how to work on a large landscape. It’s just a shame that the smaller things  that make a big picture epic did not get the same love."
"Jan 15, 2019",positive," Peter Jackson chose not to direct the spectacular post-apocalyptic “Mortal Engines.” But he wrote the screenplay adaptation with longtime screenwriting partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyen. And he closely supervised every aspect of this grandiose sci-fi riff that’s set a thousand years from now. “Engines” begins with a riveting chase as London, a “predator city” on gigantic treads and wheels, pursues a small city that it intends to literally devour. Cities in this landscape are on the move. A towering ramshackle compact of neighborhoods, parks and libraries, stacked with weapons, buildings, boiler rooms and hordes of people, these edifices roam desolate, barren landscapes like great harvesting combines in search of fuel and food. From the start, “Mortal Engines,” adapted from Philip Reeve’s book, is so immensely ambitious in its startling size and scale, invention and details, it suggests that in the wake of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises, Jackson can do — and spend — anything he wants. If only that had been matched by the lackluster, too predictable scenario. Jackson and first-time director Christian Rivers (an Oscar winner for visual effects on Jackson’s “King Kong”) have a youthful, photogenic quartet to lead this adventure’s twisty path of thwarting world domination. That’s the dream of the dastardly, deceitful, murderous Thaddeus Valentine, a despot whose name must be a joke — this killer has no heart. Played with a gleeful sneer by Aussie Hugo Weaving (“The Matrix”), Valentine is about a subtle as a blowtorch. Only his smart, beautiful but unaware daughter Katherine (Leila George; her actor parents are Vincent D’Onofrio of “Full Metal Jacket” and Greta Scacchi, recently seen in “Operation Finale”) is naive enough to trust this duplicitous schemer. As “Mortal” kicks its storytelling gear into drive, Thaddeus survives vengeance-driven Hester Shaw’s (Iceland’s Hera Hilmar) assassination attempt. Hester escapes, aided by Tom (Ireland’s Robert Sheehan), the film’s swashbuckling co-star. Eventually Katherine bonds with Belvis Pod (Dublin’s Ronan Raferty) against dad. An unseen Stephen Lang is the voice of Shrike, a “resurrected man,” meaning an android who, like Thaddeus, has a complicated past that intersects with Hester."
"Jan 14, 2019",negative," ¿A ustedes no les sucede lo mismo? Es que me llama la atención ese cine cuya trama parte de la destrucción del mundo (casi siempre por guerras nucleares) y que, de pronto, aparecen sobrevivientes por aquí y por allá, todos con costumbres distintas y armas extrañas. La cuestión es que, a pesar de lo apocalíptico de los sucesos, del cataclismo, las guerras siguen siendo “necesarias”: es parte del pesimismo inevitable del llamado género fantástico en el cine y en la literatura, y por ahí van y vienen las tramas. Dentro de esa onda, se exhibe ahora la película neozelandesa Máquinas mortales (2018), dirigida por Christian Rivers, pero con la producción de la mano conocida de Peter Jackson y de su equipo, quienes se embelesan cada vez más con grandes producciones de escandalosos arrebatos visuales y sonoros. Máquinas mortales lo viene a ratificar. Argumento: después del fin de la civilización humana (si es que la ha habido alguna vez), las ciudades son enormes máquinas rodantes, donde las más poderosas se comen a las más pequeñas, como aquello de que pez grande se come al más chico. No es solo la guerra lo que aparece de nuevo. Hasta el esclavismo se renueva y, sobre todo, el ansia de poder, aunque sea sobre ruinas. En este filme, lo demás son aventuras con gran intensidad y algún melodrama por ahí metido, según la literatura para adolescentes que le da base a este filme: la del británico Philip Reeve. Pese a su aparatosa parafernalia, esta película resulta unidimensional se le mire por donde se le mire (peor en el concepto de los personajes y, ergo, en las malas actuaciones). Mantiene la ya cansada mirada distópica sin riqueza conceptual, como si todo sucediese al azar. Con su transcurso, el filme muestra la contradicción entre tecnología con el bajo nivel de vida de sectores oprimidos. Es una lucha de clases con rasgo cyberpunk. Eso sí, ese apunte sociológico, casi marxista, salva al filme del desastre. Igual se da la presencia del anacronismo visual, aunque embrollado: influencia de un steampunk mal manejado. Me sorprendió cómo esta película deja personajes sueltos que, al largo rato, aparecen por ahí sin ton ni son. La música falla del todo por insistir con sus manoseados tonos épicos, desfasados de las imágenes. En cuanto al montaje, este no puede con tantas imágenes atropelladas. Su vana pomposidad le impide a Máquinas mortales esbozar conceptos valiosos para hablar del hombre y del mundo desde lo narrativo. Era lo que Jean Paul Sartre predicaba para la literatura, pero esto le importa poco a la gran industria del entretenimiento fílmico. No es de nuestra recomendación.

"Jan 11, 2019",negative," It’s been 10 years since Peter Jackson picked up Philip Reeve’s seminal YA novel, and decided to shepherd it to the silver screen. Mortal Engines is finally rolling into cinemas, and like the mighty traction cities it depicts, the end result is cumbersome, unwieldy and belching waste. Thankfully, the one thing Jackson is best at – detailed world design – is put to good use in Mortal Engines. Each motorised metropolis is something to behold. The film walks a knife-edge between corny visual references and fascinating infrastructure porn, as the landmarks of London are reimagined on wheels – from the austere dome of St Paul’s to the ever-present Routemaster bus. These visual gags land a lot better than the vocal ones – Mortal Engines chucks in the odd political jibe about Trump and Brexit, but these throwaway lines clash with the film’s allegorical and escapist vibes. Unfortunately, while the city-vs-city square-offs are breathtaking, human fight sequences are choppy and forgettable. A large part of this is due to the characters – some of the series’ most interesting characters are distilled down to cookie-cutter cliché. Take Shrike: this fan favourite is boiled down to pirate terminator, and a perfectly-cast Stephen Lang is wasted behind inconsistent and boring CGI. And our two leads? Impressively forgettable even by the standards of the young adult film genre – we’ll see if they even get a niche Tumblr following. This numbing, wasteful approach is applied to every interesting character and theme from the book series – at least you can say that Mortal Engines is consistent. Those unfamiliar with the Mortal Engines series are advised to skip this bland and choppy offering. And book fans? We should have learned from The Hobbit. Stay clear if you like your childhood memories untarnished by Peter Jackson. SYNOPSIS: A mysterious young woman named Hester Shaw joins forces with Anna Fang, a dangerous outlaw with a bounty on her head, and Tom Natsworthy, an outcast from London, to lead a rebellion against a giant predator city on wheels. I have a dog, and sometimes I see films. I'll yell about either at any given opportunity. Say a bad word about Troy (2002) or Cockapoos, I dare you."

"Jan 10, 2019",negative," El equipo detrás de la trilogía de El Señor de los anillos se hace cargo, esta vez con el entonces diseñador visual Christian Rivers en la dirección en lugar del aquí productor y guionista Peter Jackson, de Máquinas mortales, primera parte de la saga de cuatro novelas postapocalípticas de Phillip Reeve. El universo visual creado por Rivers es ostentoso de movida cuando, casi sin explicaciones, una versión retrofuturista de la ciudad de Londres se transforma en una maquinaria infernal sobre ruedas que persigue a un pueblito pequeño para devorarlo y apropiarse de sus recursos. Esta primera secuencia auspiciosa mezcla los mundos de Mad Max, Transformers y El castillo vagabundo de Hayao Miyazaki, por más que la principal influencia de esta distopía sea el universo de Star Wars, y ya plantea una analogía interesante, y con un gran impacto visual, sobre el imperialismo. Pero la película enseguida se queda sin fuerzas y no consigue mantenerse a la altura de ese comienzo enorme. La historia tiene como heroína a la fugitiva huérfana Hester Shaw que, con la imprevista ayuda del tarambana historiador Tom y de una suerte de Han Solo femenina (interpretada por la estrella coreana Jihae), busca vengar la muerte de su madre a manos del malvado capitán de Londres Thaddeus Valentine. El villano (Hugo Weaving, que parece inspirarse una vez más en el papel del Agente Smith de Matrix) manda a matar a la joven protagonista usando de sicario al robot resucitado que la había críado a ella tras la muerte de la madre, para no perder tiempo mientras construye un arma nuclear dentro de la emblemática catedral de St. Paul. La revelación de lazos familiares previsibles y de algún romance tardío no alcanzan a condimentar una narración sosa. El gran problema de Máquinas mortales es la pomposidad permanente, en cada diálogo, en cada secuencia de acción (¡para qué tantas persecuciones!) y en cada una de sus alegorías que cruzan ciencia, religión y política. Esa falta de sentido del humor mantiene a la película en una galaxia muy lejana del universo lúdico de Star Wars, que se imita al punto de que toda la secuencia final parece estar más cerca del plagio que del homenaje. Máquinas mortales se permite apenas un par de chistes y los dos parecen robados de algún episodio de Futurama: un chispazo burlón sobre el consumo cultural de nuestros tiempos (¡la devoción por los Minions!) y otro un poco más ácido sobre los hábitos alimenticios actuales. Rivers demuestra en su debut como director una capacidad sobrehumana para crear un universo visual deslumbrante, pero no se puede disfrutar demasiado un mundo donde el sentido del humor es un bien tan escaso.

"Jan 7, 2019",negative,"There's something supremely cool going on here, and at times you can catch sight of it. But not often enough to make up for what it squanders."
"Jan 4, 2019",neutral," The story: Humans live in cities on wheels because the land has been destroyed by war. Among the largest of these is London, which engulfs smaller wheeled cities for their resources. There, Tom (Robert Sheehan), a junior historian, meets Hester (Hera Hilmar), a fugitive. She has infiltrated London to kill the politician Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). Adapted from the 2001 novel of the same name by Philip Reeve.  A nautical adventure in everything but name, this movie has all the ingredients for a great pirate yarn: massive moving fortresses attack each other at a stately speed, cannons roaring; heroes clamber on rigging as captains train their spy-glasses on the horizon, looking for prey. Call this one Pirates Of The Apocalypse, because this is set on Earth thousands of years in the future. A magnificent setting, but one marred by dialogue more leaden than a cannonball and weakly constructed characters all of whom - in the best piratical fashion - feel taken from other, better films. This is a production that does not let the viewer forget that the might and majesty of Peter Jackson, maker of the Lord Of The Rings (2001 to 2003) and The Hobbit films (2012 to 2014), is behind it. He is here as producer. The director is newcomer Christian Rivers, a protege of the hit-maker who arrives here after a career as a visual artist in Jackson's WingNut Films. Hester (Icelandic actress Hilmar) and her bloodlust drive the story, with the hapless Tom (Sheehan) there mainly to react with fear, and to have plot explained to him as the story progresses. With some obvious foreshadowing and a giant helping of flashback, the stakes suddenly go from revenge to something with more global impact. The long and spectacular action sequences, taking place on land, sea and air, go some way towards dispelling the tedium of the Star Wars-lite story. The real star of the show is the set design. It is, as per Jackson, magnificent. The steampunk aesthetic has never looked so good on screen, but it is a shame that one notices it so much because the people in the foreground are so bland."
"Jan 3, 2019",negative," Mortal Engines is based on the book by Philip Reeve—the first of a quartet of stories about Hester Shaw, Tom Natsworthy, and the post-apocalyptic future in which they live. Traction cities roam the globe, giant mobile beasts that hunt and repurpose each other for parts and resources. (Just go with it.) Their “municipal Darwinism” is at odds with the Anti-Traction League, who live in what we’d call normal cities and towns—the kind that don’t roll about on giant treads or wheels, crushing everything in their path. The film’s first 24 minutes, which I first saw at New York Comic Con, build a sense of scale and momentum that’s exactly right for a movie that centers on a mobile London, massive and terrifying and full of people who seem to have all the morality of your average citizen of Panem’s Capitol; they cheer and applaud as London chases down a small mining town, sucking it into the bigger city’s maw for processing. There’s whiz-bang fun to the way the smaller city folds in on itself as it races away, and to the sweeping views of London that illustrate its sheer size and its dramatic class divides. As London chases the smaller town, Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) races to get to his job in the museum, which is full of old tech, remnants of the idiotic ancients (read: us) who destroyed the world in the Sixty-Minute War. On the smaller city, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) stares intently at London, checking her knife and waiting for her moment. I love this opening sequence; it introduces nearly everyone we need to know, from Tom and Hester and Hugo Weaving’s Thaddues Valentine to Valentine’s daughter Katherine (Leila George) and the smugy pompous Herbert Melliphant (Andrew Lees), who would like to kick Tom back to the lower levels from which he came. (Colin Salmon, perhaps better known as Oliver Queen’s stepdad in Arrow’s early seasons, has a nice little role as deliciously named museum director Chudleigh Pomeroy.) If the score works a little too hard to remind you that this is a chase! in a post-apocalyptic world! Like Mad Max: Fury Road, guys!—well, fine, I can accept that, at least while everything else is progressing so nicely. But as soon as Hester, having boarded London but failed in her quest to murder Thaddeus Valentine, slips away—and Tom follows, pushed by Valentine—the movie starts to founder. There’s a lightness, and a sense of curiosity, to that first sequence that balances Hester’s murderous intensity. Her anger drives Mortal Engines’ plot, as it should, but this isn’t a dark and gritty story, nor is it the sort of archetypal, mythic tale co-writer and co-producer Peter Jackson tells so well. It’s a more grounded story, one about hurt and revenge and the kind of men who believe that they know what’s best for the whole world. It’s got its hands dirty, but it’s also charming and clever and inventive. The moment when Pomeroy rushes to save his “American deities”—two big Minions figures—is just right: his museum is being rattled to bits by London’s pursuit of the smaller town, but inside that giant traction beast, people go about their lives, and smaller things matter to them. So it’s more than a bit jarring when the film veers entirely off course for a campy sequence involving tea-serving human traffickers and a slave auction scene in which everyone’s wearing terrible wigs and seem to have stepped off the set of some low-budget ‘80s film. The tone never quite recovers; everything after that awkward sequence is self-serious to a fault. But even as it loses its sense of humor, Mortal Engines doesn’t know how to address its own weight. To free the Shrike, a metal man (ok, fine: a knockoff Terminator voiced by Stephen Lang) with his own reasons for hunting Hester, Valentine knocks a whole prison into the ocean. Yes, he’s a monster, but the movie has no interest in the fact that he just drowned a lot of people. The same goes for the refuge of Airhaven, which plummets to the ground in a fiery wreck (of course it does; you know that’s going to happen as soon as you see the sign warning against open flame). The thing is, not everything is wrong. It’s mostly just not quite right. As aviator Anna Fang, Jihae is perfect, casually slinking across the screen as she turns up just in time to save Hester from the slave auction. (Alas, her big fight sequence is a choppy, poorly framed muddle.) Anna’s ship, the Jenny Haniver, looks like a gorgeous red steampunk dragonfly, but her dialogue is full of groaners. The script saddles her with pronouncements and mini-speeches that might work in conversation, but just sound absurd as Important Statements Trying to Pass as Character Work. (She’s not the only one burdened with such lines, but she might have the most of them.) Sheehan hits just the right tone for Tom, earnest to the point of naiveté but also smart and caring—but then, for just one example, the script makes him waste a long minute in the final battle picking out a new jacket. There’s no chemistry between him and Hester—this story takes place over mere days—but we’re still treated to scenes like the one in which a dying Shrike (why does he die at this incredibly convenient moment? No idea!) decides that Hester doesn’t want Tom to die because she loves him. It’s not as if there couldn’t be any other reason. Maybe it’s that they’re turning out to be pretty good partners; that they’ve been through hell together already and don’t want to be alone; that people generally don’t want to watch other people get murdered in front of them, let alone whilst hanging about on a giant falling air-town. But this script—co-written by Jackson and his regular writing partners, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh—too often cuts the wrong corners. It streamlines the story in ways that make sense, then still insists on keeping characters that we really don’t need. (Katherine Valentine, though I like her, is largely superfluous.) And though Hester’s facial scar is hugely toned down from the books, the script is still full of references to how ugly she is, none of which make a lick of sense given what she looks like on screen. (This disconnect is aggravated by Rivers’ infuriating comments about how audiences “need to believe that Tom and Hester fall in love”—which would apparently boggle our tiny, shallow minds were Hester as scarred on film as she is on the page.) Mortal Engines is, all told, too big and too small at once. Rivers is pretty good at the big stuff—an airborne attack on London’s spotlights and guns at the end is both heavily influenced by Star Wars and surprisingly satisfying—he can’t stick the landing on the smaller moments, whether character development or smaller-scale action. After that rich opening sequence, much of the film feels like a very expensive CGI outline that has yet to be filled in. Even the effects get wobblier, the green screens more obvious, the dialogue blander and blander. At the same time, there are visual moments that are pure inventive delight, like the buglike mobile home Hester and Tom fall into, or the variety of designs for the aviators’ ships. Every traction city we see is different, from architecture to storage to engine. Someone cared about building this world. They just forgot to build the characters of the people who live in it. Remember how The Golden Compass was a terribly disappointing movie that didn’t have to be terrible? How it was in some ways brilliantly cast (Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala forever) and how cool it was to see Dust on screen, and Lyra and Iorek—and then the whole thing just crumbled into a muddle that in no way felt like Philip Pullman’s book? While Mortal Engines’ source material is a different sort of beast, the result is the same: a movie that could’ve been good, at least. It could’ve had anything to say about Valentine’s—and by extension, London’s—insistence that everyone who doesn’t want to live like him is therefore trying to destroy him. It could’ve developed the characters of the Anti-Tractionists, who seem like the most interesting folks on screen. But instead it’s simply another mediocre adaptation that will probably never get a sequel. Molly Templeton would like to call a do-over on this whole thing, but that’s not how it works. If you would also like to moan about what could’ve been, you can find her on Twitter. “There is an art to smiling in a way that others will believe. It is always important to include the eyes; otherwise, people will know you hate them.”"

"Jan 2, 2019",negative," Peter Jackson regresa con otra adaptación cinematográfica que le tomó aproximadamente 10 años llevar a la pantalla grande. Tomando ese tiempo de dedicación y que es la mente detrás de El Señor de los Anillos esperábamos grandes cosas, pero la verdad es que Máquinas Mortales deja mucho que desear. Jackson produce y escribe la versión fílmica de Máquinas Mortales, historia que nos presenta un futuro distópico donde las naciones ya no existen como las conocemos. Ahora son ciudades puestas sobre ruedas que cazan y conquistan pueblos pequeños. En ese contexto la trama sigue a la misteriosa Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), quien está decidida a destruir Londres y a Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). Pero en su aventura deberá enfrentar varios fantasmas de su pasado mientras forma una amistad con Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan). Todos esperábamos que Jackson trajera el mismo éxito de El Señor de los Anillos con Máquinas Mortales. Sin embargo decidió ceder la silla del director a su amigo de años Christian Rivers, con quien ha trabajado desde 1992. Estamos seguros de que el director neozelandés vio algo en Rivers para encargarle la cinta; sin embargo, toda la magia y la chispa se perdió en algún punto de la producción. Máquinas Mortales comienza con una historia interesante con un futuro post apocalíptico, sociedades marginadas, ciudades sobre ruedas y una resistencia que es considerada rebelde. Prácticamente es la fusión de Mad Max con Star Wars. Para darle un plus, cuenta con efectos especiales bastante creíbles y que sorprende con un Londres convertido en una ciudad móvil steampunk parecido a El Increíble Castillo Vagabundo.
 Todo eso suena prometedor y al inicio lo es y funciona muy bien, pues la trama de Máquinas Mortales es bastante fluida en la primera mitad. Sin embargo, llega un punto en el que todo el interés que causa en el espectador se cae con subtramas incoherentes, personajes secundarios innecesarios y soluciones demasiado fáciles y rápidas. Y eso no sorprende considerando que adapta todo un libro en un metraje de dos horas. Lo peor de todo es que uno ni siquiera simpatiza con los protagonistas, pues Hera Hilma y Robert Sheehan no tienen ni tantita química en pantalla. Por separado puede que funcionen un poco mejor, pero el guión es tan predecible que sus actuaciones se sienten planas y poco creíbles. Además, aparecen tantos personajes en escena que es difícil solo enfocarse en los principales. Hugo Weaving, que interpreta al villano de Máquinas Mortales no se queda atrás, pues a pesar de ser la gran mente malvada jamás se siente como una verdadera amenaza. Y eso que el actor interpretó a Red Skull en la primera del Capitán América y al brutal Agente Smith en la saga de Matrix. Por eso no dudamos de las habilidades actorales de Weaving, pero una vez más el guión aburrido y lleno de clichés hace de las suyas. La gran pregunta es si después de todo tendremos una secuela de Máquinas Mortales, pues se basa en el primer libro de la saga de 4 tomos."

"Jan 2, 2019",negative," Visualmente, Máquinas mortales, debut en la dirección de Christian Rivers, el encargado de los story boards de los filmes de Peter Jackson desde Criaturas celestiales (1994), es lo que promete: una distopía con detalles impactantes. Sin decir agua va, de inmediato sumerge al espectador en su universo: la humanidad ha quedado al límite tras la llamada Guerra de los 60 Minutos y vive en una era de Darwinismo Municipal en la que existen ciudades depredadoras, que se mueven constantemente por el mundo a través de ruedas gigantescas buscando ciudades más pequeñas a las cuales literalmente tragarse, quedándose con su población y todo aquello que podría ser de utilidad, como, por ejemplo, la vieja tecnología. La secuencia inicial, en la que la ciudad de Londres que guía la historia devora un pueblo bávaro, muestra todo esto de forma prometedora, más considerando que Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens y el propio Jackson, responsables de los guiones de la trilogía de El señor de los anillos, hicieron la adaptación de las novelas de Philip Reeve en las que se basa la historia. Sin embargo, la promesa muy pronto se queda en eso, pues cualquier alusión sociopolítica que uno podría suponer queda sepultada tal y como las ciudades pequeñas en los engranajes de las más grandes. Y aunque finalmente eso es lo de menos cuando lo que se busca es ver algo entretenido, la película tampoco cumple por esa parte. Parece que la construcción de los sets y de la imaginería visual se llevó toda la creatividad. Y eso si es que se puede hablar de creatividad en esta película que alude claramente a muchas otras. De los vestuarios de Matrix a las ambientaciones a la Mad Max e incluso a Las aventuras del barón Munchausen o a Bandidos del tiempo, sin escapar a El increíble castillo vagabundo ni a El señor de los anillos, Máquinas mortales hace una alusión imposible de no señalar ya no digamos como homenaje sino como referencia directa de Star Wars. La trama que guía desangeladamente esta cinta es muy parecida a aquella historia de George Lucas que desde hace más de 30 años se volvió referencial. Las secuencias de acción son lo bastante rígidas como para no emocionar a nadie, las actuaciones tan planas que no causan empatía, los personajes tantos y tan huecos que es imposible saber cuál es su importancia en la historia, las subtramas como la del androide aniquilador tan estorbosas que se diluye su intención. Y por si fuera poco, hay momentos en los que no se sabe si es Tom, Anna o Hester el protagonista de la historia, y no es precisamente porque se trate de una cinta coral sino porque Rivers nunca supo centrar su eje dramático. Thaddeus termina por ser el personaje más carismático de la película y no porque esa parezca la intención del filme, sino porque Hugo Weaving es un profesional que simplemente hace lo suyo.

"Dec 28, 2018",negative," Produced by Peter Jackson, but crucially not directed by him, Mortal Engines is based on a fantasy novel by Philip Reeve and set a thousand years hence, when humanity has slowly recovered from a devastating tech war.

"Dec 27, 2018",negative,"Some parts simply felt rushed and while there were some entertaining elements, the great visuals and performances unfortunately just weren't enough to keep the entire film afloat."
"Dec 24, 2018",neutral," Imagine if New  York was completely mobile. Not “if everyone in the five boroughs (which, for those of you who have not seen Gotti, are: Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx) had mobile phones” — that’s not very hard to imagine at all. More along the lines of: What if the entire city was on wheels, roaming through some sort of post-nuclear wasteland tundra? And what if it had the ability to take a similarly moving smaller town — say, Hazard, Kentucky, or maybe Monrovia, Indiana — and just swallow it up? The captured populace would be forced to give up their way of life; after being absorbed into the victor’s workforce, their old burg would be smashed to bits. You could see how that might be a pretty potent metaphor for paranoia over cultural coastal elites and big-city-vs.-“real”-America argument-stoking, right? We’re guessing the folks behind this adaptation of Philip Reeves’ novel noticed it as well, in addition to how his intriguing, high-concept 2001 book is the first in a quartet and my, wouldn’t it be lovely to have a franchise! The warship-like behemoth that we see chasing down a tiny, speedy burg in the movie’s opening is not Gotham, but London; its prey isn’t an everyplace from our midwest but some generic mining-town named Salthook, meant to represent every industrial burg fallen on hard times. As for the money shot of this massive urban giant sucking the jalopy of a village into is maw — “Prepare to ingest!” is the command that’s issued — it’s indeed awesome, in the traditional sense of the word. Any outside-the-multiplex messaging, however, pretty much starts and stops there, unless you count the “Be aware that children may be temporarily separated from parents” warning over a loudspeaker. The writer-producer trio of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens were all responsible for the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, as was their longtime collaborator Christian Rivers, the film’s director — so their business is fantasy, the more far-out the better. Their not here to make parallels, per se. They want to give you a sci-fi extravaganza — some sort of steampunk-on-steroids Metropocalypse Now! And they’re willing to use the spare parts of dozens of other movies to make it happen. A partial list of lenders would include The Terminator, Snowpiercer, Frankenstein, The Road Warrior, Howl’s Moving Castle, Star Wars (and every WWII dogfight epic that inspired it), Brazil (and other Gilliamesque romps, notably his Meaning of Life short “The Crimson Permanent Assurance”) and every third Roger Dean painting/album cover. All sort of hero’s-journey narratives come into play, from the ordinary young man thrown into extraordinary circumstances — in this case, a tinkering nerd named Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) — to someone on a vengeance quest, e.g. a scarred rebel named Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar). There’s a villain, played by Hugo Weaving with his patented Matrix-level of malevolence, who’s been gathering vintage weapons-grade tech for a — wait for it — vintage weapon. As a bonus, the movie throws in a robot/automaton character that’s both a tormentor and tragic, and a Han Solo-like rogue pilot/outlaw who goes by the handle “Anna Fang.” She’s played by Jihae Kim, a musician with an illegal amount of screen presence and who, in a perfect non-dystopian world, would be cast in at least half of the movies coming out next year. It’s not a what you steal but how well you synthesize, of course, and Mortal Engines does a decent enough job of blending a shit-ton of your favorite movies, books, TV shows etc. together for a bit. Yet the result still feels like an off-brand blockbuster, something that doesn’t track as a big-screen take on a beloved book series so much as a collection of narrative notions — like a project that never quite got past the conceptual-art phase. As a distraction, it’s inoffensive. But you can tell it wants to be the juggernaut on wheels, the unstoppable giant mowing down or devouring everything in its path. It’s really the smaller thing trying desperately to outrun oblivion. It’s all scraps and nothing but."
"Dec 21, 2018",positive," Based on the first in a series of Young Adult novels by Philip Reeve, Mortal Engines is yet another film set in a post-apocalyptic future wherein food and water are scarce, the strong prey on the weak, and Mennen Speed Sticks and other hygienic niceties have doubtless long ceased to exist. The largest cities have been placed on wheels and roam the wastelands, devouring smaller towns (i.e. integrating the citizenry into their own but stealing all of their resources). London is the largest of such burgs practicing what is known as “Municipal Darwinism,” and its chief architect is Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), who of course is soon revealed to be a murderous opportunist. It’s up to the bitter Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and the naïve Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) to bring him down, although they have plenty of allies — chief among them are a rebel leader known as Anna Fang (singer Jihae) and Valentine’s own daughter (Leila George). The plot is both daft and derivative (there’s even a Vader-friendly “No, I am your father” moment), and the commonplace YA elements end up overtaking the welcome WTF moments by the end. But because this comes from Peter Jackson (here in producing and scripting modes) and many other folks involved with The Lord of the Rings, the world-building is spectacular and almost makes this worth the price of admission. Steampunk is the driving style here, and this might be the first live-action movie to successfully mimic the design of Hayao Miyazaki’s animated epics. Howl’s Moving Castle and Castle in the Sky loom large, and while there’s no catbus co-opted from My Neighbor Totoro, there is a camouflaged vehicle that scurries along like a metallic caterpillar. Like its setting, Mortal Engines ultimately becomes too cluttered for its own good, and the final showdown feels endless. But there are some compensations among the characters. Tom makes for a bland protagonist, but Hester’s backstory provides her with some interesting shadings. And then there’s Shrike (Stephen Lang), an intriguing figure who’s two parts Terminator, one part Grinch. Like the good Arnie T-800, he’s Hester’s former protector. Like the bad Arnie T-800, he becomes her hunter. And like the Dr. Seuss grouch, he’s noticeably lacking a heart. Of course, there’s eventually a scene where his non-existent heart somehow ends up growing “three sizes that day.” To quote from another Shakespearean work, “If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.” But since it’s a movie being played upon a screen, I merely take such nonsense in stride."
"Dec 21, 2018",negative," When Disney and Sony reached an agreement a couple of years ago to allow Spidey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, an apparent loophole allowed Sony to produce animated Spider-Man movies. Now they've exploited that, and produced the best animated movie of 2018. By focusing on the black, teenaged, Miles Morales version of Spider-Man, introducing him to a half-dozen other Spider-Men (and women, and a pig) from other dimensions, and combining that with creative animation, directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman have created the best Spidey film since Sam Raimi's 2004 Spider-Man 2. The film is co-produced by The LEGO Movie auteurs Phil Lord and Chris Miller, with Lord getting a story credit, and there's so much to love here. The visual style. The depiction of New York City, where it's the present day, but at the same time (thanks to graffitied subway cars), it sort of feels like 1992. Excellent voiceovers by Brian Tyree Henry and Mahershala Ali as Miles' father and uncle, respectively. The characterization of an older version of the Peter Parker Spider-Man, voiced by Jake Johnson, which is surprisingly poignant. Even the Stan Lee cameo, usually an afterthought, is especially heartbreaking, following Lee's recent death. Does Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse suffer at all, as nothing less than the fourth launch of a new Spider-Man series since 2002? Not really. It's so different, and so expansive, that I didn’t mind.  Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier returns with The House That Jack Built, his first film in five years. It's a movie that's so consistent with the themes of the director's previous work—violence, narcissism, long-windedness—that von Trier can't resist including clips of some of his own past movies at one point. Set in the 1970s in an unnamed part of the U.S., the film stars Matt Dillon as Jack, a prolific serial killer. We see several of his murders, carried out with varying degrees of depravity. But the film also spends much of its time on voiceovers, including an ""interview"" device that isn't explained until the end, in which Jack pontificates about art, architecture, Hitler, and why he hates women. Throughout, he sounds like a pretentious middle-aged man who just discovered the work of Jordan Peterson. If Jack existed in the present day instead of the 70s, he'd never kill anyone, because he'd be too busy with his YouTube channel. Some think this movie is hilarious, but I'm not seeing that, except for a stunt-casting joke at the end that made me smile. I mostly found the film a gross, unpleasant slog, despite a capable turn from Dillon, who doesn't get used nearly enough these days. It's been a long time since Peter Jackson last made a good movie, and the dry spell continues with Mortal Engines, which answers a burning question: What if Mad Max: Fury Road had sucked? Written and produced by Jackson and his wife Fran Walsh, and directed by Jackson protégé Christian Rivers, Mortal Engines is based on everybody's favorite: a fantasy novel with four sequels. It's the post-apocalyptic future, and in a not-so-subtle allegory of imperialism, the city of London is now predatory, ambulatory and extremely steampunk, as a dictator type (Hugo Weaving) moves it around the planet in order to gobble up other places and civilizations. At the center of the story is Hester (Icelandic actress/discount Kristen Stewart Hera Hilmar), a young woman out for revenge against the bad guys. She's assisted by (Robert Sheehan), a poor orphan who really wants to fly planes. Mortal Engines is an obvious rehash of George Miller's great 2015 Mad Max: Fury Road, minus just about every one of that film's positive qualities. The action is choppy and boring, the characters are terrible, the effects are garish CGI instead of practical and none of the stakes are compelling. And then, after 90 minutes, the film suddenly stops ripping off Mad Max and pivots to Star Wars, complete with a Death Star-like weapon, a Luke-style assault on it, and a score that's a brazen knockoff of John Williams. The world-building is so piss-poor that the nuclear holocaust that kicks off the film is hardly explained and quickly an afterthought. It's never especially clear which direction the characters are going and what their motivation is. And probably the worst choice is that the film treats one character's death with wistful music and a treacly montage, when everything we've learned is that the character was essentially an abusive stepfather. Mary Queen of Scots pales in comparison to The Favourite, and even to the otherwise mostly forgettable Outlaw King. A typically winning performance in the title role by Saoirse Ronan can't save a tepid, boring historical drama. Directed by Josie Rourke, a first-timer from the London theater scene, Mary was written by Beau Willimon, who with The Ides of March and House of Cards has cornered the market across multiple media on mediocre works about political intrigue. The film tells the story of Mary (Ronan) and her feud with cousin Queen Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie.) Complicating things are that the two never met in real life, so the movie invents a meeting scene that's really the only time the film comes alive. I get the point the film’s trying to make—both women faced pressures and challenges that they in no way deserved, especially Elizabeth, who is portrayed by a miscast Robbie as a smallpox-addled grotesquerie. But the lackluster script just can’t find a way to make any of this interesting. Opening this film at the same as The Favourite, which attempts most of the same things but does all of them much better, was nearly an act of studio malpractice."
"Dec 21, 2018",neutral,"This big budget, effects-laden movie about a strange post-apocalyptic world where predator cities roll around on tank-like treads looks great, but the story of romance and revenge is just barely adequate."
"Dec 21, 2018",negative,The last two acts drag it down... it just goes Star Wars.
"Dec 21, 2018",negative,I fell asleep.... I was getting tired of these people... and the funny thing is that I put everything together.
"Dec 21, 2018",neutral,"This should've been amazing. Even the ending owes itself to another film...it feels like a bunch of movies we've seen before, that are better than this."
"Dec 21, 2018",positive," To its credit, it doesn’t really feel like a stab at that potentially lucrative market, where crummy movies such as Hunger Games can pay off big dividends. Produced and written by the Lord of the Rings trio of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, it layers a certain loopy majesty on a premise that is, well, pretty strange. Roughly 1,000 years into the future, the world is a realm of fugitives and scavengers, save for the residents of “predator cities,” roving metropolises on giant caterpillar tracks capable of swallowing whole the small towns foraging in its path. (Think Mad Max attempting to speed away from an ambulatory Brisbane and you get the idea.) In the opening sequence, the city of London, commanded by Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), descends on and “ingests” a mining town, ripping apart the structure for fuel and presumably enslaving its citizens. (Restraint points to director Christian Rivers for bucking any urge to set the whole sequence to The Clash’s London Calling.) One young woman in the town, scar-faced Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), uses the occasion to make an attempt on the life of Valentine, but is stopped from her mission by ambitious archeologist Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), who hopes to be mentored by the powerful London kingpin. That doesn’t work out. Soon, both Hester and Tom are abandoned in the wasteland, and Valentine is seeking information on his mysterious attacker, a pursuit that leads to the barely human Shrike (Stephen Lang in a motion-capture performance), a battle cyborg “resurrected” from the body of a soldier ages earlier. Shrike is released from his prison to fulfil his stated mission: killing Hester. That frees Valentine to pursue a mission of his own: employing the same technology that all but destroyed the world to take power for himself, much to the growing consternation of his daughter Katherine (Leila George). Production-wise, the film is a cut above the Hunger Games ilk. While this is a first feature for Rivers, producer Jackson knows a thing or two about creating a strange new world from whole digital cloth, and the film is rife with vistas desolate and beautiful. As antagonists go, Shrike is an especially impressive creation, suggesting what would happen if an Iron Giant-style robot opted for an operating system of pure malevolence. For the lead roles, the film opted for comparative unknowns, a risky proposition, notwithstanding precedents along the lines of Star Wars. Hilmar brings a certain fury to the role, possibly driven by having to act out the cliché of the beautiful woman who believes herself to be hideous because of a facial scar. As Tom, Sheehan brings a dangerous amount of “academic twit” to the role, making for an unusual if not altogether likable hero. The film is an adaptation of the first in a series of books by Philip Reeve, and given the critical drubbing the movie is getting — it’s currently 30 per cent at Rotten Tomatoes — it’s not likely any film sequels will be forthcoming."
"Dec 20, 2018",negative," It's some years into a dystopian future and marauding city machines – like Laputa, in Castle in the Sky, or Howl's Moving Castle – rove around on wheels in search of smaller, weaker city machines to absorb and enslave. The cruellest imperialists of the lot live in the city of London, an endlessly greedy empire determined to gobble all of continental Europe knowing all the while that their own system is unsustainable. Insert your own punchline here. Within the city limits, a dashing apprentice historian, Tom Natsworthy (the impossibly charismatic Robert Sheehan), collects old tech and heroically intervenes when a mysterious young woman named Hester Shaw attempts to assassinate the ambitious head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). It’s a Hugo Weaving character. What could possibly go wrong? Thus, Tom and resourceful rebel Hester find themselves dumped out of London and into the badlands. And then they’re kidnapped by Ozploitation-friendly slave traders. And a Terminator named Shrike chases them. And they’re rescued by Anna Fang (a swaggering turn from the South Korean pop star Jihae), the leader of the Anti-Traction League, a resistance group. And then there’s a bomb. And so on. Christian Rivers, Peter Jackson’s long-time storyboard artist, makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of Philip Reeve’s award-winning novel, a lavish, spectacular, messy picture containing some thrilling set pieces and far too much tedious world-building. Mortal Engines never quite settles on a protagonist – Tom, Hester and Anna are all in the running – making for a lopsided narrative that still somehow diligently hits every predictable genre beat. “We’re not going to tell each other our sad stories,” harrumphs Hester about 20 minutes before she trots out the first of two tragic backstories. Two! Even the collective screen charms of Sheehan and Jihae can’t compensate for the project’s lack of personality. As impressive as it looks, Mortal Engines is pathologically wedded to its steampunk aesthetic. Often it feels like being battered half to death with a copy of Cherie Priest's Boneshaker. Even the goggles seem to have goggles. In the moments before the crucial save-the-world climax, Tom turns back so that he can face his steampunk Waterloo wearing a more steampunky jacket. No one blinks an eye."
"Dec 19, 2018",negative,"Nothing about ""Mortal Engines"" works. Not the story. Not the aesthetics. Not the performances. Nothing. Just tow this clunker to the junkyard and be done with it."
"Dec 18, 2018",neutral," A thousand years in the future, when the population has been decimated by war and society is starting over again, the hot new trend in municipal planning is “traction cities,” where entire towns are built on massive machines that travel on enormous tank treads, roaming the countryside like pirate ships. (They’re small as “cities” go, maybe the size of a couple city blocks — still, pretty big to be out rolling around Europe.) This is “Mortal Engines,” adapted by Peter Jackson and friends from the first of Philip Reeve’s four Young Adult novels, directed by first-timer Christian Rivers with all the enthusiasm of someone who’s getting his big break and can’t do anything about the boring script his producers handed him. On the good ship London, a feckless young apprentice named Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) teams up with justifiably angry Irish lass Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) to bring down the sinister Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), a London leader who killed Hester’s mother in his quest to find a legendary weapon that could make London even more of a giant, deadly bully than it already is. There’s a resistance made up of people who understand that “traction cities” are unsustainable (they require incredible amounts of fuel), giving Tom and Hester a group to join. They’ve created an awesome world here, with cool sets and steampunk devices — like a teen version of “Mad Max: Fury Road.” But the story is wholly unremarkable, composed of the generic beats you’ve seen in other YA adaptations, and the characters are all forgettable. There’s not a single noteworthy performance in the bunch, not even from Hugo Weaving as the villain. Like the rolling city of London, the movie is a gigantic, lumbering waste of resources populated by nobody interesting."
"Dec 18, 2018",negative," I’ve been at turns frustrated and fascinated by the new sci-fi film Mortal Engines in the lead-up to its release. A giant tale about mobile cities ingesting smaller cities and the kids trying to stop them was always going to be an odd sell to those not directly familiar with Philip Reeve’s young adult novels that producer Peter Jackson has been enamored with for decades now, but it got made anyway.  Here’s some haphazardly-explained exposition for you: In the middle of the 21st Century, a series of quantum weapons called M.E.D.U.S.A destroyed pretty much all of the large cities of the world, and ruined the Earth’s crust. And then we’ve got moving cities! Hooray! Or, at least that’s how Rivers and Jackson explain it (though it’s not really well-explained in the film, a quick look at the book’s Wikipedia page will tell you that survivors from those destroyed cities moved into those mobile cities in order to escape the constantly-changing weather conditions like earthquakes or giant storms caused by the Earth’s crust being fucked with). It’s somewhere in the far future, and young Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) is onboard a small city that, in the film’s thrilling 20 minutes, gets consumed by the giant moving city of London. London is a bit of a wonder, complete with tube stations and the “London Museum” of old artifacts, the latter where our co-protagonist Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) works. He meets Hester by happenstance, when she’s about to assassinate Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), the leader of the Guild of Historians, for murdering her mother. Natsworthy and Shaw are thrown off of London, and have to fend for themselves against a whole host of enemies so that they can stop Valentine from attempting to revive the M.E.D.U.S.A project to wreck havoc on the city’s enemies. Anyways, the effects work, as with every film that the good folks at Weta Digital work on, is as brilliant as it normally is. The cities have a brutal heft to them, and their stacked design makes them wonderfully interesting to look at. The airships, as well, are distinct — swashbuckler Anna Fang’s little red ship looks like if the Swordfish from Cowboy Bebop were more of a lobster, and if I were ten years old still, I’d probably be running around my town to figure out if I could buy a model kit of it. The action is filmed well enough, which was to be a given, thanks to Rivers’ past experience with Jackson, and when the film goes full Star Wars knock-off in the last half hour, it at least looks somewhat fun (seriously, I was humming this throughout the entire airship/London battle — one wonders when Jackson’s finally just going to suck it up and make his Dam Busters remake). However, this is all a bit funny, given that all of these scenes are memorable because they look nothing like the rest of the film, which is shot like an exceptionally bad BBC adaptation of a Dickens novel, just in a steam-punk universe. The action, when it doesn’t involve any effects work, is about as poorly photographed as any herky-jerky bullshit you’d find in a shaky-cam action film, and that’s a big downgrade from Jackson’s clear action work in all of his prior films (including those, like this, that he’s produced). There’s not much in Mortal Engines to hang one’s thematic hat on: There are slight references to conspicuous consumption, colonialism and more baked into the film, which I’m assuming are a bit more of the point in the novels that the film is based on, but Rivers largely ignores them for a “don’t repeat the mistakes of the past” message. You know, the one you’ll find in pretty much every movie about overly-ambitious scientists dealing with tech they don’t really understand. Yet these nods are roughly enough to give the film a color that, much like Jupiter Ascending and plenty of other films before it, sort of lives and dies on its imagery more so than its storytelling.  Is Mortal Engines a bad movie? Hell yeah, it absolutely is: It’s probably one of the worst movies I’ve seen this year on a storytelling level. It overextends the meager powers of its director, may cause its cast not to have as long and as profitable careers as they would otherwise, and is virtually identical, at least from a financial standpoint, as Universal’s studio head lighting a $100 million on fire. Yet, warts and all, is it a blast to roll with when the going is good — all of the action sequences involving effects work, Weaving’s celluloid chewing — and to chuckle at when things start to get bad? Absolutely. Maybe watch it at home, though, if you have trouble stifling a giggle. "
"Dec 18, 2018",positive," The biggest worry for me going into this film was would my suspension of disbelief hold out? Fantasy it may be and that should be all it requires to buy into its rules for the duration, but would I be able to watch a city trundling around a dystopian landscape on gargantuan caterpillar tracks cannibalising other smaller cities and not keep thinking of Monty Pythons, Crimson Permanent Assurance? I needn’t have worried; the high-octane opening showing a giant London on caterpillar tracks chasing a small Bavarian mining Village was presented with such straightforward sense of adventure and desperation that the snickers soon left, though now and again I did find myself thinking of what Mad Max might be like if it had been directed by Terry Gilliam.. Mortal Engines, based on the first of a series of books by Phillip French belongs firmly to the steam punk genre, where old-school Victorian values blend with sci-fi subject matter, normally set in alternative worlds. Mortal Engines is set in a far future after the Sixty Minute war laid waste to the world and a new order of scavenging evolved where travelling cities known as traction cities traverse the landscape living out of what they find left over from the past.  We enter this world as it is on the verge of collapse, conflict has risen between the traction cities, notably London and those that have begun to resettle properly on the land in a place not unlike the mythological Shangri-La. Following a path of revenge against this backdrop is Hester (Hera Hilmar), who aims to kill Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), an ambitious leader of the traction City of London. An unsuccessful attempt brings her to the attention of Tom Natsworty (Robert Sheehan), a young assistant in the city museum, who in turn realises that Valentine is not the great man he thought he was when he ejects him from the city because he knows the truth of Hester’s mission. Soon the two are in the wasteland making their way to god knows where while Hugo is reaching the completion of his master plan. As would be expected of any film that has Peter Jackson’s (writer, producer) moniker attached to it, this is a sumptuous affair, beautifully realised in design and costume and featuring some dazzling effects.  He may not have his name attached as director but it is obvious that his influence on the director, Christian Rivers, is significant. A lot of Jackson’s hallmark shots are up on the screen in this production. It is unfortunate that the frenetic style that opens the film is maintained for the entire narrative. Characters are introduced at high speed and given no proper emotional weight, barring one or two of them. No one seems to really stop to take a breath, though some sleep is had along the way. Most surprising is that the writing from Peter Jackson and his wife, Fran Walsh, seems so formulaic and predictable. This may be because of the source material, I couldn’t truly say but even so, from what I have learned of the books the wealth of background detail that went into realising the world of the story in the novels is certainly not given enough credence here. The overarching plot stifles any characterisation from properly emerging. The characters for the most part serve their functions rather than have any real sense of an inner life. As the narrative and action escalates it finally descends into a sort of steampunk version of Star Wars. Despite those negatives there is a lot of joy to be had from this epic adventure. If spectacle is what you are after, you will find plenty, even if it does go on a tad too long. At a time when most blockbusters are so busy setting up their sequels, it is refreshing that this film, though possibly hoping to be the first of a series, stands on its own as a narrative."

New Zealander Christian Rivers always had a love for movies growing up and, in an attempt to break into the industry, the 17-year-old sent a bunch of drawings into Peter Jackson in the early 1990s with hopes of landing a job.  It worked.  Rivers was hired as a storyboard artist for the zombie comedy Braindead (released back in 1992) and since then, he has been a part of every Peter Jackson directed film in a number of capacities.  He even won an Oscar in 2006 as a visual effects artist on King Kong. Decades of experience have led Rivers to this moment – an opportunity to sit in the director’s chair and pull the strings on his first feature film.  There’s a lot at stake too.  Fans of Philip Reeve’s best-selling 2001 novel will be curious to see how it has been condensed and adapted for the big screen.  Investors will be nervous given the $100 million budget and the largely unknown cast.  The future of this new franchise will most likely be determined by the early box-office. This will sound like a backhanded compliment (probably because it is) but the film’s most interesting element is the world in which it’s set.  The human race was all but obliterated in the early 22nd century when the Earth’s crust shattered during the “Sixty Minute War”.  Mortal Engines is set another 1,600 years after that cataclysmic event where technology has regressed (it was all lost during the war) and humans have created a very different way of living. In rebuilding the world from scratch, leaders got creative.  High-rise cities such as London were set on wheels so they could move about the world in search of food, water and energy.  It sounds practical but there’s also a more sinister element.  Large predatory cities attack smaller ones and the citizens watch with amusement as if it’s some kind of sport.  This is illustrated in an action-packed opening sequence which, to the backdrop of a pulsating film score from Antonius Holkenborg, creates a cool Mad Max: Fury Road type vibe. If only the story had the same level of creativity and originality.  Instead, we’ve got some characters repeatedly throwing up cheesy lines and others providing obvious spoilers as to their fate (“if I should die…”)  Perhaps the narrative could have been saved by a charismatic, thought-provoking villain but again, that’s lacking here.  Australian Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) plays Thaddeus Valentine, the quasi-mayor of a giant city who seems to be driven by power and nothing else.  There’s no subtlety to the character nor any reason to appreciate his point of view.  I don’t even know why people fight alongside him. The team of “good guys” are headlined by Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar (An Ordinary Man) and Irish-born Robert Sheehan (Misfits).  They play two stereotypical heroes, Hester and Tom, who are tasked with the responsibility of removing Thaddeus from power.  They also develop a romantic connection which ticks off another genre (in addition to action, comedy, drama and sci-fi).  The only appealing character in the mix is a green-eyed robot named Shrike (played by Stephen Lang) who, unlike everyone else, is tricky to read and keeps you guessing."
"Dec 18, 2018",negative," As a battle rages in London over whether Britain should withdraw from the European Union, the sci-fi epic Mortal Engines offers the opposite scenario — London on wheels, rolling across Europe and ingesting smaller cities. Mortal Engines is another post-apocalypse from another series of YA novels (this time by Philip Reeve), though this one is distinguished by the spare-no-expense budget needed to build its imaginative, detailed and (mostly) unique world, designed with steampunk motifs suited to the idea of a scavenger society assembling a new world from spare parts of the old. The film is directed by Christian Rivers, special effects coordinator for Peter Jackson on the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies (Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh provide the script). Those franchises relied increasingly on special effects as they matured — often favoring digital spectacle over story and character — and that emphasis is certainly in evidence here. Rivers’ vision is something to see — I was particularly impressed with the flying machines that turn up midway through, powered by Osprey-style tilting engines, steered by fins and sails that suggest flying fish and sailing ships. Yet while the movie is often dazzling, it’s also frequently dull. There is an inert human story at its core, centered on a young woman named Hester (Hera Hilmar) with a lethal grudge against the sinister leader (Hugo Weaving) of the marauding metropolis city of London. She starts out as his prisoner, then his prey — on the run from the rolling city, roving the dangerous wasteland accompanied by a London outcast named Tom (Robert Sheehan) wearing a British Invasion band outfit and a mod mop-top to match. Tom’s a bit of a stumblebum, and Hester saves him more than once, but she notices that he’s earnestly taken with her, and stands by her when he has a chance to bolt, something that resonates with her past. I’d like to say that sparks fly, but the chemistry between these two actors is nonexistent (hurt by some bad dialogue), and it’s a big problem for Mortal Engines, a movie desperately short on emotion (despite a bombastic score designed to cue them). There is actually more depth of feeling between Hester and Shrike (Stephen Lang) the robot dispatched to killer her. Shrike is straight out of The Terminator — the eyes glow green instead of red, but he makes the same hydraulic whirring when he moves, and his giant feet clomp with the same metal-on-metal sound. There’s also a rebel leader (Jihae) with Matrix eyewear, a flowing coat, and a cool sidearm, and while that seems like an affectionate homage, other forms of borrowing are less excusable, especially as they make the movie predictable. The finale is pure Star Wars. London-on-Wheels essentially turns into a death star with a weapon that must be disabled before it destroys the stronghold of the rebel alliance. Airborne fighters swoop in, dodging deck guns, but at least the light sabers are absent."
"Dec 17, 2018",negative," Main message seems to be ""kill or be killed."" Even ""good guys"" don't hesitate before blowing someone away. The two main characters have destinies that they must fulfill, but these, too, are based on destruction and death. The characters are so flat that they barely register as characters, let alone role models. They spend most of the movie destroying things, running, trying to look cool. Frequent use of guns, shooting, missiles, explosions. Characters die, sometimes violently. Sharp blades/spikes and stabbing/slicing. Moderate blood from wounds, including bullet wounds. Bloodiness ramps up in final battle. Scary monster-robot creature. Creepy imagery. Lots of chasing/falling/crashing. Punching. Reference to ""drinking own urine."" Slave market shown; people being sold to cannibals. Parents need to know that Mortal Engines is a sci-fi/fantasy movie based on a young adult novel by Philip Reeve and adapted and produced by Peter Jackson (among others). Big fans of the book and/or steampunk enthusiasts may like it, but others are likely to find it mechanical and derivative. It's too childish for most teens and too brutally violent for most children, especially in the climactic battle. There's frequent gun use and shooting, plus explosions, stabbing, and slicing, with blood. Characters die, sometimes quite violently. Viewers can also expect to see a scary robot-skeleton monster and plenty of other intense, creepy images. Language is on the mild side but includes ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""bastard,"" etc. There's an extremely tame romance between the main female and male characters; they touch hands, gaze into each other's eyes, and finally hug. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In MORTAL ENGINES, it's the distant future, and the world has been ravaged. Cities are now giant roving vehicles that are constantly searching for food and fuel. The biggest is London, where Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) is collecting old tech to build something in secret. Meanwhile, a girl from the wastelands, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), makes her way onboard London and tries to kill Valentine. She's stopped by a historian named Tom (Robert Sheehan), who works at the city's museum. Hester and Tom are both dropped into the wastes, where they're rescued by a rebel pilot, Anna Fang (Jihae). Unfortunately, a ""resurrected"" monster (Stephen Lang) is after Hester, and Valentine's daughter, Katherine (Leila George), discovers what her father is really up to. Can the good guys stop the villains in time? Simpleminded and mechanical, this movie clumsily borrows from every sci-fi/fantasy movie of the last 40 years, smushing everything together with inept filmmaking and a total lack of logic or emotion. Based on a young adult novel by Philip Reeve and -- shockingly -- adapted by Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh, Mortal Engines does have some cool costumes and production design, but that only goes so far. The rest is numbingly familiar. The movie doesn't even seem to take any joy in its copying; rather than paying homage to anything, it's a slavish, soulless piece of work, as if done by a computer cut-and-paste application. It's not even any fun. It's certainly too childish for teen viewers -- but it's also too brutally violent for younger viewers. The sloppily shot and hastily cut action sequences are piled on top of other scenes that don't stick to any kind of character logic or need; everything that happens serves only the plot. The dialogue is wince-inducing, and characters spend most of the movie either scowling (trying to look cool) or staring slack-jawed at some impressive piece of scenery. By the end, it becomes painfully clear that most of the incessant stealing can be traced to the Star Wars movies; Mortal Engines has the dubious honor of making even the worst entries in that series look accomplished and admirable.

"Dec 17, 2018",negative,"First-time director (but long-time special-effects person) Christian Rivers is too focused on technical wizardry, and the result is headache-inducing chaos."
"Dec 17, 2018",negative," I recently had the pleasure of visiting a friend of some means who had bought himself a new Tesla. I’ve never been in a Tesla, never really even seen one up close, and he eagerly gave me a tour of it. And my god, the thing is a damn marvel of science and technology and engineering. Those people have thought of everything, every detail, every perk. Its interior is essentially controlled by what looks like a large tablet screen and other than a gear shifter and a turn signal, that’s the entirety of its dashboard and gauges. It gives you everything, conveniently, at the push of a button. It’s intuitive and intelligent and wholly fascinating to look at. I will readily admit that it met my skepticism of the brand head-on and blew past me. And when we took it for a drive — not far, just through his neighborhood to get some pizza for our kids — it was like being inside a smooth, silent, mechanical shark. I say this not because I’m looking for a Tesla endorsement or trying to get you to spend absurd amounts of money on a car, but because the encounter kept popping into my mind as I watched Mortal Engines last night. Based on the novel of the same name by Phillip Reeves (the novel is the first of four), it takes place in a wild future where civilization as we know it was wiped out by our own hubris and arrogant use of a superweapon. What’s left is a steampunk-y society of cities and towns that are always moving, rolling creakily on massive tracks and wheels throughout a barren landscape. The smaller towns live in constant fear of being hunted for parts and resources by “Predator Cities,” the largest and most dangerous of which is London. London’s chief engineer is Valentine (Hugo Weaving), a seemingly kind but actually viciously ambitious man determined to resurrect the weapons of the past to further London’s dominance. He’s challenged by Hester (Hera Hilmar), a scarred orphan with a vendetta, and Tom (Robert Sheehan), a young museum curator-in-training who unwittingly stumbles into the whole affair and joins forces with Hester. Along the way, they encounter other rebellious allies, including Anna Fang (South Korean singer/songwriter Jihae) as they fight towards stopping Valentine. And much like that Tesla, Mortal Engines is absolutely beautiful to look at. The film is stunning in its worldbuilding, in its visual pizzazz, in its intricate and almost delicate attention to detail. From costume design to set design to engineering, it’s a gorgeous, wondrous, and rather original new world for the big screen. The Steampunk genre has never really effectively made its way into films and this feels like the closest we’ve ever come. The cities themselves, giant rumbling monstrosities that defy all logic, feel vibrant and alive. The same can be said of the weird, alien airships that Anna Fang and her comrades fly — no, sail — through the skies.  But this isn’t a Tesla. This is someone who took the hollowed-out shell of a Tesla and stuck an ‘85 Chevy Celebrity inside. Because despite its gorgeous visuals, Mortal Engines has little new to show you in terms of story. It takes a little while to realize how much of it is simply cobbled together, pirated bits from other, better films and novels, right down to its “boy who always wanted to be a pilot having a hero moment where he flies into the heart of the machine to make that one perfect shot to save the day” climax. There are so many storytelling elements that are lazy shortcuts. And of course, shortcuts are necessary evil when adapting to film (although truth be told, the film changes too many things around for its purposes, taking away some of the book’s charm), but these are less shortcuts and more narrative leaps, from a telescoped romance that never clicks to a series of utterly jaw-dropping coincidences, Mortal Engines takes all the capital it accrued with its visuals and wastes it on its drab story. Everything is predictable and the characters never really engage you. Robert Sheehan’s Tom stumbles around stupidly through the first half, never really earning the hero mantle he’s essentially gifted by circumstance. Hilmar’s Hester is pretty good, though frankly the character would have worked better on her own, rather than being bogged down with Tom and his dull baggage. What you’ll really be pining for is the story of Anna Fang, clever, funny, fierce fighter, pirate, and pilot who speaks like an utter badass and obviously skipped school the day they taught the lessons on fear. She’s a relentlessly bad bitch and she needs her own something, stat. There’s a lot of wasted potential in Mortal Engines, and that will come (frustratingly) as no surprise when you see that Peter Jackson had his hands all over this production as producer and co-screenwriter. Much like in some of his Lord of the Rings work — most notably the wretched Hobbit trilogy — he can’t leave well enough alone and is determined to leave his own stamp on everything, ultimately doing more harm than good. Mortal Engines could have been a fine film and a serviceable jumping point for a new franchise, featuring a unique and lovely new type of dystopia. But there’s no chance that this world goes any further. This thing is doomed from the start. It’s going to stumble through a crowded Christmas season, losing the race to better films, ultimately to be relegated to the junkyard of missed opportunities."
"Dec 17, 2018",positive," A big-budget movie about a dystopian future in which mobile cities devour each other? This risk somehow did not pan out at the box office, and may be one of the last cautionary tales of its kind. It’s essential that I set the scene for Mortal Engines, considering not only its surprisingly convoluted dystopian story line, but also the fact almost nobody went to see the film in its debut weekend.  The opening set piece of Mortal Engines is an extension of the film’s first teaser—which laid out the movie’s general premise of “What if cities … moved?”—as the “predator city” of London is practicing “Municipal Darwinism.” That is a fancy way of saying the rule of law in this decrepit future is that big cities swallow small towns—literally—if they’re able to chase them down. It’s survival of the fittest, metropolis edition. We watch as a small mining settlement tries its best to evade London, heading toward a crevice that the giant city wouldn’t be able to squeeze through. Unfortunately, the jagged terrain isn’t doing the settlement any favors as it keeps losing momentum, and once London is close enough the city attaches its harpoons—a death blow. “PREPARE TO INGEST!” Hugo Weaving’s London leader Thaddeus Valentine shouts to his subordinates as—I can’t believe I’m typing this—London opens its mechanical maw and, indeed, ingests an entire town. Once London closes its, uh, mouth, the MORTAL ENGINES title flashes on the screen. In perhaps the wildest 15 minutes of a blockbuster movie this year, Mortal Engines evangelized me to all of its ridiculous glory.  While the rest of Mortal Engines fails to reach the highs of its lurid opening set piece, there are a lot of intriguing elements at play thanks to the film’s particularly strange world-building conceit, taken from the eponymous Philip Reeve novel that serves as its source material. You see, a cataclysmic event called the “Sixty Minute War” destroyed civilization as we know it, and the vestiges of old societies became mobile cities, which could “ingest” smaller communities and use their resources and fuel to keep chugging along in this dystopian landscape. Not all of humanity turned to inflated Mad Max cosplay, however: an “Anti-Traction League” was formed in what used to be Asia, protected by a giant border wall to ward off the chaos of the warring cities. Valentine’s nefarious plot revolves around gathering enough resources to build a nuclear-type device like one used in the Sixty Minute War that could destroy that giant wall. Meanwhile, the film’s protagonist, Hester Shaw (played by Hera Hilmar), plans to assassinate Valentine as revenge for killing her mother when Hester was a little girl, though she eventually gets pulled into the larger conflict between London and the Anti-Traction League and finds that a key revelation from her past could save everyone—as these stories usually go.  I could keep going—there’s also a subplot involving Hester and a Terminator-zombie-type thing called Shrike (played by an unrecognizable Stephen Lang), who helped raise her after her mother died. There are cameos by the Minions—yes, those Minions, courtesy of a museum in London that collects relics of the 21st century, but mostly because Illumination Entertainment is a subsidiary of Universal Pictures—and NFL player Michael Bennett (I guess he’s a steampunk enthusiast?). Mortal Engines is truly absurd in an endearingly strange way.  There’s a confluence of factors involved in a movie bombing this badly. It doesn’t help that Mortal Engines was dropped in the middle of a chaotic December schedule, competing against a Wreck-It Ralph sequel, a new Spider-Man movie, and, in a week’s time, the new Mary Poppins film, Aquaman, and the Transformers spinoff Bumblebee. That kind of competition is particularly daunting for a film based on fairly unfamiliar IP—the first Mortal Engines novel, the basis of the movie, was published in 2001—that needs to bridge the information gap. The easiest thing that could be inferred from the trailers was the “cities are moving now” conceit, which is certainly a fun idea, but evidently not enough to convince moviegoers to seek it out in droves over the well-reviewed familiarity and nostalgia derived from a character like Spider-Man.  Box office bombs are unavoidable in moviemaking; there’s always going to be a handful of big swings each year that fail the generate the hype to match their enormous production costs. Last year, it was projects like The Dark Tower, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and especially Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, which struggled to such an extent that it was primarily responsible for its production company shuttering within a year. Like Valerian, itself based on a European comic that didn’t have a global mainstream appeal, Mortal Engines was perhaps always destined to be a flop. Nowadays, if a blockbuster isn’t a gritty reboot, a superhero film, or a new Star Wars project, it is increasingly difficult for that movie to be more than a sunk cost.  The best time for Mortal Engines to thrive would’ve been when the fantasy genre peaked around the time of the original Harry Potter franchise and Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. (Jackson is a cowriter and executive producer for Mortal Engines.) There hasn’t been an heir apparent to the fantasy blockbuster—unless you count Game of Thrones’ game-changing popularity on HBO—since the last Harry Potter film came out in 2011, as superhero movies have completely taken over. There have certainly been enough attempts at launching fantasy franchises in the following years: The Golden Compass in 2007, YA dystopian fare like The Maze Runner and the Divergent series, and more recently the new Fantastic Beasts franchise, which has yet to recapture the original Harry Potter’s magic.  It doesn’t mean that fantasy as a blockbuster genre is doomed—again: look at Thrones—just that the projects haven’t been able to match the lofty ambitions and production costs. Indeed, while Mortal Engines’ traction cities and broader world-building is undeniably original, the worst thing about the movie is how transparently its narrative tries to imitate great material that came before it. There are the obvious Mad Max undertones to that opening city chase scene—the sequence is even scored by the same composer as Mad Max: Fury Road, Junkie XL—but also elements of The Matrix in certain characters’ aesthetics, and a derivative romantic subplot that all young adult–leaning dystopian fare seems to lean toward. One of the biggest “twists” in the film is taken directly from the original Star Wars trilogy, and almost uses the dialogue verbatim.  In other words: Mortal Engines is, at times, an absolute blast to watch, but its narrative pitfalls also make it clear that the world didn’t just commit blasphemy and allow the true successor to Lord of the Rings to bomb at the box office. There are enough entertaining moments in Mortal Engines to imagine it could gain a second life as a cult classic—I could watch that opening city chase scene at least two dozen more times on Blu-Ray—much like Valerian, a flawed but admirably ambitious space epic, should eventually find a larger, more appreciative audience. But perhaps this soft spot for flawed works like Mortal Engines and Valerian is symptomatic of a larger cinematic trend: They just don’t make blockbusters like these with much frequency anymore. If a few more expensive, unfamiliar projects bomb like these two have, such films may well go extinct. And if that happens, the film and others like it will be like the Minions were in Mortal Engines, relics of an earlier era in Hollywood. Rachel and Callie discuss the Bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes. Then, Jodi hops on to talk ‘The Valley’ and ‘Vanderpump Rules.’"
"Dec 17, 2018",negative," On paper, Aquaman would appear to have so many things going for it. Dazzling underwater visual effects that pit seahorse-borne armies against shark-mounted cavalry, more trident fights than you can shake, er… a trident at, and Nicole Kidman in a home-made lobster costume. What’s not to like? Well, unfortunately for the latest instalment of the so-called DC Extended Universe of superheroes, quite a lot. The story-telling is all over the place, its 140-minute running time feels interminable, and much of the acting is downright poor.  Mind you, with lots of the dialogue delivered through a sort of ‘blub, blub, blub’ filter to show it’s being delivered underwater, even Judi Dench (no, of course, she’s not in it) might struggle for dramatic impact. With director James Wan clearly aiming for the same sort of tongue-in-cheek comic tone that has made Thor such a popular character for DC’s rival, Marvel, it soon becomes clear that Jason Momoa, the Hawaiian-born hunk who plays Aquaman, is no Chris Hemsworth.  At some moments, Momoa seems to have stumbled out of a shampoo commercial, while at others he falls back on his own personal variation on the Blue Steel pout from the male model spoof, Zoolander. After the 2017 triumph that was Wonder Woman, the previous origins story in the DC series, Aquaman has to go down as a distinctly soggy disappointment. So what’s going on? Frankly, too much. First, we have to get used to the idea that Arthur Curry (aka Aquaman when he’s grown-up, who can breathe while submerged and is strong enough to toss a nuclear submarine out of the water) is the product of a storm-tossed union between a Maine lighthouse-keeper and the runaway Queen of Atlantis (Kidman, channelling Daryl Hannah in Splash!).  Also, the wicked King Orm (Patrick Wilson) not only turns out to be Arthur’s half-brother but announces his menacing plan to unite the seven underwater kingdoms. Possibly not peacefully. Which, if I’ve got this even vaguely right, would make him Master of the Oceans and give him the sort of marine military mandate to come after us surface-dwellers next. What’s he so cross with us about? Well, judging by the battleships and garbage tossed on to our beaches in a huge Poseidon-like tempest, it’s the militarisation of the seas and our dumping of rubbish in the oceans. In other words, Orm is doing bad things for good reasons. Which would explain why I was soon as confused as Wilson often looks. Compared to Wonder Woman, Aquaman feels underpowered in every department except visual effects. Acting-wise, Gal Gadot, the Israeli actress who played the title character, was less well known than Momoa is now but not only did she emerge with great personal credit but she was cleverly and sensibly surrounded by actors who gave the production real substance – Chris Pine, Robin Wright and Danny Huston to name but three. Aquaman, by distinct contrast, has Amber Heard in a red wig, sparkly green jumpsuit and glowy eyes as the flighty but useful- to-have-on-your-side Queen of the Sea, Mera, and that’s about it. Oh, and Kidman in that lobster suit, of course, although hers is but a modest contribution. Yahya Abdul Mateen, who plays Mamba, couldn't swim so kept it a secret while he learned - only to find his scenes would be CGI. Script-wise, Wonder Woman also comes out on top, thanks to its sensitive and sophisticated handling of the First World War, a highly emotive subject that could so easily have tripped it up. The polluting of the oceans offers similar emotional potential for Aquaman but it’s not realised, partly because of the confused story-telling, partly because it feels like it’s been lazily chucked in for easy topicality, and partly because a lot of the time Momoa makes Arthur a rather charmless joker who seems keener on looking cool and trying to make us laugh (often in vain) than saving the planet. But maybe he’s keeping that for Aquaman 2. Listen out for a splendidly cast-against-type Julie Andrews as the voice of an ancient sea-monster, a rare moment of fun from Wan, perhaps best known for Fast & Furious 7.  He imbues Aquaman with a similar hyper-kinetic energy and lack of subtlety, demonstrating an impressive mastery of visual effects but surely misjudging the level of acceptable violence for a film clearly seeking a family audience. Produced by Peter Jackson and with a screenplay by the writing team behind The Lord Of The Rings, this spectacular-looking adaptation of Philip Reeve’s 2001 fantasy novel should be one of the highlights of the festive cinema season. But it falls horribly flat, hampered by duff casting, a clumsily structured screenplay and too many reminders of Star Wars. Somewhere, there’s the story of young rebel Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar, right) wanting to kill London’s scheming head-honcho, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). But it all gets lost in a way that means that if you didn’t know visual-effects expert Christian Rivers was directing his first feature film, you could probably guess. Nothing to do with the latest films with Tom Holland as Peter Parker, this is a superbly animated picture that takes Spider-Man right back to his comic-book origins. Which it does by positing the idea that every alternate universe has its own Spider-Man, or does until a huge machine built by the sinister Kingpin blows a hole in the space-time continuum, universes collide and all sorts of versions of the character arrive in the same place. The end result should delight die-hard fans but, at almost two hours, will test less devoted admirers. After Disobedience comes another tale of illicit lesbian love. Only this one is based on a true story that unfolds in the Massachusetts of 1892 and involves a double murder. Chloë Sevigny and Kristen Stewart star in a drama that proves slow and austere until the blood-spattered last lap. Told through the eyes of sadistic, misogynistic serial killer Jack (Matt Dillon), this is a clever, shocking and darkly funny horror movie – until Danish film-maker Lars von Trier eventually goes too far for mainstream audiences… as he nearly always does. "
"Dec 17, 2018",neutral," The post-apocalyptic young adult fantasy flick “Mortal Engines” rolls into and out of one’s consciousness like “traction cities” that roam its landscape. There are so many aviation goggles and large gears grinding that it’s basically “Steampunk: The Movie.” It starts out at a very high level of steampunk, then manages to go up even from there. We’ve got “old tech” and waistcoats a-plenty, hot air balloon cities galore. Bowler-hatted royal guards? We’ve got 20. But who cares, no big deal, there’s a whole lot more. The “Lord of the Rings” team of Peter Jackson , Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have tackled Philip Reeve’s 2001 book of the same name, with director Christian Rivers making his directorial debut. There’s not much setup for the dystopian future. Except there was a “Sixty Minute War,” the Earth’s crust was somehow shattered into thousands of pieces thanks to some kind of nuclear-type weapon called a Medusa, and now all the cities and towns of the world sit atop giant tractor treads, traveling around and eating other smaller towns for “resources” as their citizens hoot and cheer. “Mortal Engines” asks you to just go with it, so, yeah, we’ll just go with it. Rivers has been working in the art and visual effects departments with Jackson and Co. since “Dead Alive” in 1992, and his sense of visual acumen is extraordinarily imaginative and huge in scope. The designs of the cities and their inner workings are remarkable, with a sense of industrial beauty. London, a big, brutish thing with St. Paul’s Cathedral sitting on top like a little hat, motors hither and yon, munching up tiny Bavarian mining villages while its dapper residents maintain museums filled with artifacts of the ancient times, like toasters and smartphones. Puckish museum assistant Tom (Robert Sheehan) has his world thrown topsy-turvy, literally, when he’s tossed into a giant waste tube with Hester (Hera Hilmar), a mysterious girl. She makes a dramatic attempt on the life of Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), London’s most powerful energy tycoon. Tom, who’s never been off London, is caught up in Hester’s quest for vengeance, as well as her escape from a killer robot skeleton named Strike. The pair are scooped up by anti-traction activist Anna Fang (Jihae) and enlisted into the resistance, housed in a city in the sky made up of biplanes, balloons and rickety scaffolding. The sheer size and beauty of “Mortal Engines” is transporting. Even the predatory London is high-tech and well-dressed. And Anna’s crimson plane, seemingly crafted from wood and paper, is jaw-dropping. There is so much that’s pleasing to look at, from the costumes to the characters, to the sets and landscape. It’s hard to imagine the execution, with a near-seamless blend of practical sets and computer-generated spectacle. One just wishes the same level craft went into the characters and script. There’s not a lot of stake in the outcomes of any of the characters, and the script is laden with clichéd old chestnuts that start to get as rusty as the crunchy engines. The only real lessons seem to be “don’t do war” and “robots have feelings, too” (a strange tangent). Visually, it’s busy, hefty and propulsive, but emotionally and thematically, it’s as light as air. These engines could have used a bit more in the tank."
"Dec 17, 2018",positive," The world has been forever broken after an apocalyptic event: cities uprooted and placed on wheels to traverse what remains while trying to be the dominant force and survive. Hugo Weaving is a villain (again) bent on conquering whatever gets in his way and Peter Jackson is yet again attached to a visually impressive and lengthy film. Throw in a few references to a certain classic sci-fi film saga and you have Mortal Engines. The film, which is based on the Phillip Reeve novel from 2001 of the same name, doesn’t pull any punches in its first act. Some novel adaptations give the audience a chance to wade into the story while slowly giving them key bits of information that will come in handy later on. Mortal Engines decides that either you’ve read the novel and know all the information already, or you don’t and you’re about to have a confusing half hour of character introductions and history that you won’t fully comprehend until you’re leaving the theater. The story begins with a mysterious young woman named Hester Shaw aboard a small city that is being hunted by the massive city of London. The exciting chase ends as London captures the smaller city and takes aboard all of the citizens residing on it. As these new members of London are boarded onto the vessel, we are introduced to Thaddeus Valentine (Weaving) who seems to be the most important and intelligent man in London. We then are introduced to several characters, each providing increasingly important plot details about what led to the world crumbling and turning into this Mad Max -like state. After an assassination attempt by Shaw on Valentine goes horribly wrong, Shaw and a young history fanatic named Tom are ejected from the city and thrust into the wastelands left behind. Everything that happens in this first section of the story, although it may be a lot to take in at the time, is explained throughout the rest of the film. On their journey to expose the growing issue that is London, Hester and Tom meet new allies, troubling old acquaintances, and important figures who possess knowledge of the past. There is so much more to this story, which made the slightly over two-hour run-time feel packed with excitement and information. This film adaptation of a young adult novel did something that most fail to do; make a Hollywood action movie feel like you’re reading a dense book. Whether this was a good thing or not is a different story entirely. Hera Hilmar gives a strong and impressive performance as the lead in the film. Hugo Weaving yet again delivers as a suave villain that audiences will be rooting against from the moment the film starts but the breakout stars in the film are Robert Sheehan (if you haven’t seen the show Misfits, go watch it now) who played Tom and Jihae who played the badass Anna Fang. Of all the characters in the film, Jihae was infinitely entertaining and could’ve carried her own film. Peter Jackson’s touch is distinct throughout, despite not sitting in the directors chair. Having produced and co-write the screenplay, the massive scale and eye-popping visuals that Jackson is known for are apparent from the very first scene to the final shot. Although it is primarily a special effects driven film (oftentimes rough around the edges), there were a surprising amount of practical sets that looked fantastic. The film was directed by Christian Rivers, someone who worked in the art department for several of Jackson’s films including The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. The combination of Jackson and Rivers in Mortal Engines showed off the pair’s attention to detail and love of epic landscapes. The biggest aspect of the film that felt the most out of place was its excessive need to throw strange nods and winks at the audience. The story takes place in the distant future after the world and civilization have ended. The characters in the film find and collect relics from the past and use them to crack jokes about the past (our current time). There’s mentions of smartphones, junk food, and the internet that for the most part are glaringly obvious and juvenile. Mortal Engines is for the most part exactly what it looks like from the marketing. It has crazy visuals, epic battle scenes, an impressively massive scale, and a mostly predictable story. While trying to get as much character and history information out as possible, the film struggles at times to find its focus. Regardless, the beautiful scenery and extended action sequences left little room for boredom and made for an entertaining ride. Tyler considers himself to be a true lover of movies and the magic that goes into making them. He spends most of his free time watching and absorbing film and television. From a very young age, film was an escape and an adventure that Tyler could never get enough of. Throughout his high school years he had the honor of working on an award winning independent short film, hosting a film reviewing segment on a public access station, working at two movie theaters, and attending a film festival as a young journalist for his cousin’s local paper. He is the one person that would never turn down going to a theater or staying home and watching a movie and talking about it immediately after. Tyler’s goal in life is to one day be one of the great writers and directors of the entertainment industry like his hero Steven Spielberg."
"Dec 17, 2018",negative," Christian Rivers’s film is based on the first in a quartet of young-adult novels by Philip Reeve. They are driven by a potent conceit: on our ruined earth, in the far future, most cities are on the move. London, for instance, plows across Europe on caterpillar tracks, chewing up smaller towns in its path. Unfortunately, what felt so ominous on the page ends up onscreen looking implausible and sounding merely noisy. Nor are the characters much more engaging—a shame and a surprise, given that Peter Jackson is one of the producers. A comely youth named Tom (Robert Sheehan) teams up with Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), a scarred young woman bent on private vengeance. Their enemy is Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), who is developing a weapon so secret that he houses it in the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. The stakes are enormous, but the outcome is neither here nor there. (In wide release.)"
"Dec 16, 2018",negative," Mortal Engines, or The Peter Jackson Steampunk Movie, as I’ve been calling it, adapts the first in Philip Reeve’s four-part YA fantasy series, first published in 2001. Produced by Jackson and directed by frequent collaborator Christian Reeves, it’s set in a distant, dystopian future, and goofily imagines the geography of planet Earth rearranged, with mobile “predator cities” such as “London” feasting on rural towns and villages (Howl’s Moving Castle seems a reference point here). London’s captain, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), is covertly building a nuclear weapon inside St Paul’s Cathedral. Orphaned bandit Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) seeks Valentine for personal revenge, aided by historian Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan, curls mercilessly straightened) and sunglasses-wearing outlaw Anna Fang (Korean popstar Jihae). Hester, in turn, is hunted by an undead robot named Shrike (Stephen Lang). The film’s critiques are unimaginative, tutting at how territories attack first in order to consolidate power, as well as the spectacle of war itself, bystanders crowding the balconies of the ship-like city, shrieking as guns and lasers fire at the wastelands below."
"Dec 16, 2018",neutral," Let's be honest, since the first trailers started to emerge, Mortal Engines has seemed to be a film that the studio had no idea how to sell to audiences. Based on the book series by Philip Reeve with a screenplay adapted by Lord of the Rings authors Peter Jackson Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh,  it has suffered from mixed messaging about what kind of film it was and what audience age grouping it was going for.  As it turns out, that's unfortunate, because it is an impressive piece of worldbuilding, and it hits more often than it misses. Set 1,000-ish years after a worldwide nuclear war has ravaged and broken the Earth, the remaining cities have evolved into Traction cities – gigantic self-mobile cities, which are practicing a ""municipal Darwinism,"" by hunting down smaller cities and destroying them and taking their resources and labor forces. So it's really a large part of the Mad Max: Fury Road concept, just rather than war rigs and cars, it's London (yes, really, Londinium itself) which is rolling along, its citizens lining the edges of observation decks while it runs to ground a small Bavarian mining town, grinding it into consumable scrap, harvesting ""old tech"" from it, and absorbing its workforce. No, the vast size and scope of the cities makes no logical sense. But then this should be remembered, it's a fantasy. In the same way that audiences flocked to Stardust, or even Lord of the Rings. It's purely a fantasy world, and plays very much by it's own rules. The acting is fine, the huge action set pieces are good, and you've never really known you needed to see what two cities chasing each other around a broken landscape… until now. Because it's actually really pretty fun. Clocking in just over the two hours mark, the film suffers perhaps more than most in recent memory – it should have either been about 20-25 minutes shorter, or double-down and be a limited series. The world is one that feels like it's been developed, and the mythos almost gets in the way of things with only a few hours to deliver the story. The last 30 minutes does wind up heading dangerously close to CW Network-levels of melodrama and interpersonal connections, and could have used another editing pass. Science Fiction is too often relegated to being a 2nd class citizen amongst the genre world, and everything seems like it's a rehash. Sure, even if Engines isn't one to crow about being a ""science-based film,"" that's fine. It doesn't have to be. Genre fandoms are already entirely over the moon for anything to do with Harry Potter, and there's nothing to be found in Engines which is more outlandish or harder to accept than is running around Hogwarts on a daily basis. Relax, it's fine, and I would love to see it get a good box office run domestically or internationally. Mortal Engines is directed by Christian Rivers and stars Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan, Hugo Weaving, Jihae, Leila George, Ronan Raftery, Patrick Malahide, and Stephan Lang. It runs for two hours and eight minutes and is rated PG-13."
"Dec 16, 2018",positive," 
  FEW films in recent memory have demanded a big screen as much as this high-fantasy adaptation. It compensates for a fairly generic hero story beating at its heart by giving us good mythologising and just being the biggest in the room.
 
  Humanity has all but completely fallen thanks to the Sixty Minute War, in which a series of quantum bombs were set off that left the world a wasteland where resources are scarce. To survive and assert dominance, humankind came up with the idea of making the world’s great cities into mobile machines that traverse the land in perpetual war with one another. The larger cities “absorb” smaller surrounding communities whose on-board societies live hearing stories of, and scavenging old tech (iPhones, computers, toasters) from, a time gone by.
 
  Our hero is an enigmatic young woman named Hester (Hera Hilmar). She boards the almighty London to exact revenge against leader Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), whom she blames for the death of her mother. There she meets wide-eyed Tom (Robert Sheehan) and, after they are forced into the wilderness, band together in a larger fight. The idea of mechanised cities roaming the Earth is a bold concept indeed, and it takes some time to convince. However, it gets there thanks to a nice, tangible sense of world-building (despite its CGI-heavy aesthetic) and an eye-popping epic scale.
 
  The film’s greatest strength is the sheer size of it; these humongous mechanical cities, with ever-moving parts and on ground-shaking wheels, are a sight to behold. It’s a spectacle that does a lot of the heavy-lifting, so to speak, as the quest that propels the story forward leans on the familiar and doesn’t have a great deal of chemistry to speak of between the two leads; Sheehan has a fairly thankless, put-upon role compared to Hilmar’s more action-packed one.
 
  Directed by first-timer Christian Rivers – a former storyboard artist talent nurtured by the film’s long-time developing producer/co-writer Peter Jackson – it also works solidly on its own terms as an escapist yarn propped up by an imaginative and intriguing mythology that feels lived-in and “believable” as far as these things go.
 
  It has flaws to spare, not least an over-reliance on a pedestrian hero arc bolted on to a quite standard adventure story. But it’s fairly rewarding in its sense of immersion in a well-designed world of towering scale that reminds us why the big screen is referred to as such.

"
"Dec 15, 2018",neutral," In a post-apocalyptic wasteland over a thousand years in Earth’s future, “predator cities” run down settlements for precious waning resources, self-contained on massive tractor-treads and giant flywheels with internal factories to “digest” whatever they can find. Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) manages to stow away onto a town devoured by London, putting her within striking distance of Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), a city planner who’s only crime appears to be helping the destitute. The assassination is foiled by Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), a London archeologist from a lower caste and an expert on “the ancient world.” Both Hester and Tom find themselves ejected from London and into the wastelands, forming an uneasy alliance to survive the dangers descending upon them. If it wasn’t enough to notice the studio spending very little in the way of pushing this film, there hasn’t been much buzz beyond the initial trailer release; it almost seemed like this was something coming out next year, not mid-December. How bad could a Peter Jackson-produced science-fiction fantasy film be with Weta Workshop effects backing it? The production design looked insane from the first trailer, but the bevy of one-note characters didn’t inspire much confidence. Will filmgoers be rewarded with delighted surprise plopping down coin in exchange for the intended adventure to come?

The opening sequence of a massive landroving superstructure calling itself London running down and swallowing a city whole while not even slowing down is exhilarating, a promise of incredible things to come… yet the remaining film never again reaches that initial plateau. Setting aside the book series that inspired the film as a reference, the distilled plot unfolds like all three original Star Wars films plucked clean of plot points and rammed into a dystopian YA setting. Worse yet is the tepid main character of Hester played underwhelmingly by newcomer Hera Hilmar, a far cry from the Katniss Everdeens or Tris Priors in this genre. By the end, revealed surprises are no surprises at all and the spectacle feels more like a climatic checklist than anything inspired. Once you notice the first Star Wars reference, even the musical cues in the soundtrack seem familiar. While some characters champion the so-called innocent citizens of London — insert “I have friends on that Death Star” joke here — the airship flown by Anna Fang (Jihae) might as well be named “The Millennium Cardinal.” The moment a cloud city appears, you can already determine its fate long before the mandatory warning signs are shown. From superweapon recharging delays (presumably to give the heroes time to succeed) to drawn-out final confrontations (so villains can monologue), there’s zero emotional impact or investment — only spectacle remains. The production design is impressive and fun at times, especially the pop-culture references to the ancient world aka our world, but like Hugo Weaving’s Valentine, it all seems wishy-washy and lacking commitment. Maybe it’s the extra subplot about Stephen Lang’s Shrike or other characters who abruptly appear for audience approval and acceptance yet no actual purpose or motivation. It could be the character’s themselves, but most of the cast seems entirely bored with everything going on: “What plaything can you offer me today?” The London caste system goes unexplored as a footnote and the Londonites are mostly faceless Empire thugs, from Bobby stormstroopers to uniformed technicians. Where are all the other predator cities? How about Berlin? It’s difficult to paint this as style over substance because it’s not that kind of film, but with so little emphasis on why viewers should care, it’s as meaningful as your average Michael Bay Transformers sequel: big, loud, pretty, and hollow. Mortal Engines is rated PG-13 for sequences of futuristic violence/action and the foolishness of opening Pandora’s box — search your feelings; you know it to be true!"
"Dec 15, 2018",negative,"...then we're introduced to the most fearsome mechanism of all, the groaning monstrosity known as The Script"
"Dec 15, 2018",negative,"Even a rather nifty resurrected warrior (Stephen Lang) can't save this cumbersome, steampunk telling of a powerful London on wheels devouring the rest of Europe and beyond."
"Dec 15, 2018",negative," Steampunk is a fascinating subculture that centres on the convergence of early mechanics and science fiction. Existing in worlds that either are based in or have devolved to the past, these societies are simultaneously progressive and backwards. The machines they control are often awe-inspiring, but civilization has taken several steps back towards the dark ages and pre-connectivity. Still, deep, rich colours occupy the frame and devotion or knowledge of the “old ways” absorbs the characters’ time as they hope to better understand their unsophisticated ancestors. Mortal Engines is based in this world, but someone is combing the past for a more dangerous purpose. Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) lives on a mobile London as almost all cities now exist on wheels, moving over connected land masses in search of sparse resources. He works at a museum dedicated to relics of the past, where he encounters fellow history buff, Katherine Valentine (Leila George). Her father, Thaddeus (Hugo Weaving), is head of a secret project expected to save their scarcely surviving city. When Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) infiltrates London, she exposes a secret Thaddeus does everything to sweep back under the rug. Expelled from the metropolis, Hester shows Tom the world beyond the safety of his home. Young adult fiction typically weaves fantastical tales with young people at its centre and an adult at the helm of a potential disaster. The problem with this genre is what works in writing doesn’t always translate well to film adaptations. Seeing their epic settings on the screen — particularly the giant machines in motion — is impressive, but the desire to be faithful to the narrative often results in drawn out stories that bores all except the devoted fan. The minute details that give the written word realism and vibrancy can seem clunky and superfluous in the big-screen version. When the world is burning and time is of the essence, someone stopping to admire a rack of jackets before choosing the perfect one seems… impractical. It also says a lot when the most compelling characters are in supporting roles, such as Anna Fang (Jihae) and her kickass fighting skills, and Shrike’s (Stephen Lang) otherworldly, intimidating presence. With Peter Jackson and members of the production team from the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series working behind the scenes, this movie had potential. Visually, it delivers on that promise as the unique mobile cities are undeniably striking, from the giant metropolis housing thousands to the smaller nomadic markets to the insect-like vehicle built for two. They also take to the air with makeshift planes and floating safe havens. But at 128 minutes, there’s too much wasted time. If it was tighter and focused on hitting the (obvious) beats to propel the story forward, it’d be a much-improved picture. But as it stands, it dilly-dallies through an already predictable narrative to deliver an awkwardly worded and underwhelming conclusion.  COPYRIGHT © 1998 - 2023 DIGITAL JOURNAL INC.

"Dec 14, 2018",negative," Sometime in the not-so-distant future, humanity is on the brink of extinction. A cataclysmic event led to a worldwide conflict that devastated the planet. People retreat to movable cities of varying scales, most of them small, barely more than a few homes, shops and refineries of one sort or another. But the larger ones, the more massive of these mechanical beasts, they may house countless thousands while also containing the remnants of civilizations that otherwise would have been lost to the sands of time. They feed on the smaller vehicles, utilizing them for fuel while also forcing their former inhabitants to join their society whether they wish to or not. The most lethal of these movable metropolises is London. Currently it is marauding across the remains of Europe, esteemed archeologist and revered city planner Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) mysteriously looking for ancient technological artifacts under the guise of trying to construct a machine capable of powering the city without having to fuel its furnaces with scrap metal and other combustible odds and ends. In reality, he wants to rebuild a weapon capable of opening up resource-filled strongholds protected be massive shield walls no movable city has ever been able to penetrate. Valentine wants to utilize the same sort of device the ancients unleashed that titled the world to the edge of apocalypse, trusting that the citizens of London will either be too stupid, too greedy or too timid to realize what he’s about to do is nothing short of evil. Based upon the best-selling series of science fiction-adventures by author Philip Reeve, if nothing else Mortal Engines boasts one of the most eye-popping, adrenaline-filled opening sequences of any movie I’ve seen in 2018. The directorial debut for veteran King Kong and The Hobbit trilogy special effects artist Christian Rivers, this introductory sequence setting up the primary characters, the world they live in and the gigantic moveable cities on which so much of humanity now lives is something else. It’s a freewheeling, expertly realized visual extravaganza. I was glued to my seat, eager to discover where Reeve and Academy Award-winning screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson (the Lord of the Rings trilogy) were going to take things next, the energetically cohesive way in which they set the stage for all the action to come nothing short of thrilling. Which is exactly why I ended up finding this particular feature to be so frustratingly disappointing. There’s so much to love, so much that held me spellbound, the fact I’m sitting here annoyed that the whole thing never works nearly as well as it by all accounts early on looks as if it is going to has me lingering in a state perilously close to anger. While the story owes a great deal to everything ranging from Flash Gordon, to Japanese anime, to The Hunger Games to – surprise, surprise – Star Wars isn’t much of a shock, that Walsh, Boyens and Jackson seem to be having such a devil of a time juggling all of the various narrative strands considering their success with The Lord of the Rings undeniably is. Key characters are introduced, do something interesting and then subsequently disappear for large chunks of the story only to be reintroduced at random moments. Worse, the climax feels hurried, haphazardly put together and oddly unfocused. Nothing holds together in an emotionally satisfying way, and by the time a few surviving heroes quite literally flew off into the sunset I was honestly flummoxed as to why I was supposed to have cared about anything that just happened throughout the course of this 128-minute endeavor. But gosh darn do I want to care. The way Rivers introduces all his primary characters during that opening sequence, most notably Valentine, his whip-smart daughter Katherine (Leila George) and erstwhile historian and wannabe pilot Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), while also juggling a humongous action sequence that has to explain the nature of these movable cities while at the same time showcase what they can and cannot do, all of that is handled with exhilarating confidence. Best of all is the way in which the filmmaker showcases the story’s primary heroine, the red scarf clad firebrand Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar). Rivers immediately cements her as this film’s most iconic personality, giving just enough information about Hester in these initial moments to enflame my curiosity and get me genuinely excited to discover why she and Valentine are instant enemies right from the first second they entered into one another’s company. So why do some of these characters, most notably Katherine, just up and vanish for long stretches only to reappear at random moments to either help fill in some of the expository holes or do something important when no one else is apparently available to do so? Why is a key subplot involving Hester and a robotic, formerly human bounty hunter named Shrike (a phenomenal Stephen Lang) the most emotional one in the entire film even though there’s another plot strand involving the young woman and her growing infatuation with Tom to contend with as well? Why does the climactic battle between the city of London and a ragtag group of aerial pirates led by the enigmatic Anna Fang (Jihae) feel rushed, confusingly edited and sloppily assembled when everything else up to that point has been so visually resplendent and narratively coherent? These are just some of the issues I had as Mortal Engines roared towards its conclusion. It felt like large chunks were taken out of the film almost as if someone ordered Rivers, Jackson and the rest of the creative team to whittle things down as close to a two-hour running time as possible. As interesting as this world is and as spectacularly realized as much of it might be, at a certain point all of the missteps can’t help but take an almost catastrophic toll. While my eight-year-old self was thrilling to a lot of what was happening, as magnetic and as empowering a pair of heroines Hester and Anna end up proving to be (both Hilmar and Jihae deliver dynamically compelling performances), I still couldn’t get past just how increasingly absurd and disconnected everything became. By the time the key face-off the entire story had been building towards finally came to pass even that turned out to be something of a disheartening letdown, and a moment that should have had me wanting to rise to my feet and cheer instead had me slumping nearer to the floor letting out an inaudible groan. Look, I’m still impressed by much of what Rivers is able to accomplish. This is an intriguing world, and the surviving characters are all ones I’d not be against following on another adventure if it were ever to happen. Also, just from a technical standpoint the visual effects, sound design, costumes and production design are some of the best I’ve seen this year, and had this film screened for press earlier in the month I’d I’ve voted for all of them for awards consideration in the various critic organizations I’m privileged to be a part of. Is it enough for me to give Mortal Engines a recommendation? No, no it is not. But that doesn’t mean there’s still not plenty to love, and if my eight-year-old self has its way that might be enough to give this sci-fi spectacle a second chance sooner rather than later.

"Dec 14, 2018",positive," 
When it comes to fantasy and soft science fiction, the
concept of “world building” is at least as important as narrative and character
development. “World building” refers to the ability of an author or filmmaker
to craft a new and amazing vista in which his/her story can transpire, using every
available tool to achieve the aim of making the setting believable and “lived
in” rather than pedestrian and forgettable. Mortal
Engines, the movie adaptation of Philip Reeve’s YA novel, represents one of
the most impressive examples of “world building” in recent years, surpassing
such contenders as Valerian, Cloud Atlas, and even the recent Star Wars episodes.  Blessed with a well-paced (although sometimes too frenetic)
story that has a beginning, middle, and end, Mortal Engines might have been well-placed to start a new franchise
had outside factors not conspired against it. One of the common gripes with
movies like this – that they sacrifice the “single movie” story concept in
order to facilitate a multi-part arc (that, more often than not, is never given
the opportunity to play out, as fans of Divergent
will attest) – doesn’t apply here. Screenwriters Peter Jackson, Philippa
Boyens, and Fran Walsh, who are no strangers to movie series, ensure that Mortal Engines remains self-contained
while still allowing for the possibility of future installments. (Reeve wrote a
four-book set with these characters.) Unfortunately, the collapse of the YA
motion picture market coupled with Universal’s decision not to aggressively publicize
Mortal Engines, has all-but-assured
that this will be a one-and-done affair. And, while I would enjoy seeing more
adventures with these characters, I left the theater satisfied with the story I
had seen and the “world building” that brings it to life. The time frame is perhaps 1000 years in the future. As a
result of a cataclysmic “60-minute war” that laid waste to the planet, a
steampunk post-apocalyptic future has arisen in which huge, mobile cities roam
the barren landscape looking for smaller settlements to “devour.” The movie
opens with a special effects bonanza as the greatest of all the cities, London,
commanded by Mayor Magnus Crome (Patrick Malahide), chases down the mining settlement
of Salzhaken. Shortly thereafter, one of the refugees from Salzhaken, a young
woman named Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), attempts to assassinate the head of the
Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). The attack is foiled by
one of Valentine’s apprentices, Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), who chases
Hester through the burning wreckage of Salzhaken as London consumes it for energy.
The chase ends with both Hester and Tom being ejected from the ship when Valentine
reveals himself not to be the genial, unassuming man he seems to be. Out in the
Great Hunting Ground, Hester and Tom face a number of challenges, not the least
of which is learning to trust one another. They join forces with Anti-Traction
League agent Anna Fang (Jihae) in an attempt to stop Valentine before he is
able to make a death-weapon active. And Hester becomes the focal point of a
hunt by the undead Stalker Shrike (Stephen Lang), who claims she has broken a
promise. If Mortal Engines
seems at times like Star Wars, it’s
not a coincidence. But that’s not because Reeve and the screenwriters were
overly influenced by George Lucas’ movies (although it would be naïve to assume
there’s not some of that) but because, as has often been discussed when analyzing
Lucas’ storytelling, common tropes and mythologies form the basis not only of Star Wars but many epic stories. The
film’s look, shaped under the direction of fist-time director (and Jackson protégé)
Christian Rivers, draws on various familiar steampunk sources from Mad Max to The City of Lost Children to a few of Terry Gilliam’s adventures,
while maintaining its own identity. The special effects are indeed special and
deserve to be seen on a big screen (the bigger, the better). This is one of
those rare films when wall-to-wall CGI doesn’t result in an overdose.  For the lead, the filmmakers went with Icelandic actress Hera
Himlar, who has quietly assembled an impressive (albeit low-key) resume in
recent years. She conveys Hester’s strength, isolation, and vulnerability and
generates some slow-burn chemistry with Robert Sheehan’s bumbling Tom. Sheehan,
like Himlar, is a relatively fresh face, although this isn’t his first
flirtation with YA movies. (He previously appeared in the ill-fated City of Bones.) The best-known actor in Mortal Engines is also the one with the
most screen presence: Hugo Weaving, who infuses the villainous Valentine with a
charismatic streak that refuses to be ignored. Weaving, who has a longstanding
relationship with Jackson (he portrayed Elrond in the Middle Earth movies), makes
Valentine likable enough that he seems more like an anti-hero than a
traditional bad guy. (One could envision a different version of this movie from
his perspective.) It’s increasingly rare that new properties are accorded this
sort of big, splashy treatment. In today’s climate, nearly every spectacle is
either a sequel or a remake. Mortal
Engines isn’t revolutionary nor does it “color outside the lines” in terms
of its narrative or character interaction. But it succeeds in telling an
engaging tale with sufficient flare and drive that it never threatens to
overstay its welcome. As shepherded by filmmakers with a penchant for visual
storytelling, Mortal Engines is two
hours well-spent."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," The notion of cities on tank treads, rolling around and ingesting the landscape in front of them, could function as an apt metaphor for the excesses of the Hollywood franchise machine; endless appetite coupled with voracious recycling. So it should surprise no one that Mortal Engines is such a beast itself. Though based on a 2001 novel by Philip Reeve, this Mad Max steampunk affair gradually steals more and more shots, lines, props, wardrobe and plot points from the first Star Wars trilogy until you’re prepared for someone to draw a lightsaber or head to Mos Eisley. The film is a Peter Jackson production, co-written by Jackson and partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyd, and directed by Hobbit second-unit helmer Christian Rivers. Set a thousand years after something called the “Sixty Minute War” devastated civilization (and presumably Sunday night TV ratings), it features a wheeled City of London rampaging across Europe. Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) is at the helm, but is almost killed by Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), whom he once knew and left with a nasty scar and a tragic backstory. She escapes accompanied by city-dweller Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), who gradually learns that London isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Among other things, Thaddeus is trying to resurrect ancient technology to make his city the fittest player in this game of “municipal Darwinism.” Hester is also being chased by Shrike, an undead robot that you could build yourself with bits of Bill Nighy, a Terminator and some green Christmas lights. But she has a friend in the mysterious Anna Fang, played by ethereal Korean singer-songwriter Jihae. Anna flies her airship – I swear it was called the Jenny Agutter, but Google assures me it’s Jenny Haniver – to Airhaven, a huge floating city that looks like a special effect waiting to happen. The film is gorgeous to look at, particularly in the early-going before you start playing spot-the-Star-Wars reference. At least $18 million of its $100-million budget must have gone toward bric-a-brac, and it would have been amazing to see what a visual director like Terry Gilliam could have done with this overstuffed tale. Alas, Rivers plays it safe, the by-the-numbers script backed by take-you-by-the-hand editing, and a style of shooting I’m going to call cinematobvious. No memory can be recalled without an extended flashback, usually ending with a return to the character now sporting an artful tear on his or her cheek. The title, by the way, comes from a line from Shakespeare’s “Othello.” I’m just glad the filmmakers didn’t get their hands on Dickens.

"Dec 14, 2018",negative,This tale ... is a homemade quilt of repurposed story beats. No character in this film will do something you haven't seen a very similar character do in the past.
"Dec 14, 2018",positive," Only the latest dystopian yarn, “Mortal Engines,” can’t help but pilfer in the third act. Let’s give the filmmakers points for good taste. The finale steals from that “Star Wars” climax in ways both huge and small. The story opens with a bang, the kind that suggest a new classic is in progress. Those hopes are dashes as soon as the rolling tank known as London comes to a halt. We’re roughly a 1,000 years in the future, long after the Sixty Minute War rendered the earth uninhabitable. So the remaining humans made their cities portable via massive gears, wheels and machinery. That sparks the phenomenal opening, a set piece delivering thrills, imaginative visuals and a wonderful sense of scale. There’s no follow-up sequence that’s equal to it. What’s worse? The longer “Mortal Engines” rolls on, the less intelligent it comes. “Mortal Engines” reflects Hollywood’s woke sensibilities, but it doesn’t stop the story cold. Tom is depicted as a well-intentioned fool. He’s even called an idiot at one point. Hester, by comparison, is flawless in her fury. The screen still comes alive whenever Anna Fang appears. Jihae plays Anna, a tough as nails hero with a murky backstory. She’s tough and inscrutable, and Jihae pulls it off without posing. The most human character in the story? A zombie robot named Shrike (voiced by Stephen Lang). That’s a bad sign, given the crush of actual humans in the cast. Still, Shrike is so arresting it becomes less a flaw than a selling point. The third act goes by in a blur. Select moments may make you cheer, but it’s so frenzied, and loud, that the impact is duller than you expect. You’ll spot the “Star Wars” nods right away, but you’ll miss that film’s elegant storytelling. Hilmar and Sheehan have chemistry, all right, but the screenplay can’t make the most of it. Weaving can do villainy by default, so there’s little problem with his gravitas quotient. The movie toys with interesting notions but quickly discards them. Why are the Londoners so bloodthirsty? Is the quest for salt all that important? Are there other threats to London’s traction city? “Mortal Engines,” based on a young adult novel, discourages deeper thought. That’s a shame given its dystopian roots. Half their fun is teasing out their cock-eyed scenarios."
"Dec 14, 2018",positive," Copyright Universal 2018Well, it looks amazing. Producer Peter Jackson has brought the same artistic vision to “Mortal Engines” that he did to the “Lord of the Rings” films. But this time the visual splendor is just too sharp a contrast with a story that is a long, long way from the deeply imagined world of Tolkien. It is based on a seven (so far) series of books by Philip Reeve about a post-apocalyptic world in which cities roll around on enormous, ravenous monster steampunk vehicles. The vehicles are pretty cool. The story is not. It’s just another derivative post-apocalyptic story about utter catastrophe and corruption, where the only hope is a small group of hot teenagers, a lesser “Hunger Games/Divergent/Maze Runner/Ender’s Game” knock-off, with a touch of “Battlefield Earth,” “Terminator,” and even a hint of the original “Star Wars” trilogy (now episodes IV and V). We’re informed at the beginning that it took just an hour to destroy life as we know it, literally, geographically remaking the map of the world, with super-weapons that shattered the surface of the planet. Humanity has reverted to survival of the fittest, which means that there is only a very thin veneer of any kind of social structure beyond “might makes right.” London is might, and in the opening scene we see the London literal ship of state take over a smaller city/vehicle absorbing its resources, including its residents, who are “welcomed” by being turned into slave labor. That thin veneer includes some superficial trappings of the civilization that preceded it, including “historians” who operate a “museum,” where they try to parse the meaning of the shards of 21st century life, especially the technology as it appears written records did not survive. But we will learn that the real reason for this supposed interest in the past is to get access to the very same weapons that caused the disaster. Santayana said that those who do not study history are condemned to repeat it. In this case, the only history that is studied is by those who intend to repeat it. The real star of the film is production designer Dan Hennah. The machinery is wonderfully intricate and detailed. The settings are so gorgeously done that they just point up the under-imagined quality of the script, which is basically: A rebel girl with a scar on her face (Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw) and a “historian” from the museum (Robert Sheehan as Tom Natsworthy) are on the run from the evil Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), who killed Hester’s mother and tried to kill Tom. He is the one whose interest in the museum’s artifacts was just a cover for tracking down all the missing pieces to reconstruct the big blaster, but he has a nice blonde daughter named Katherine (Leila George) who gets to find out that her father has been lying to her about pretty much everything. Hester and Tom are also on the run from a Terminator-type cyborg/zombie who was once a man but is now a single-minded killing machine (Stephen Lang, warming up for “Avatar” sequels or maybe cooling down from them.  Some books are fine as they are. Some are untranslatable to the screen, and some, like this one, should stay between the covers because bringing them to life only shows how lifeless they are. Parents should  know that this movie includes intense and sometimes graphic peril and violence, murder, explosions, knives, guns, bombs, characters injured and killed including parents, and some disturbing images."
"Dec 14, 2018",positive," The movie, directed by Christian Rivers, is visually stunning. The team of screenwriters — Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson — proved with ""The Lord of the Rings"" they can do epic films well, and this big-budget picture is no exception. The world has been ruined by a “60-minute war” that took out much of civilization, but the stark landscape makes for an interesting backdrop as you watch the main characters run for their lives. The giant, steampunk contraption that London has become rolls along, consuming other cities in its path. It is a fascinating blend of old technology and modern ideas. The ideas of territory and borders have become obsolete as London rumbles across the Earth in search of resources. You can ponder the meaning of civilization and how people treat each other in a society where people who are relegated to the lower rungs of society are literally kept underground. And if you like action, the movie delivers fight and chase scenes in abundance. The actress Jihae (from the television series ""Mars"") has a couple of thrilling fight scenes as Anna Fang, as does newcomer Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw.  For example, much of the plot revolves around a city lacking technology and resources, but there are fantastic flying machines that seem to have plenty of power and advanced weaponry. Maybe some of those questions are answered in the 2001 Philip Reeves novel of the same name upon which the film is based. But even at two hours and eight minutes, the film doesn't have time to tie up all of its loose ends, or maybe it doesn't mean to. ""Mortal Engines"" is an entertaining movie if you don’t ask to many questions of the story and stick to what’s put in front of you onscreen."
"Dec 14, 2018",positive,"Part buddy movie, part origin, part legend setting - Mortal Engines has a lot to like about it, but Jeepers it really packs far too much in."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," A loopy combination of superhero movie, Bond film, the legend of King Arthur, David Attenborough's Blue Planet and for those old enough to recall ITV's World Of Sport, the Saturday afternoon wrestling from Brent Town Hall, Aquaman is like the weirdest dream you will ever have. It begins with Nicole Kidman, looking even more airbrushed than she did the other week on Graham Norton's sofa, washing up on some rocks next to a lighthouse. She duly settles down to a life of domestic bliss with Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison), the lighthouse keeper, and soon they have a son, Arthur.  He grows up to become the kind of hairy tattooed hunk who, had he not been heir to the mighty underwater realm of Atlantis, might well have ended up grappling with Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy on World Of Sport. Arthur, as if you need telling, is otherwise known as Aquaman, and this sixth instalment of the so-called DC Extended Universe is the first time he has carried a movie on his own. He is played by Jason Momoa, who could probably carry a Range Rover on his own. Momoa was even born in Hawaii, for heaven's sake, and looks as if he has been waiting all his life to be cast as Aquaman.  By the time Arthur/Aquaman reaches maturity — and boy, what maturity! — his mother has left the lighthouse and returned to look after her deep-sea interests. But there's a brouhaha brewing in the briny. He is a peroxided rotter called Orm (Patrick Wilson), who is in league with a grumpy king called Nereus (Dolph Lundgren). Orm is determined to unite the seven underwater kingdoms and declare war on the 'surface world'. But, contrary to the advice of his vizier Vulko (Willem Dafoe, no less), he is bent on war as revenge on humanity for polluting the oceans. That doesn't sound entirely unreasonable if you're half-man, half-fish, but Aquaman can't let him wreak havoc, and predictably needs only a sacred trident (guarded, even more predictably, by a fearsome sea monster) to stop him. All this is stretched out to well over two hours, but it's easy enough to see why director James Wan was swept away on a tide of his own ambition. After all, why not have an entirely pointless but impressively filmic excursion to the Sahara desert, if your whopping budget (a reported $200 million) extends to it?  And there are some truly exhilarating action sequences, including a chase across the terracotta roofs of a picturesque Italian town that looks rather like Wan's audition to direct a Bond film. Atlantis, too, is gorgeously realised. If Las Vegas remodelled by Donald Trump were plunged underwater, and we live in hope, this is what it might look like. The script, by Will Beall and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, works hard on the jokey banter between her and Aquaman, and for that matter between Aquaman and everyone else, which in truth feels a little forced, like a DC movie trying to emulate a Marvel movie. But there is plenty here to admire and enjoy. Too much, really. Mortal Engines is another crazy fantasy, set well over a thousand years in the future. It is based on Philip Reeve's dystopian novel for young adults about cities that come to life and eat each other, in a bonkers expression of 'municipal Darwinism'. First on the menu in this 'age of the great predator cities of the west' is a small Bavarian mining town, which presumably tastes of bratwurst, and is gobbled up by a voraciously greedy London. The former is Hester Shaw (Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar), an orphan scarred both figuratively and literally by life, and more especially by evil Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), a twisted archaeologist who also murdered her mother. The story chronicles Hester's tireless quest for revenge, but to believe in it, you have also to believe in the notion of 'traction cities' and 'static cities' being pitched against one another in mortal combat. And I didn't, frankly. Still, the involvement of Lord Of The Rings director Peter Jackson, who was co-writer and producer, helps to explain the grandeur of some of the special effects, and the outlandish design choices, which have the law-enforcers of the far-off future dressed like Victorian policemen. Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is another disappointment, a monumentally long Marvel animation which is at least 30 per cent less witty than everyone involved seems to think it is. It riffs on the idea that anyone 'lucky' enough to be bitten by a radioactive spider can be Spider-Man — not just Peter Parker — and our upwardly mobile hero is mixed-race schoolboy Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), son of an African-American cop and a Hispanic nurse. A strong voice-cast also includes Hailee Steinfeld as the girl of Miles's dreams, Mahershala Ali as his uncle, Liev Schreiber as his evil nemesis, and Nicolas Cage as a black-and-white Spider-Man from the world of Forties film noir. There are some nice touches — such as a cameo from Spider-Man's creator, the late Stan Lee, in cartoon form — and the actual animation is often wonderful. But if ever a film could be described as being pleased with itself, this is it. At only a whisker under two hours, it feels like an endurance test long before the end. More than 125 years since she (allegedly) slaughtered her father and stepmother with an axe, Lizzie Borden remains one of America's most notorious killers. On this side of the Atlantic, however, I'm not sure how much is really known about her. Lizzie fills in some of the gaps in our knowledge, but somewhat prejudicially, in that it depicts its title character as a woman quite understandably driven to the end of her tether.  Chloe Sevigny plays Lizzie, and Kristen Stewart the family's Irish maid, Bridget. The empathy between the pair grows and even becomes sexual, as they are driven together by their loathing of Lizzie's rich, tyrannical father (Jamey Sheridan). A controlling, joyless bully, he presides over an utterly wretched New England household filled with women who fear him, though Lizzie is the only one who dares defy him. The Borden menfolk (not just Lizzie's father, but also his brother) are irredeemably nasty, almost panto-like in their villainy, while the women are all depicted as victims, even though Lizzie is given good reason to hate her stepmother (Fiona Shaw). Of course, there is hatred, and there is savage murder. The film presents the latter as a downright reasonable consequence of the former, to the extent — spoiler alert for readers outside the United States — that it feels like a relief when Lizzie is acquitted. Whether all this is an accurate telling of the Lizzie Borden story I'm not sure, and I don't suppose the filmmakers can be sure either.  But as a depiction of stuffy New England society in 1892, and of a crime that belonged very much to its time and place, it's worth seeing. From the miserable past to an even more miserable future, the Netflix film Bird Box is set in a post-apocalyptic America where something is compelling people to kill themselves. If they don't see it, whatever it is, then they stay alive. Sandra Bullock leads a decent cast, which also includes John Malkovich and Tom Hollander, but this horror-thriller is rarely scary and only fitfully suspenseful, largely because the being behind all this malevolence is never seen by us, either. Despite Bullock's best efforts as, blindfolded and shrieking ominous warnings, her character rows two young children down a mist-shrouded river, it all becomes just a little bit silly, puncturing the suspense altogether. "
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," In the future, Minions™ will be precious relics and cities will exist on large moving vehicles. The postapocalyptic dress code will be steampunk, and the human race will have evolved past war and weapons and desperate bids for power. Because as we learn very quickly, Mortal Engines is a story that deals largely in secrets. To start, we don’t know why Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) desperately wants to kill London-based archeologist Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). Then, we don’t know why Thaddeus has such a vendetta against Hester’s late mother. We also don’t know anything about Anna Fang (Jihae), a rebel with a price on her head for (I think) rallying against the existing city systems, and we certainly don’t know why a zombie robot is so thirsty for Hester’s blood that he’ll kill anyone who stands in his way. Just kidding. Based on the 2001 book series by Philip Reeve, Mortal Engines mistakenly swaps out slow-burning revelations for explanations that come fast and furious and with no time to digest them. Which is actually understandable: Within the first 10 minutes alone, we meet nearly a dozen characters who seem to have relevance, but then fail to appear on-screen long enough for us to develop our own feelings for them.  We know we should cheer for Hester, and we know we should want her to have a relationship with fellow outcast Tom (Robert Sheehan) – much like we should feel sympathy for Katherine Valentine (Leila George), who slowly comes to realize her father, Thaddeus, is a weapons-obsessive megalomaniac. But it’s impossible: Just when director Christian Rivers begins to set up a backstory that would help us glean a little more insight into members of the movie’s motley crew, we’re yanked away into another subplot where once again, we’re forced to figure out who’s who, why and whether we should even bother to let them in. So, by the hour mark, you just … don’t. Especially since instead of gingerly peeling back story layers or character traits, memories are delivered via flashbacks, montages and a-ha moments. (Which – and not to spoil anything, but for the record – is the least effective way to make anybody emotional over an angry zombie-robot.) Of course, you can’t expect a lot more if you’re packing so much plot into a two-hour movie. (Especially if you don’t have a multipicture deal that would provide more time to develop characters. Seriously: Imagine packing three Harry Potter books into one of the shortest movies and then just expecting everyone to understand Voldemort’s intentions.) And it’s a testimony to the acting of Hilmar and Jihae that despite us knowing next to nothing about their characters, they still make us care enough to hope they don’t die. But unfortunately, that isn’t enough, because while a handful of characters do seem interesting enough to justify zooming in on their pasts and realities (here’s me petitioning for a stand-alone movie about Anna Fang), the dozens of others we meet make Mortal Engines feel like a catwalk of character tropes we’ve seen presented better, elsewhere. Which isn’t fair to anybody: not the audience, not fans of the franchise and certainly not to the actors who, despite lacklustre dialogue and character development, genuinely seem to be trying their best. What’s ironic (and frustrating) is that in an era defined by a constant feeling of doom, a story that could actually capitalize on it makes us feel that way only when we all realize it’s been nearly an hour in to the story and we’re still meeting new characters."
"Dec 14, 2018",positive,"I do admire its ambition, sense of scale, and appealing main cast. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," I don't want to say the new Mortal Engines is a witless classic along the lines of those films. It has some energy and some memorable images. If only it had more of those things, and less of all the clutter and noise that otherwise distinguish it. This is not a Peter Jackson movie, if that's what you may have thought. It's a Peter Jackson-adjacent movie, adapted by the hobbity auteur and his longtime collaborators, Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens, from a fantasy novel—the first in a series of four—by Philip Reeve. The project was then passed off to Jackson protégé Christian Rivers, who won an Oscar for the effects work on his mentor's 2005 King Kong and is here presenting us with his first feature. He is a master of digital animation, for sure—although by the time this movie shuffles past the two-hour mark, you're not likely to care much about that anymore. The story, which is rather complicated and heavily bedecked with exposition, is set in yet another of those post-apocalyptic dystopias that looks like 200 miles of bad road stretched out under a blazing outland sun (we're in New Zealand, of course). This is all that's left after a ""Sixty Minute War"" trashed the planet 1100 years ago. In the centuries since then, humankind has somehow (but how?) managed to take whole major cities—London is the ""traction city"" we're concerned with here—and mount them on tank treads and then drive them around the dismal flatlands in search of other cities to eat. Or, more precisely, to suck into huge mechanical maws and strip of their assets. (""Old tech"" is especially prized, particularly ""weapons grade,"" although ancient broken toasters and cracked iPhones are also happily scarfed up and set out for display in the British Museum—which is of course right on board). Apart from Jackson regular Hugo Weaving—here playing Thaddeus Valentine, a science bigwig who conducts mysterious experiments in St. Paul's Cathedral, high atop the giant London-mobile—the rest of the cast is relatively little-known. Which is okay, since most of the characters they play are shuffled around so briskly they have virtually no room to register. Valentine has a bland daughter on whom he dotes (Leila George), but she and her boyfriend/buddy/whatever, the oddly monikered Bevis Pod (Ronan Raftery), are pure pudding, and offer little support for the movie's central couple, an obscurely motivated young interloper named Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and annoyingly puppylike museum historian Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan). Hilmar, whose character is intent on killing Valentine for some reason, has a fresh, spunky energy; but Sheehan is a young actor of very little charisma, which leaves a large hole at the center of the movie. Fortunately, there are two memorable characters. One is a towering robo-killer called Shrike (an unrecognizable Stephen Lang), who has a bizarre and long-running relationship with Hester and in the end brings some unexpected heart to the proceedings. The other is an exotic air pirate named Anna Fang (South Korean pop musician Jihae), who in her zero-cool shades and the fabulous crimson plane she docks at a hovering sky city, strongly recalls the 2004 sci-fi mini-classic Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (a movie I'd recommend before recommending this one). As a work of action filmmaking, the picture isn't a lot more than the sum of its appropriations: the Mad Max overtones, the Miyazaki echoes, the Star Wars references all over the place. It's also over-stuffed with instructional dialogue. Contemplating Earth's golden-age civilization of yore and its present-day ruin, one character says, ""How can a society so advanced be so stupid?"" Says another, ""What have we done?"" Says a third, possibly confused, ""We should never have gone to Europe."" Start your day with Reason.

"Dec 14, 2018",neutral," As the years go on, the comparisons between Peter Jackson and George Lucas only grow more and more apparent. After each bringing to the screen iconic film trilogies that defined their generations, both filmmakers have failed to live up to their legacies. They both eventually put out prequels to their beloved films to controversial results, and have mostly spent their time since producing for others and pushing new filmmaking technology; remember 48-frames-per-second, anyone? But after a brief hiatus, Jackson is back and making another attempt at adapting a high concept novel to the screen. Producing and co-writing the film (with Christian Rivers in his feature directorial debut after working in storyboarding and pre-vis on many of Jackson’s pictures), Mortal Engines is a chance for Jackson to prove he still has a worthwhile post-Lord of the Rings career. The result? A resounding “…meh?” Having not read the book series by Phillip Reeve, I can only judge Mortal Engines as a film rather than an adaptation, but I can understand why the novel was popular and had great potential for a movie just from watching. I say “potential” because Mortal Engines never seems to get its own engine revving efficiently. Whilst the story world itself is respectfully imaginative, the story and characters are functional at best. If you’ve heard at least one fantasy adventure plot in your life, Mortal Engines will sound eerily familiar, whilst fans of the genre should be able to calculate every plot turn beat for beat. Normally, interesting characters would compensate for this and add unique flair to differentiate itself from its contemporaries, but they are just as perfunctory as the narrative. Everything can just be summed up as “it’s fine”. The story is structured and paced decently, there’s no embarrassing dialogue or ridiculously out-of-field plot turns, and it smartly doesn’t sequel-bait and remains a functional self-contained story. There’s nothing in Mortal Engines that flat-out doesn’t work, but not being bad doesn’t equal being good. It just means it’s unremarkable, and I should not be saying that about a post-apocalyptic steampunk adventure that features a cockroach-mobile and a zombie cyborg. If there is anything to say is at fault, I believe it’s that the movie just takes itself too seriously. There is an inkling of humour and even some socio-political satire to the text, but everything is presented so matter-of-factly that it just falls flat. If the film at least had a good sense of humour about itself, it would have been easier to forgive its reliance on tropes. Casting a big-budget movie without many recognisable stars is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows the actors to better assimilate into their characters, making the world more believable to an audience instead of pulling them out of it because they recognise so-and-so from some gossip rag. On the other hand, it means you lose a major selling point when you don’t have something to attract an unfamiliar audience in, and it especially doesn’t work when the actors you have cast aren’t particularly compelling. Hera Hilmar does a decent enough job as protagonist Hester Shaw, avoiding typical YA heroine tropes by giving her a more embittered anti-hero streak, but her performance doesn’t grow in line with her character. Even after learning more of her backstory and seeing her grow to be more trusting and heroic, she remains too impenetrable to fully embrace her as our protagonist, and Hilmar’s stoic performance shoulders a lot of that blame. Robert Sheehan doesn’t exactly help either as Tom Natsworthy, playing the “nebbish sidekick who learns heroism through adversity and also falls for the badass lady who saves him constantly despite saying she doesn’t care about him just as constantly but who still falls for him too anyway” so rigidly to the script that you can predict his arc right from his first scene. Jihae is just as plagued by blandness as rebel leader Anna Fang, whilst Leila George and Ronan Raftery linger in an underdeveloped subplot that only exists to provide further exposition to the villain’s plot. Speaking of, are you at all surprised that Hugo Weaving is playing the bad guy in this? Yeah, I didn’t think so. The only character that has anything really going for them is Stephen Lang as the aforementioned zombie cyborg Shrike, with an interesting characterization and a compelling relationship between him and Hester…that the movie quickly squanders just as it gets interesting. I don’t know. Book readers, does this ever become important again in the sequels? Because I would watch the hell out of a movie just about Hester and Shrike. Though it has a similar attention to detail and breadth to its world, Mortal Engines certainly doesn’t try to ape the aesthetic of the Middle-earth movies. Instead, it clearly borrows a lot of inspiration for its design from Studo Ghibli movies, specifically Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Laputa: Castle in the Sky. It’s certainly a well-accomplished spectacle to bring these vibrant and ostentatious designs to live-action, and it only makes we wish this amount of effort were in service of a more interesting story. However, in terms of execution, Mortal Engines is certainly more in The Hobbut camp than Lord of the Rings, mainly down to a similar overuse of CGI that creates a disparate uncanny valley feeling between the live-action and computer-generated elements, and even the elements that are live-action have a warped design sensibility that makes them feel CGI even though they’re not. I’ll be honest here: I saw Mortal Engines only yesterday, and I’m struggling right now to even remember the most basic details. It is just that unmemorable. It certainly isn’t a film made without effort, but only enough to function rather than thrive. In a crowded holiday release schedule, and without a relevant IP or compelling stars to carry it, Jackson’s dwindling clout isn’t anywhere near enough to keep this film afloat amongst more distinctive competition. It honestly feels like a film released about a decade too late; put it out around the same time as The Golden Compass or The Spiderwick Chronicles, and it might have stood a better chance. But in 2018, with so many better releases coming to screens every month and a huge catalogue of past similar films to discover or revisit, Mortal Engines doesn’t deliver anything you couldn’t get better elsewhere."

"Dec 14, 2018",negative," There was a time when post-apocalyptic films roamed the landscape, pillaging better movies for spare parts. That time is now, and that movie is “Mortal Engines,” in which a ravaged Earth’s population now inhabits cities on wheels. “London” is helmed by a scientific striver (Hugo Weaving) obsessed with empire-building. When he’s confronted by a young woman from his past (Hera Hilmar), he’s got it in for her and her accomplice, a renegade historian (Robert Sheehan). There’s some steampunk design to like, plus a Frankenstein’s-monster zombie (Stephen Lang) and the gangster confidence of actress Jihae as a resistance fighter. But most of “Mortal Engines” is a wearying blast of CGI and genre-cribbing (most egregiously, director Christian Rivers hired composer Junkie XL to seemingly lift, wholesale, his soundtrack from “Mad Max: Fury Road”). Then again, as “London” rattles out of “Europe” on a perilous collision course, perhaps screenwriters Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens just meant this as one hilarious Brexit metaphor."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," How did this truly crummy movie get made? I have a theory. Co-producers Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh, who once upon a time could put together a motion picture that was engaging, coherent, entertaining, and even genuinely dazzling, looked at a bag of money that Universal and sundry other sources of capital left on their table and asked themselves, “Can we whiff as badly as the Wachowskis did with ‘Jupiter Ascending,’ only leaving out the fun pansexual campy parts?” And the answer is, absolutely! Glenn Kenny was the chief film critic of Premiere magazine for almost half of its existence. He has written for a host of other publications and resides in Brooklyn.

"Dec 14, 2018",negative,"There are fleeting pleasures to be had here in Brexit-era parallels...but too soon the movie returns to deadening clichés (a doomsday weapon! A plucky band of rebels!), blank-faced performances and truly horrible line-readings."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative,"The coolest thing about this movie is that it's a really imaginative, interesting world. The biggest bummer is that they didn't take that interesting, imaginative world and put it in a movie that works."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," A feast for the eyes if not necessarily the brain, this adaptation of a science-fiction novel by British author Philip Reeve finds its narrative substance overwhelmed by visual spectacle. Despite its ambitious post-apocalyptic premise, the muddled and convoluted screenplay is a disappointment considering it’s written by the Lord of the Rings team of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, all of which have won Oscars. As the story opens, most of Earth has been ravaged by a conflict known as the Sixty Minute War, leaving many survivors caught up in the concept of “Municipal Darwinism,” which refers to smaller mobile cities being literally swallowed up by larger ones. For example, London has stacked many of its landmarks and citizens on a rolling tank-like mechanism. That’s where a scarred young woman named Hester (Hera Hilmar) climbs aboard with a mission — to kill the archaeologist (Hugo Weaving) who allegedly murdered her mother. Her quest for revenge turns into a fight for survival alongside Tom (Robert Sheehan), who likewise has a score to settle but few resources at his disposal. Gradually, they assemble a ragtag group of young rebels with the goal of infiltrating London and stopping the development of a massive weapon that could wipe out most of the remaining human population. Flashbacks gradually reveal more details about Hester’s back story, including her bizarre relationship with Shrike (Stephen Lang), a disfigured skeleton creature who has since become an enemy. Under rookie director Christian Rivers, who worked as a storyboard artist on Jackson’s films, Mortal Engines is an impressive technical achievement, including a stylish depiction of a stark dystopian landscape combined with seamless special effects. The opening chase sequence, when we first see entire cities on wheels, is especially something to behold. The script includes elements of political allegory regarding immigration and imperialism, also functioning as a cautionary tale about futuristic urban planning and mechanical engineering as it funnels into an elaborately chaotic finale. At any rate, this latest attempt to launch a young-adult fantasy franchise is saddled with characters who aren’t as compelling as their surroundings. That limits the incentive for emotional investment, either in the outcome of this first installment or any that might follow."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," PLOT:  In a post-apocalyptic future, the remnants of civilization are divided into two camps: Tractionists, who roam the wasteland in giant mobile cities eating up smaller cities, and Anti-Tractionists – who seek to rebuild civilization by settling on land. Head of the Tractionists is Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), who survives an assassination attempt by the scarred Hester (Hera Hilmar), an attack witnessed by historian Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), who gets thrown together with Hester in a flight from Valentine’s minions. REVIEW:  What makes a company sink over a hundred million dollars into a sprawling fantasy epic with no stars, that’s based on a property with only minor name recognition, and blatantly steals from the MAD MAX series (specifically FURY ROAD) and STAR WARS? Peter Jackson I presume, with this being the latest effort from his WingNut Films, one which he also produced and co-wrote (with regular collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens). If Universal was hoping this would be a new franchise, they need to think again, as despite some arresting eye candy, this is as generic a sci-fi/steampunk thriller as they come, made all the worse by a silly premise and so much-world building that it feels like a ten episode season of a TV show cut-down to two hours. If ever there was evidence that fantasy, when not based on an established property, is better off being done long-form on TV, this is it. Too much happens too quickly. Characters come in and out of the film at random, only to perish a few scenes later in moments that are supposed to be impactful but aren’t. Others seems to exist only to provide exposition, such as a clunky subplot featuring the baddie’s daughter (Leila George) and an engineer (Ronan Raftery) who do nothing but explain things or catch us up on the complicated history of the film’s post-apocalyptic universe. It’s the kind of movie that if you pop out for a minute to go to the bathroom, you’ll be utterly lost by the time you’re back in your seat. One of the biggest problems this film has is the fact that the characters are so generic. They’re based on familiar archetypes, and unlikely to cause an audience to identify with them in enough of a way that they’ll want to see a franchise built around them. No one is bad, per se, but a few more recognizable actors peppered-in would have helped this stand-out from the pack a little more. Of them all, heroine Hera Hilmar stands out the most, with her flaming red hair and the distinct scar she’s given – although she’s far too attractive to justify all the characters reacting with disgust when then see the scar. It actually makes her look kinda cool – and I have I hard time believing it would make anyone shun her. Robert Sheehan is fine but two-dimensional as the romantic lead, and co-star Jihae, as the anti-heroine Anna Fang, is clearly meant to be a breakout star, but the performance is a tad stilted to really connect – although that’s not her failing as an actress, but rather a symptom of the material. As the baddie, Weaving is saddled with a ridiculous wig, while Stephen Lang, at least, manages to inject a little heart as Shrike, a kind of zombie robot with a grudge against our heroine. I’d wager the only reason to see MORTAL ENGINES is if you’re a fantasy addict, but there are a lot of better options out there for your holiday viewing. The eye candy is pretty, but the premise of mobile cities is so silly that the premise falls apart before the movie can even begin – although I’ll give it this – it has an excellent score by Junkie XL. So maybe buy the score – but skip the film. It’s not worth the trip. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel.  We have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 Years Later, a trilogy of sequels to Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later. The Fall Guy just hit CinemaCon for a victory lap after premiering at SXSW. Does it live up to the hype and give Ryan Gosling a clasic role?"
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," December is usually the time of year that the movie world is dominated by a mix of prestige dramas with awards aspirations and family fare designed to take advantage of the holiday season. Increasingly, though, the major studios tend to find room to sneak a blockbuster or two onto the schedule – an opportunity to offer some counterprogramming to those who love big movies with big budgets and big spectacle. Universal is banking on exactly that sort of success with the release of “Mortal Engines” from Peter Jackson’s studio, WingNut Films. Based on the book by Philip Reeve, “Mortal Engines” imagines a world in the far-flung future where weapons of mass destruction have crippled the Earth and certain cities have turned into mobile battle tanks in an attempt to survive. The biggest and baddest of these cities is London, led by Valentine (Hugo Weaving), whose lust for power drives his every move. He eventually runs afoul of Tom (Robert Sheehan), who accidentally witnesses him attempt to murder a mysterious young girl, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), and is banished from London to assure Valentine can cover his tracks. Forming an uneasy alliance, Hester and Tom soon discover Valentine’s plan to build a super weapon and destroy the shield wall protecting Shan Guo, a peaceful land of non-mobile cities he sees as rife for pillage. They team up with Fang (Jihae), a hotshot pilot with the resistance, to take on Valentine and end things once and for all. Director Christian Rivers has never helmed a feature himself, but he’s no stranger to the world of big budget movies. Rivers has been working with Peter Jackson for nearly his entire career, storyboarding all of his movies since “Braindead” and working extensively on visual effects for all of his films. It’s safe to say that, after working on the “Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” films, he would feel completely at home with a movie of the scope and scale of “Mortal Engines.” And from the perspective of a visual and storyboard artist, it’s easy to see where his talents lie. Rivers was given a $100 million-plus budget, and that money is clearly visible all over the screen. The size of these giant cities rumbling across an arid countryside is the sort of sight designed for the big screen, and when it comes time for action, he blows things up but good. It’s clear where his expertise lies. This is the danger you run with a visual effects supervisor turned director. The visuals of “Mortal Engines” are undeniably impressive, but they barely cover the tremendous shortcomings of the script. There was a time when Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens would have been considered a feather in the movie’s cap, but their penchant for epic, exhaustive storytelling and hero’s journey clichés fails to play well with a director who couldn’t care less about the story or characters if he tried. The movie’s world-building is generally reduced to word salad phrases like “Municipal Darwinism” and “anti-tractionists” that sound important but mean absolutely nothing. The result is a script deeply convinced of its own cleverness and gravitas that’s executed with the skill of a SyFy original movie. The characters are lifeless piles of archetypes, the love story is completely unbelievable, and while Hugo Weaving gets to sneer and mug his way through the movie as its central villain, nothing ever matters in the slightest. It doesn’t feel lived-in or natural; it’s a theme park ride.  It may be a tad cynical to note the importance that China plays in the film’s climax. Well, not a country named China, as this world is long since past that, but the protagonists are racing to save a Great Wall protecting the sovereign, peace-loving people of clear Chinese descent, so it’s not all that difficult to connect the dots. Blockbusters are increasingly becoming globally focused, with the Chinese market an easy route to success even if a movie fails in the States. It’s tough not to think about the third act of “Mortal Engines” as a direct attempt to make this movie a success in China by making them the good guys. Now, that’s not an inherently bad thing if you build out the foundation and make it work, but the plot design of “Mortal Engines” is so slapdash that there’s no sense of who these people are or their motivations, making them amount to nothing more than their race and a foil for the bad guys. As such, the final battle has no stakes or excitement. There’s no reason to care about these people other than their existence as the opposition to Weaving’s cartoonish villain. It’s the sort of lazy storytelling that almost feels like cultural appropriation, especially when the soldiers arrive in the final scenes wearing a steampunk version of traditional Chinese armor.  In practice, “Mortal Engines” is exactly as dumb as it seems to be on the surface. There’s plenty of room for dumb action movies, and the “Fast and Furious” franchise has proven that those movies can be both fun and outrageously profitable, but Rivers’ film fails because it wants to be more than that. It wants to tell some sweeping story in the grand tradition and turn it into a franchise akin to “Star Wars,” whose plot it cribs from often. Unfortunately, none of it works or resonates. The explosions are cool and the tank cities are well-designed, but it’s all sound and fury. A film like “Mortal Engines” should be a breath of fresh air, the antidote to the litany of superhero movies and endless sequels. Its complete inability to capitalize on that space is a huge disappointment indeed. You can find our full content archive

"Dec 14, 2018",negative," Philip Reeve’s Mortal Engines book is a classic young adult book full of intriguing ideas and cutting social commentary (specifically the book, not the series, as Mortal Engine’s sequels lost their way very quickly). The book is seventeen years old now, making it a strange choice to adapt as the people who were young adults upon its release are adults now, and people who are young adults now have newer and flashier film franchises. As such, Mortal Engines never works out what to be – its first act is a fantastic smorgasbord of all the themes, icons and aesthetics that made the books popular, with great characterization of the protagonist, smart worldbuilding, and impressive production quality. However, as soon as its characters hit the ground of the second act, it devolves rapidly into a generic YA story with bland characters, poorly set up motivations and plans, and a general lack of personality.Mortal Engines is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which cities have been mobilized, turned into giant settlements on wheels that roam the ruined world and prey on smaller towns. The protagonist, played by Robert Sheehan in the film, is a resident of London who discovers the true face of a corrupt patriarch, and is forcefully exiled into the wilderness.While it never turns into an outright bad film, it fails to deliver on the promise set up by its first act. It seems director Christian Rivers understood the book enough to set up the world, but not enough to successfully represent its characters and the themes they stood for – either that, or he felt trotting out tired YA cliches would appeal to the nebulous “audience” better.Open As You Mean To Go OnThe previous plot summary only really covers the first act of the film – after being exiled, the main character teams up with a stranger with a mysterious past (Hera Hilmar), and they go on a variety of adventures: teaming up with a resistance force, begrudgingly growing to fall for each other, and dealing with Hilmar’s troubled past. While it follows the beats of the book fairly well, it burdens them with the many trite cliches of YA fiction that even young adults hate.source: Universal PicturesHilmar’s mysterious past, moody attitude and hidden “deformity” (a tiny scratch on her face, which leads characters to act as though she’s hideously deformed – for some reason?) make her one in a million similar protagonists – the character is indistinguishable from Olivia Cooke’s character from Ready Player One. Besides her past she isn’t given any inkling of character or personality, and there’s no substance behind her “mysterious” persona. Similarly, Sheehan goes on the briefest of character arcs near the climax of the film and has no growth or change otherwise – which is curious given that in the first act of the film he’s portrayed in a surprisingly nuanced way, with a unique perspective on the world, the past, and the characters of the story.The other characters are the same, with no characterization, motivations, or chemistry to speak of. The villain, played by Hugo Weaving, could be the closest to an actual character throughout, although of course his greatest moments of nuance and perspective are all in the first act.The action is a rather mixed bag – while the city chases and action setpieces are rather well choreographed and filmed, gunfights are mediocre and hand-to-hand combat is shot in a totally bewildering way. Perhaps as a result of the fact that it’s impossible to be invested in the characters, the entire climax of the film is terrifyingly dull.source: Universal PicturesHowever, it’s the story that really lets the the film down. The characters have no real influence on the plot until the end, as they’re constantly wandering about with no real direction. A subplot towards the middle of the film takes full focus for a good half hour until it’s suddenly resolved and, although this subplot was present in the book, it feels purely included to dig up a certain, spoilery cliche. Similarly, the rebellion the characters join seems built on a foundation of insufferable YA tropes and cliches, with a lack of camaraderie, conviction or personality making them perhaps the most boring part of the film.While some of the offending elements were present in the book, in it they all served the story’s themes and ideas. In Mortal Engines the film, they’re just used as performative elements to signal that it’s a YA film, without intrinsically contributing anything themselves.Finding Your ThemesWhile the book Mortal Engines was an exciting and imaginative dystopian thriller (before dystopian meant the bland aesthetic it does now), it worked perfectly as a metaphor for state capitalism. It does, after all, tell the story of giant city states hunting down and recycling smaller settlements – the rulers of large states order their moving economies to literally consume smaller ones with no regard for the good or longevity of the people, resulting in various economic, social and cultural crises.The most pleasantly surprising part of Mortal Engines is that it does import insightful social commentary from the book, although it portrays the actions of its villains and the giant cities more as indicative of colonialism than capitalism. The distinctly Victorian production design and costumes all seem to defer to notions of the British Empire, perpetuated in the Victorian times, in which Britain, and its beating heart London, forged a huge empire with no regard for the people and lands they conquered.This is exactly what happens in the introductory action scene, as a giant London with the Union Jack emblazoned on it hunts down and captures a smaller settlement. The seemingly-heroic Hugo Weaving tells the captured prisoners that they are all welcome to the city – all whilst guards seize their belongings, and their old city is demolished in the background to become part of the amorphous mass that is London. This scene in particular works as a cutting and insightful critique of the damaging effect of forced globalization and capitalist-driven colonialism.source: Universal PicturesUnfortunately, this theme is largely forgotten for the remainder of the film. While the climax of the film could be interpreted as a denouement to this idea, it seems more a side-effect of keeping the plot of the books than an intentional continuation of the theme.The themes presented at the beginning of the film are some of the aspects parts of the film – old statues of Minions referred to as deities of “the ancient ones” (modern humans) is amusing, and mentions of the fallen civilization intercut with archaic iPhones and other technology all worked well to set up the tale as a cautionary tale of destructive technology, the “necessary” evils of capitalism and the tragic logical conclusion to British colonialism. It’s just a shame the majority of the film forgets to extrapolate on these ideas.Mortal Engines: ConclusionIt’s a real pity that Mortal Engines wasted its potential so much, because for the half-hour of the film it far exceeded any other YA film in terms of skilled storytelling and filmmaking. It was even shaping up to be one of the best fantasy films of the year – until the YA cliches got in the way and drained the reserves of personality it had.The characters are bland, but never offensively so. The action is forgettable but, apart from a select few scenes, it’s never a total drag. The pacing is wonky, but the story is always clearly going somewhere.

Hilmar’s mysterious past, moody attitude and hidden “deformity” (a tiny scratch on her face, which leads characters to act as though she’s hideously deformed – for some reason?) make her one in a million similar protagonists – the character is indistinguishable from Olivia Cooke’s character from Ready Player One. Besides her past she isn’t given any inkling of character or personality, and there’s no substance behind her “mysterious” persona. Similarly, Sheehan goes on the briefest of character arcs near the climax of the film and has no growth or change otherwise – which is curious given that in the first act of the film he’s portrayed in a surprisingly nuanced way, with a unique perspective on the world, the past, and the characters of the story. The other characters are the same, with no characterization, motivations, or chemistry to speak of. The villain, played by Hugo Weaving, could be the closest to an actual character throughout, although of course his greatest moments of nuance and perspective are all in the first act.The action is a rather mixed bag – while the city chases and action setpieces are rather well choreographed and filmed, gunfights are mediocre and hand-to-hand combat is shot in a totally bewildering way. Perhaps as a result of the fact that it’s impossible to be invested in the characters, the entire climax of the film is terrifyingly dull.source: Universal PicturesHowever, it’s the story that really lets the the film down. The characters have no real influence on the plot until the end, as they’re constantly wandering about with no real direction. A subplot towards the middle of the film takes full focus for a good half hour until it’s suddenly resolved and, although this subplot was present in the book, it feels purely included to dig up a certain, spoilery cliche. Similarly, the rebellion the characters join seems built on a foundation of insufferable YA tropes and cliches, with a lack of camaraderie, conviction or personality making them perhaps the most boring part of the film.While some of the offending elements were present in the book, in it they all served the story’s themes and ideas. In Mortal Engines the film, they’re just used as performative elements to signal that it’s a YA film, without intrinsically contributing anything themselves.Finding Your ThemesWhile the book Mortal Engines was an exciting and imaginative dystopian thriller (before dystopian meant the bland aesthetic it does now), it worked perfectly as a metaphor for state capitalism. It does, after all, tell the story of giant city states hunting down and recycling smaller settlements – the rulers of large states order their moving economies to literally consume smaller ones with no regard for the good or longevity of the people, resulting in various economic, social and cultural crises.The most pleasantly surprising part of Mortal Engines is that it does import insightful social commentary from the book, although it portrays the actions of its villains and the giant cities more as indicative of colonialism than capitalism. The distinctly Victorian production design and costumes all seem to defer to notions of the British Empire, perpetuated in the Victorian times, in which Britain, and its beating heart London, forged a huge empire with no regard for the people and lands they conquered.This is exactly what happens in the introductory action scene, as a giant London with the Union Jack emblazoned on it hunts down and captures a smaller settlement. The seemingly-heroic Hugo Weaving tells the captured prisoners that they are all welcome to the city – all whilst guards seize their belongings, and their old city is demolished in the background to become part of the amorphous mass that is London. This scene in particular works as a cutting and insightful critique of the damaging effect of forced globalization and capitalist-driven colonialism.source: Universal PicturesUnfortunately, this theme is largely forgotten for the remainder of the film. While the climax of the film could be interpreted as a denouement to this idea, it seems more a side-effect of keeping the plot of the books than an intentional continuation of the theme.The themes presented at the beginning of the film are some of the aspects parts of the film – old statues of Minions referred to as deities of “the ancient ones” (modern humans) is amusing, and mentions of the fallen civilization intercut with archaic iPhones and other technology all worked well to set up the tale as a cautionary tale of destructive technology, the “necessary” evils of capitalism and the tragic logical conclusion to British colonialism. It’s just a shame the majority of the film forgets to extrapolate on these ideas.Mortal Engines: ConclusionIt’s a real pity that Mortal Engines wasted its potential so much, because for the half-hour of the film it far exceeded any other YA film in terms of skilled storytelling and filmmaking.

"Dec 14, 2018",negative," This visionary mess is this year's ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"" a big budget bust that was somehow financed by a major studio despite being made for an audience of, well, who, exactly? Maybe 11-year-olds who play ""World of Warcraft"" will like it. No one else will, at least not un-ironically.  The premise should require its own Wikipedia entry. At least 1,100 years in the future, ""traction cities"" — think London as a giant tank — roam the Earth and swallow up smaller independent settlements, which are also on wheels. The communities on board London have museums filled with ancient junk from our current times; known as ""The Screen Age,"" our era is reduced to statues of Minions and a couple of cracked iPhones.  Outside the big mobile metropolis, rebel warrior Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) seeks her opportunity for revenge against Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), a cartoonishly villainous and power hungry London authority figure. When she misses her shot, she's forced to wander the countryside with Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), a historian who's fallen out of favor with Valentine who helps her in her quest to get back on board and take down the bad guy.  Directed by Peter Jackson apprentice Christian Rivers and based on the 2001 young adult novel, ""Mortal Engines"" isn't savvy enough to work as social commentary, and is too clunky to work as an action movie. Even its leads are unappealing; Hilmar and Sheehan have the romantic chemistry of a brother and sister. It adds up to a giant slog, a movie that, despite its ambitious look, doesn't manage to offer us anything new. In the Screen Age, we'd refer to it as an epic fail."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," For though it’s based on the first volume of Philip Reeve’s highly regarded young adult series and adapted by the same trio who won an Oscar for “Lord of the Rings,” from a dramatic point of view this story set 1,700 years in the future is static and inert. The directing debut for Peter Jackson protege Christian Rivers, who won a visual effects Oscar for “King Kong,” “Mortal Engines” is bursting with everything you’d want except compelling emotional intelligence. Made completely in New Zealand with a cast largely devoid of big names and taking advantage of the movie-making community that created the “Rings” and “The Hobbit” trilogies, “Mortal Engines” elicits marvelous work from a Weta Digital team including visual effects supervisor Ken McGaugh and animation supervisor Dennis Yoo. In fact, so many worlds are imagined and created in such meticulous detail — production designer is Dan Hennah, conceptual art director is Ra Vincent, cinematographer is Simon Raby — that at moments you cease caring how flat the storytelling is and give yourself over to this insane film, half wonderful and half monotonous. Where Rivers, the actors and the screenwriting team of Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson went wrong is hard to pin down specifically. Though the plot of “Mortal Engines” barrels along in terms of events, it’s only sporadically involving on the level it intends to be. So many worlds are created in such meticulous detail that at moments you cease caring how flat the storytelling is and give yourself over to this insane film. The film begins with a recap of the past — how the use of a terrifying weapon of mass destruction had catastrophic results. “Sixty minutes,” we’re told, “is all it took for the ancients to bring humanity to the brink of extinction.” What exists now, in the 38th century, is a world of impossibly large predator cities on wheels, steampunk-influenced monstrosities that look like Howl’s Moving Castle (from the Hayao Miyazaki film) pumped up on steroids. The greatest of these traction cities, as they’re called, is London, where the presiding genius, though not the actual ruler, is accomplished scientist Thaddeus Valentine, played by the film’s only recognizable star, “LOTR” veteran Hugo Weaving. Throwing us right into the middle of things, “Mortal Engines” opens with London on wheels chasing down a small Bavarian mining town the way a massive lion would close in on an unlucky antelope. London’s great enemy, off somewhere in the distant East protected by a massive force field, is the stationary metropolis of Shan Guo. (Though the novel was written in 2001, its East versus West face-off feels eerily contemporary.) Yes, it all sounds completely nuts, but the gift of the visual imagination invested in this film is to make it appear before us in a completely convincing way. The people, unfortunately, not so much. Introduced as a London resident is Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), a nerdy enthusiast for the past who works for the city’s Historians’ Guild and looks after artifacts like “American deities” we immediately recognize as large-scale Minions replicas. One of the things Tom always keeps an eye out for are pieces of what’s called old tech, remnants of the weapon systems that nearly destroyed the earth that Tom correctly thinks are still too dangerous to be out and about. We also spend considerable time with the mysterious Hester Shaw (Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar), introduced wearing a red bandanna that hides a scarred face. (The scar is considerably worse in the book, leading to online back and forth between the filmmakers and the novel’s fans.) Not in London when the film begins, Hester has reasons rooted in her past for wanting to access the city. But no sooner does she achieve that than she and Tom are almost simultaneously thrown together and thrown off the city, left to fend for themselves on earth’s trackless wastes. The pair survive on found food like antediluvian Twinkies from back in the day, causing Hester to knowingly proclaim, “the food of the ancients is indestructible.” They also meet some wild and crazy characters like Anna Fang (Jihae), a hip aviatrix with a price on her head who’s also the head of something called the Anti-Traction League. Much scarier is the nightmarish Shrike (“Avatar’s” Stephen Lang), the last of the Lazarus brigade, a zombie-type individual, half man, half machine, who is obsessed with finding Hester. All this may sound involving on paper, but on screen “Mortal Engines” manages to be largely devoid of dramatic energy. Yet it’s a measure of how captivating its visuals are that I wouldn’t hesitate to see it again if only to try and pin down just what went wrong."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," Mortal Engines is a surprisingly fitting name for what is, hopefully, the last tired attempt at a YA dystopian franchise starter to cough and sputter its way into theaters. Like most of the others, it takes place in a distant future where people talk pretty much the same way we do now except they have kind of funny names (Magnus Crome! Dr. Twix!) and it’s up to a young person and their friends to topple an unjust, authoritarian system. Our familiarity with the formula is, tragically, only part of the reason the movie feels like it’s a hundred hours long. This time around, we drop in more than a millennium after our present day. The cities and towns of Europe have gone mobile, becoming huge, fossil fuel-driven contraptions on which the citizenry lives and works. Smaller towns drive around Europe mining what they can from the soil while the larger, “predator” cities hunt them down and strip them of resources. One such city is London, where the lead historian, Thaddeus Valentine (another funny name!), played by Hugo Weaving, has designs on increasing the firepower and dominance of his moving metropolis. However, a young woman with a personal vendetta, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), seeks to take him down. To do so, she teams up with an apprentice historian, Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) and, eventually, an increasingly indistinct band of rebels. That’s just an economical description of the story. There’s actually much more. Way too much, in fact, as evidenced by the lengths of time Mortal Engines has to devote to explaining itself. Even after the opening narration, most of the first act seems to be taken up by dialogue that fills in the gaps of how the world came to be this way and the specific rules of daily life within it. Those bits are broken up by the occasional massive and noisy visual effects sequence and then we return to exposition. Yet even with all the tab-keeping the movie seems to be doing, it’s still inconsistent. It’s dangerous for two people on foot to build a fire out in the wild because a scavenger town might find them but it is apparently okay for a seemingly undefended village to drive around with its crazy big headlights on. That’s just nitpicking, though. That kind of laziness is more than acceptable in a movie that excels where it counts. But Mortal Engines doesn’t do that either. Whatever class critique allegories are present, they are thousandth generation copies; the movie’s London is an uninspired blend of Metropolis and Titanic, with various classes assigned to literal “tiers.” Any attempts to reach beyond that are clumsy and potentially offensive. When London captures a salt-mining town, the townsfolk are warned by an offscreen voice via loudspeaker that children may be separated from their parents, a line that could very well have been added only recently to address real life events. Later, Hester and Tom will be put up for bid in a slave auction. Because of the superficiality of these representations of actual events, they are tasteless where director Christian Rivers and screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson might imagine they are poignant. These feints at, I suppose, social consciousness also ring hollow when stacked alongside the movie’s patronizing, backwards Orientalism. Valentine’s ultimate target is the verdant land beyond the “Shield Wall,” which separates Europe from a peaceful society of Asian people who have not pillaged and polluted their own homes. On the plus side, though, this condescending characterization at least helps distinguish some individuals from others, something the flat, homogenous, humorless screenplay is otherwise unable to accomplish. Rivers matches the script with a color palette that is as dull as the rest of the movie and a sense of framing that feels haphazard more often than not. I would call Mortal Engines the most stupefyingly wrongheaded post-apocalyptic movie since Kevin Costner’s The Postman but I fear its unrelenting drabness makes it even worse."
"Dec 14, 2018",negative," Mortal Engines, which is produced by Peter Jackson and written by the team behind the Lord of the Rings films, is grandly, majestically, epically inert, a high-concept fantasy with a wide chasm between the money we see up on the screen and poverty of the story. In the line of such recent eye-candy productions as Luc Besson's Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets or Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One,  the movie is adapted from young adult fiction: the first of Philip Reeve’s four steam punk–styled Mortal Engines novel series. The premise, which is never easy to swallow, is that in the post-apocalyptic future, entire cities are mounted on tank treads, and race about ravaging the devastated planet's remaining resources in a battle of ""municipal Darwinism."" Most of the action takes place in London, now a jumble of tiered buildings with the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral on top and the London Eye Ferris wheel carting people up and down. In the opening and best sequence, we see the big London tank, which is now roaming about Bavaria, chasing down a small mobile mining town, harpooning it and drag it on board, where the resources are sucked up and the citizens put to work. In short order, we move from the far-fetched to the exasperating. First-time director Christian Rivers, a long-time story-board and visual effects co-ordinator for Jackson's films, shows little sensitivity to performances or the mechanics of storytelling, establishing the information and emotional beats in an effective fashion. Our timid, insipid lead is Tom (Robert Sheehan) a nervous apprentice at the Museum of London, specializing in the technology of the ""ancients"" as folks from our era are called.  His work earns the interest of Thaddeus Valentine (Hugh Weaving), who clearly wants these old computer parts for nefarious purposes. Somewhere deep inside the teeming transit system, Tom, Thadeus and the latter’s daughter, Katherine (Leila George) encounter a young assassin, with a scarf covering her scarred face, who stabs Thaddeus, non-fatally. Tom chases her as she races off through the gnashing gears and tunnels of the city's underbelly, but both of them end up getting tossed down a giant waste chute to the outside world. The would-be assassin, named Hester Shaw (Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar) has a grudge against Thaddeus for killing her archaeologist mother when Hester was a child.  Tom and Hester are stranded together in the rocky wasteland and then, later, locked together in a room where they fight and fall in love as they struggle to find their way back to the city so Hester can finish her assassination plans. Meanwhile, the definitely, absolutely and irrefutably evil Thaddeus is busy building a super-weapon to launch from the dome of St. Paul's that will wipe out a huge wall protecting the ""static"" cities to the east. Worried that his would-be killer Hester is still alive, Thaddeus sends a zombie with a skull head and glowing jade eyes named Shrike (Stephen Lang) to get rid of her. You see, Shrike feels betrayed by Hester because he was sort of a daddy figure after her mother was killed but honestly who cares? The guy’s a killer zombie. While the action splashes and explodes across the screen, fantasy fans can check off the references: Howl's Moving Castle, Mad Max, and lots of Star Wars, all pushed into the same garburator.  Some variety from the over-familiar is provided by a flashy rebel assassin from the ethnically diverse resistance, named Anna Fang (played by American-based, Korean-born musician Jihae), who sports a rockabilly pompadour and flies about in a red dragon-fly like airship.

FILM REVIEW – MORTAL ENGINES. With Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan, Hugo Weaving, Jihae, Stephen Lang. Written by Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens & Peter Jackson. Directed by Christian Rivers. Rated PG-13 for sequences of futuristic violence and action. 128 minutes. It’s obvious why the ads for MORTAL ENGINES prominently mention “Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit.” Peter Jackson, who helmed those series, was one of the writers and producers on this. However, there the connection ends, because unlike the Tolkien adaptations, this is no twee fantasy. It is squarely in the science fiction sub-genre of “steampunk,” positing a post-apocalyptic world utilizing a lot of retro- tech. Based on the YA novel by Philip Reeve, this is a dystopian and visually inventive movie that – with no big names in the cast – may have a hard time finding its audience. The setting is many centuries in the future after a destructive war that has laid waste to much of the world. Several cities have become mobile, gobbling up smaller enclaves and their resources. Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), is an important official in the mobile London, surviving an assassination attempt by Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) at the start of the story. Hester escapes and is forced to team with Tom (Robert Sheehan), a historian of artifacts who has been betrayed by Thaddeus. The story gets complicated (although not difficult to follow) as Hester and Thaddeus head for a final showdown. Added to the mix is Shrike (Stephen Lang), a horrific creature pursuing Hester who proves to be one of the most complex characters in the story, and Anna Fang (Jihae), who will prove crucial in the fight against Thaddeus. Although the book was followed by several others, the movie gets us to a definitive ending, leaving the door open for sequels but not requiring them. What makes it fascinating even for those unfamiliar with the source material (like this reviewer) is its stunning visual design. From a vast city rolling across desolate wastelands, to the “technology,” which is based more on trying to recapture what was lost from the past rather than inventing something new, what we’re shown is never less than fascinating. Not since “Black Panther” have we seen a movie so determined to take us into a world we’ve never seen on screen prior to this. As the smooth villain of the piece, Weaving walks the line between his character’s public image and his actual motives to make clear why people might be fooled into believing him. As the film’s protagonist, Hilmar may be the first Icelandic actress to become an international star. She’s feisty as Hester, able to show her vulnerabilities while remaining a strong and tenacious heroine. This may turn out to be the break for her that “Hunger Games” was for Jennifer Lawrence.
