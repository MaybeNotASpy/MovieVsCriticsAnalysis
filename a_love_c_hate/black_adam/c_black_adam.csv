"Oct 5, 2023",negative," It’s probably for the best that Warner Bros. is partially rebooting its DC Extended Universe and taking it in a more broadly appealing direction. Black Adam is the perfect example of how all their prior efforts have been for naught. The plain simple truth of the DCEU is that its dark and gritty styles aren’t broadly appealing. Such designs might make the efforts feel realistic, but they are gloomy and that will sell to a certain demographic, but not to others. Warner Bros. has been trying to back off the darkness and grime that Zack Snyder has infused into the franchise for a few years now, but their inability to find a formula that works is more obvious in a film like Black Adam than it ever has been before. Played by Dwayne Johnson, Black Adam is an anti-hero locked away for centuries. In an effort to thwart the theft of a demonic crown, he is awakened and his thirst for vengeance isn’t easily slaked. Meanwhile, a group known as the Justice Society is hired by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to bring this dangerous threat in and lock him away in her supervillain prison. While the theme of the film is to question what the definition of superhero should be if they aren’t going to thwart all villainy in the world, the producers have shoved the film so full of visual effects and one-liners that its noble intentions are largely crushed beneath the weight of pomp and circumstance. One of the most notable issues with Johnson as an actor is his constant mugging for the camera. When he’s not sufficiently counterbalanced by better actors (such as in the Jumanji films), his performances tend to topple over the edge of tastefulness. That’s largely true of his performance here, which is notably lacking in charm and gravitas. Part of this is the writing, but much of it is his looming presence. He’s a “movie star” and the director isn’t able to rein that in sufficiently. Even with strong actors like Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan in place, there’s little that they are able to do, yet they still come off as more conscionable and appealing heroes even if their concept of heroism is tempered by a need for propriety and societal balance. What the exact fate of each DC character will be is not fully known. Though based on the mediocrity of this film, one might hazard a guess that Black Adam will be the end of Johnson’s DCEU line."
"Oct 4, 2023",positive," Though slow to get into its stride, once it does, Black Adam is fun — not OMG, eyeball-searing movie magic, but jolly good nonetheless. The 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), this Shazam! spin off begins 5,000 years ago in somewhere-istan, this time going by the name of Kahndaq. Among the sand and soaring cliffs of Kahndaq is a rare and precious metal, Eternium. What is with these faux-Latin sounding fantastical metals; remember unobtainium and vibranium? Anyway, that is a story for another time. Back to the Jaume Collet-Serra (Jungle Cruise) led Black Adam where the despotic king Anh-Kot, intends to use Eternium to create the Crown of Sabbac, to get unlimited power and rule the world... you get the drift. A slave boy leads a revolt, and just at the moment of his execution, becomes all-powerful and challenges sneery king Anh-Kot. Five thousand years later, Kahndaq’s miseries are not over as the country is being ruled by a gang of mercenaries. A university professor who is also a resistance fighter, Adrianna, (Sarah Shahi) is looking for the Crown of Sabbacc to ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands. The wrong hands, led by Ishmael (Marwan Kenzari) have watched enough movies to know that they just have to follow the good professor, turn one of her team against her, and the crown is in your pocket or on your head. However, before that happens, Adrianna wakes up the slumbering superhero Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) and all hell breaks loose. The Justice Society of America (JSA) is called in to neutralise Adam much to the dismay of Adrianna’s superhero-mad son, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui). The JSA led by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) with Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan) providing irritatingly-vague predictions in hindsight, Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) eager to fill his uncle’s shoes, and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) head to Kahndaq only to realise the ground reality is rather different. All naturally comes right in the end in a storm of CGI with that mid-credit sequence showing the deliciously dimpled meta-human promising much joy to come. Brosnan lends gravitas, while Centineo and Swindell have a cool chemistry.  Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

"Aug 17, 2023",negative," Some five thousand years ago, Teth Adam (Dwayne Johnson) was endowed with the gifts of the gods and arose as the saviour of the Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq, freeing the country from its oppressors and slavers. Cut to modern-day Kahndaq, and the country is once again under oppressive occupation – this time by the international crime syndicate known as Intergang. But when a group of treasure hunters stumble on Teth Adam's tomb and accidentally bring him back to life, the future of Khandaq is irrevocably changed. Whether it's for the better or worse remains to be seen, but Teth Adam's ruthless approach quickly draws the attention of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who sends the legendary superhero group, the Justice Society, to Khandaq to take him down. Much of the hype surrounding Black Adam has been that it's the film that will change the DC Extended Universe forever. So, it's ironic that though there is certainly a lot to enjoy about DC's latest superhero film, it's remarkable how much it plays out like a very by-the-numbers origin story. But then, the whole idea of changing the DCEU in the first place is rather suspect, what with Warner Brothers' attempt to match Marvel Studio's success with their roster of DC Comics characters having been a chaotic mess right from the off. That chaos has given rise to superior superhero flicks like Wonder Woman, Shazam, The (emphasis: ""the"") Suicide Squad, and Birds of Prey, but the reason those films worked, really, was because they were largely self-contained. With Warner's having been bought out once again – this time by Discovery (not that one) – plans seem to be afoot to take another swing at trying to match the cohesiveness of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And much of the (admittedly unofficial) hype around the film was that Black Adam would be the turning point for the DCEU. Apparently, no one told screenwriters Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani; however, because though it is clearly supposed to be in the shared DC Universe (I think we can pretty safely say by this point that Viola Davis is fulfilling much the same role at DC as Samuel L Jackson did at Marvel), the film is weirdly disconnected from what came before. For example, why does Waller send the Justice Society to go after Black Adam when this is a world where the Justice League already exists and, for that matter, didn't Waller create Task Force X (the official name for the Suicide Squad) to deal with Superman-level threats like this? The film doesn't even bother to explain who the Justice Society are – and, for that matter, why this ""society"" has only four members. For the record, the Justice Society of America was the first-ever superhero team that debuted way back in 1940 and included the likes of Hawkman and Dr Fate, as seen here, but also the original versions of The Flash, Green Lantern, the Sandman, and others. They're kind of a big deal. Even more baffling, though, is the complete and utter absence of Shazam. Not only was Black Adam originally a Shazam (aka Captain Marvel) villain, but he transforms from an ordinary man into his ""super self"" by uttering the magic word that is both an acronym for a group of gods and the name of the wizard that gave him his powers... Shazam! Djimon Hounsou returns as the Wizard Shazam in a brief cameo, but the character is not mentioned by name, and there is not even the slightest hint that Shazam has a new modern champion who is imbued with the same gifts. A character that has already been played by Zachary Levi and Asher Angel, and whose sequel is literally the very next film to be released by DC/ Warners early next year!  Once again, this feels like a DC film with a whole bunch of cuts made to it – add to all of the above a credit to Jack Kirby's Fourth World, which doesn't appear in Black Adam at all – but unlike, say, Suicide Squad or Batman v Superman, it remains a reasonably cohesive and relatively straightforward (anti-) hero origin story. For both good and ill. On the bad side, director Jaume Collet-Serra, who is something of a veteran at mid-budget thrillers and horror flicks and who just recently teamed up with Dwayne Johnson for Jungle Cruise, seems completely lost in putting together decent action scenes here. The CGI is perfectly decent, but it is relied on far too heavily to give the film any weight. For some unknown reason, he or the film's producers decided to bring back the dreaded abuse of slow-motion to punctuate every single action scene, apparently not having learned anything at all from Zack Snyder's ridiculous excesses. More than anything, though, there's just a sense of tedium to these weakly choreographed, by-the-numbers action scenes that may certainly have some very cool moments but become quite numbing very quickly. Never is this more true than during the ""climactic"" battle, which is just a badly conceived trudge of messy action, a totally crap villain (and not so well CGI-rendered, in this case) and a weird case of amnesia when it comes to just who the main star is here. Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Dr Fate (Pierce Brosnan) steal the emotional core of the film away from Black Adam himself. Though for the latter, at least, that's not exactly surprising. The man formally (sometimes?) known as the Rock certainly looks the part of Black Adam, and he is more than convincing as a truly unstoppable force of nature. But considering just how stoic and severe a character Black Adam is, he never gets the chance to bring the sense of self-knowing fun that we all love him for to the role. In comparison, Pierce Brosnan is a total blast as Dr Fate, even during his more melancholy moments, and the rest of the Justice Society, including rookies Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), bring a lightness of touch to the proceedings even if they are woefully underdeveloped.  Black Adam is clearly a major passion project for the Rock, and he clearly wanted to go for something of a more dramatic role, but it doesn't always feel like the film is making the best use of his talents. Though, for what it's worth, he still does a very fine job as this more morally ambiguous superhero and handles the more dramatic moments really rather well. Dwayne Johnson is not exactly known for subtlety in his acting, but he's actually very good here at balancing Teth Adams' coldness and arrogance.  Another thing that the film gets very much right is in centring the entire film around this fictional Middle Eastern country called Khandaq. It gives as much space to some of the ordinary people of the country, not least Sarah Shahi as Adrianna Tomaz, the woman who brought Teth Adam back to life, and her son, Amon, played with real charm by Bodhi Sabongui. The film also, I suppose, takes a swing at dealing with colonialism but the only thing new offered to this particular conversation is that Khandaq isn't occupied by a country but by a criminal organisation. Intergang, who are usually more closely linked with Superman than with the Shazam side of DC, but whatever; it's an interesting wrinkle.  What's rather less effective, though, is the way that the film tries to present Black Adam as a new kind of superhero in the DCEU – a super-anti-hero that will gladly kill his enemies. That's presumably why the film turned to the Justice Society rather than the other super teams running around, but the whole thing rings just a little false.  And that, I suppose, is the thing about the film in general. Between its strong cast and stripped-back story (for most of the film, anyway), there's plenty to enjoy about Black Adam – no, this is not another Morbius situation or anything like that – but it's a superhero film that resolutely fails to take off. Like too many superhero origin films, it does feel like this is setting things up for a superior sequel (and hopefully a Justice Society or at least a Dr Fate spin-off), but as beginnings go, it's not half bad."
"Aug 16, 2023",positive," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  The Independent Film Festival Boston’s Fall Focus sets up Thursday for a fast and furious four-day, 11-film stint at The Brattle Theatre. The focus has an international and feminine gaze to it. Opening-night film “Women Talking” by Sara Polley (“The Sweet Hereafter”), as implied, follows an indie A-list of those women, including Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley (“Men,” “I’m Thinking of Ending Things”) and Frances McDormand (“Nomadland”). “One Fine Morning” stars Léa Seydoux (“No Time to Die,” “Blue is the Warmest Color”) as a widowed young mother; “Broker,” the mini-fest’s centerpiece film, marks the latest from Hirokazu Kore-eda (“Shoplifters”); “Hunt” is a Korean spy thriller by Lee Jung Jae. The closing-night film is “The Inspection,” about a gay black man (Jeremy Pope) who joins the Marines in the age of don’t ask, don’t tell; his mother is played by Gabrielle Union. Another film to look for is “Armageddon Time” starring Anthony Hopkins and Anne Hathaway and directed by James Gray (“Ad Astra,” “The Lost City of Z”), a coming-of-age tale set in Reagan-era New York. Other Oscar winners on the docket in addition to Hopkins and McDormand are Olivia Colman (“The Favourite,” “The Lost Daughter”) and Colin Firth (“The King’s Speech”) in “Empire of Light” directed by Sam Mendes (“American Beauty,” “1917”); and “Causeway” starring Jennifer Lawrence (“Joy”) (“If Beale Street Could Talk”) in a tale about a soldier returning home to New Orleans. Brian Tyree Henry co-stars. The latest from Korean director Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy,” “The Handmaiden”) is a dark crime drama in which the lives of a police detective and murder suspect intersect and fold in on each other. It’s a psychological thriller that has Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) looking into the curious death of a skilled rock climber who fell despite safety measures. Gathering the mountainside evidence makes for an interesting process, with a second detective strapped to Hae-jun’s back as they rope walk up the sheer surface. Suspicion falls on the wife, Seo-rae (Tang Wei), a Chinese immigrant who’s not quite fluent in Korean – did I mention that her departed husband was an immigration official? Hae-jun is a hands-on profiler sort and in scenes when observing Seo-rae, he’s suddenly in the room, a ghost to her, observing her. It’s a neat device Park throws at us that blurs the lines between reality and projection. It’s also a reflection of Hae-jun’s detached demeanor; he’s an insomniac, and has a strangely dysfunctional sex life with his wife. Natch, Hae-jun and Seo-rae have an attraction to each other that hangs dank and ripe in every scene they’re in. In the second part of the hypnotic slow burn, both have relocated to the same new city where Seo-rae is married to a fund manager and works as a caregiver to the old. It’s here that the film moves into darker territory, as Seo-rae is visited by a disgruntled client of her husband who slaps her around (the character is actually named Slappy) and there’s another death that cannot be misconstrued an accident or suicide. Of course Hae-jun is the one assigned the case. How Park lays down the cards does have reveals, but it’s mostly a deeply internal reckoning by Hae-jun. The film feels a bit like a true-crime noir and would make a perfect double bill with countryman Bong Jin Ho’s “Memories of Murder” (2003), about Korea’s first true documented serial killer. (Tom Meek) At Landmark Kendall Square Cinema, 355 Binney St. Starting in Kahndaq, a fictional Middle Eastern country, 5,000 years ago, the same wizards as in “Shazam!” (2019) bestow godlike powers to an enslaved person known as Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) to defeat a power-hungry tyrant forging a demonic crown. In the present, resistance fighter Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) hides the omnipotent crown from an evil enterprise oppressing her people and stealing their natural resources. Teth-Adam (dormant all those years in between) answers Adrianna’s cry for help and annihilates Kahndaq’s enemies, which alarms the Justice Society of America. With encouragement from Viola Davis’ CIA heavy Amanda Waller from “The Suicide Squad” (2021) and “Peacemaker,” Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) reunites with old friend Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan) and enlists new recruits – the graceful genius Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) – to battle Johnson’s newly minted Black Adam. But they prove inert against Kahndaq’s champion and garner jeers from Kahndaqians for their intervention. Director Jaume Collet-Serra, by-the-numbers here, relies too much on Zack Snyder-style slo-mo, which at times is insipidly tedious. The cast’s chemistry and running jokes help rescue an otherwise formulaic action film. Brosnan’s elegant performance stands out, and the post-credits scene will leave moviegoers begging for a sequel. The release date is serendipitous, coinciding with Iranian women protesting their government’s oppressive tyranny. It elevates the story of a merciless metahuman accepting a woman’s call for him to wreak havoc on their enemies and rejects the ethical generalization that killing is never the answer. Coupled with “The Suicide Squad,” the DC Universe seems to be taking a provocative stand on international politics and advocating for violent revolt.

"Jul 25, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: Nearly 5,000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the ancient gods - and imprisoned just as quickly - Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is freed from his earthly tomb, ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world. Like most viewers, I don't know anything about the original comics of most superheroes that occupy our theaters nowadays. Whether it's DC, Marvel, or another studio, the respective genre is, without a doubt, the one that brings the largest audiences to the big screen, and it's not hard to understand why. As a fan of this type of film, I'm always more excited when it comes to meeting a new protagonist who I'm unfamiliar with. The marketing campaign surrounding Black Adam promised a movie that would forever change the DCEU power hierarchy, as well as leave a lasting impact on the genre itself... Did it? Yes and no. Black Adam indeed introduces a superhero who is perfectly capable of fighting anyone presented in this cinematic universe so far. However, the film cannot overcome the formulaic barriers surrounding its screenplay. From the narrative structure to the story itself, none of the three screenwriters brings enough originality or imagination to escape the genre's conventionalisms. In addition to being predictable and simply generic, all the essential information is conveyed through exposition-heavy scenes during the entire runtime - be it flashbacks, narration, or forced dialogue. No matter how obvious or important, Black Adam delivers revelations so monotonously that it takes away any impact associated with them. The protagonist Black Adam isn't a traditional hero. Dwayne Johnson embodies his character's terrifying, rage-driven persona, adding the movie's central, most interesting theme to the narrative. The moral and ethical rules of a modern superhero don't fit with the more aggressive, assertive behavior of Adam, resulting in genuinely fascinating conversations with Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan). Too bad Jaume Collet-Serra finds himself torn between two different types of film. On one hand, Black Adam is a dark movie focused on an intense debate between ""good"" and ""evil"", between being merciful or unforgiving, between ""justice"" and ""fate"". On the other hand, moments of humor break the darker tone of the general film and of the protagonist, who presents himself as someone fearsome and to be taken seriously. Comedy ""à la Marvel"" doesn't really work in the atmosphere built for this movie, and DC seems to have problems understanding which films actually work with this type of humor. Honestly, the explanation isn't very complicated. Despite being someone who starts getting increasingly tired of ""Marvel-esque"" comedy, most of the MCU's installments are predisposed to receive that lighter environment. From the bright color palette to the fun personalities of the heroes, without forgetting the lighthearted tone with which they approach more sensitive topics, Marvel built its universe that way. Black Adam shouldn't even try to be witty because its protagonist isn't ""joking around"". It's almost cringy to observe a character trying to throw jokes out of nowhere when Adam finds himself processing his moral dilemmas. This creates a jarring sensation where the viewer doesn't know how to react to Black Adam's discordant tone. However, the cast manages to salvage a good part of the clumsy script. As noted above, Hodge, Brosnan, and Johnson's characters have interesting conversations about how each uses his powers and how the ""bad guys"" should be treated. Johnson is an absolute badass - his physical presence is a significant factor - Hodge is an excellent counterpart, but it's Brosnan who surprises and steals the spotlight with an incredibly absorbing performance. Quintessa Swindell stands out from the rest with striking charisma. When it comes to popcorn entertainment, the movie delivers several action scenes packed with energy and powerful sound design. The combat itself isn't amazing - excessive use of CGI and slow-motion - but when all aspects seem to be in sync - choreography, visual effects, score, camera work, editing - Black Adam shines and delivers a couple of memorable sequences. Lorne Balfe's music completely transforms the most impactful moments, being the only technical element I can genuinely define as ""epic"" and ""chill-inducing"". One last word for the marketing department. Black Adam is one of the most publicized films in recent years - Johnson also played his part - but it becomes dangerous to ""sell"" such generic content as something ""never seen before"". High expectations more easily lead to misleading disappointments, that is, perfectly decent works suffer with public opinion more than they deserve precisely because of the intense marketing that raised too much the levels of anticipation for the movie. Adding a trailer that spoils the sole - and quite effective - narrative twist only creates even more conditions to disappoint countless viewers. Black Adam is far from impressive, being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic, predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated. Lorne Balfe's epic score and a magnificent cast - Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, and most remarkably Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal - try to elevate the decent action and visuals, but the moderate entertainment levels don't make up for the dated narrative structure. Tiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take ""the next step"" in a truly impactful manner."
"Jul 25, 2023",positive,A misunderstood epic kick off to the next era of the DC UNIVERSE. Visceral & Intense action scenes create such a kinetic time that I loved. @TheRock completely became Black Adam & added much needed mythology to the word SHAZAM.
"Jul 21, 2023",negative," One of the most iconic (and meme-worthy) quotes from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in the press build-up for his almost 10-year passion project is that Black Adam will change the hierarchy of power in the DC Universe. Indeed a ballsy claim, no less coming from one of Hollywood’s biggest movie stars. Some saw it as a dig at Superman, the golden boy of DC, who would now apparently play second-fiddle in terms of super-strength levels compared to the Shazam anti-hero.  Then, Johnson came out again and said his film would mark a “new era” of the DC Universe. He later clarified in an interview that he, along with the entire cast and crew, would usher in this change by “listening to the fans…and doing our best to give the fans what they want.” In many ways, Black Adam does listen to the fans, and because of that simple reason, it feels like the most disruptive DC film in decades. Disruptive not because of its disorderly and incongruent parts but for its sheer dedication to producing an entertaining, action-driven film that leaves little room for extreme divisiveness. It’s a safe film, for better and worse. DC fans deserve this kind of fan service after everything they’ve been through. And because the marriage between fandom and comic book movies is almost always a rocky one, this should be considered some sort of a minor miracle.  The film nevertheless leaves much to be desired regarding pacing, tonal consistency, and scriptwriting, perhaps because of the constant pandering to fans. Black Adam ultimately succeeds at doing what most sustainable franchises have always done: creating a passable movie that does not vehemently anger most people (me included).  Does that make it a better film? Hell no. Though you’d be hard-pressed to find a better representation of the equivalent of action figures being clashed by a child who knows only of the pure exuberance derived from seeing super-powered individuals face off against each other.  The story starts with an exposition dump about the history and world of Kahndaq, the ancient city that the enslaved Teth Adam considers his home. After gaining the powers of the Gods and being hailed as the champion of the people, he uses his powers for vengeance and is subsequently imprisoned for it. Nearly 5,000 years later, he’s freed from his entombment and wreaks havoc in his own twisted way. Now seen as a threat to the world, the Justice Society of America or JSA, consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), join together to subdue him. As it turns out, the city of Kahndaq embraces him once more as their champion as he administers the cruel sentence of death on the military occupiers of the nation using his unparalleled superhuman strength. Strangely, Black Adam’s persona has the air of an authoritarian leader from a third-world country. His whole mythology is built around a lie, and yet he is cheered for his displays of machismo and extrajudicial killings. Coincidentally, the JSA is seen as an unpopular foreign invader who has never shown much aid or attention to Kahndaq throughout history, much like colonial forces and international peacekeeping forces.  This intermingling of interventionist rhetoric and the shaky politics of savior narratives could have been a solid foundation that fits the theme of Black Adam being a central figure in blurring the line between good and evil. Unfortunately, there’s just too much going on in this film that even its most interesting commentaries get lost in the fold.  Whenever there’s a moment where you’d think the film begins to tap into its vaguely Middle Eastern-based politics, it pulls back and then never says anything about it later on. A nation embracing an anti-hero is a fruitful conceit that can draw from multiple vantage points in real-life (just take one look at Brazil and even the Philippines), and other films have been geopolitically conscious in the past as well (Black Panther), so I see no reason why Black Adam couldn’t have pushed its parallelisms further. Never once does the film follow through in questioning the privilege of heroes such as Atom Smasher, a literal nepotism baby who is probably more concerned with flirting, or even Cyclone, a teenager sent to a third-world country as a weapon. The previous DC film earlier this year, The Batman, was able to interrogate hypocrisies embedded in its world — why not here too? And then there’s the character of Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) and her son (Bodhi Sabongui), who are supposed to be the surrogate audience stand-in throughout the film. The film goes to a screeching halt whenever it cuts back to their storyline. The opening half is painful and a chore to get through. Shahi is undoubtedly a great actor but feels so generic here, and Sabongui is ill-suited to narrate and give plenty of the supposed heartwarming moments. The film is also incredibly fast-paced, primarily because it knows what the audience wants: to see the bombastic action setpieces. Black Adam packs some of the strongest action in DC thus far, and some of the visual effects (especially one involving Doctor Fate) are astounding to behold. I just wish there were scenes interspersed between some of the action to release the tension or give a breather. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan, Jungle Cruise) wanted to make the “Dirty Harry” of the superhero genre, most likely referencing the Clint Eastwood anti-hero’s rogue personality. Lucky for him, Dwayne Johnson is in the lead and shines with a deadpan and renegade tone. It’s surprising since Johnson is most known for his smoldering and excessive charisma, but he’s more restrained here, and it’s a good thing. In the end, DC eventually needs to snap from its obsession with anti-heroes (like, come on, Joker, Harley Quinn, Suicide Squad, Peacemaker). How hard is it to make a good superhero film, not about a villain? In the meantime, Johnson fulfills his passion project of disrupting the DC Universe by introducing a character that could very well be the focal point of the franchise moving forward. "
"Jul 20, 2023",positive," It’s safe to say that the whole superhero sub-genre that was once filled with awe and excitement has become bloated, generic, and safe. Every other property looks washed-out, devoid of any genuine passion, and filled to the brim with a certain kind of humor that really needs a laugh track to let the viewer know that the poorly written characters are cracking a joke. And even though the bar for such movies and shows is pretty much underground—apart from a handful of critics—you won’t see a lot of people complaining about it and demanding the bare minimum. Instead, you’ll see them pitting critics against fans and defending these billion-dollar companies as if they were indie productions on the brink of bankruptcy. Amidst all this nonsense, much like the last DC project, “The Batman,” “Black Adam” feels like a tangible film and not something that has been made in a parking lot and later polished by overworked VFX artists. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and written by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, “Black Adam” opens with a long expository sequence about the ruler of Kahndaq, King Ahk-Ton (Marwan Kenzari). He wanted to forge a crown made of a mineral called “Eternium” and summon the power of the devils. One day, a kid revolted against him and almost motivated the people of the country to do the same. But he was arrested by the king’s guards and sent for execution. Just when he was about to be killed, he was gifted with the power of Shazam, which he used to destroy King Ahk-Ton. It has been 5000 years since that day, and in the present, archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shah), along with her brother Karim (Mohammed Amer) and colleagues Rami (Patrick Sabongui) and Ishmael (Kenzari), is trying to locate the tomb in which the Crown of Sabbac is hidden. That’s where they awaken the champion preserved in that tomb, Teth-Adam/Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson). And as Adam begins to wreak havoc, the Justice Society – which is made up of Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) – drops in to say “hello.” The most surprising thing about “Black Adam” is that it is openly political in nature. It’s customary to expect superhero shows to address real-life issues on the level that “The Boys” or “Watchmen” have done. But when it comes to movies, they either appear surface-level or extremely problematic. Collet-Serra, along with his team of writers, establishes the two kinds of tyranny Kahndaq has faced. One is that of King Ahk-Ton, who turned his own people into slaves; the second is that of the Intergang, a neo-Imperialist American organization that is oppressing the people of that country while robbing it of its resources. And, like many superhero movies, they pose the Justice Society as the token white savior(s) of this narrative. However, Adam and the people of Kahndaq eventually prove that they don’t need heroes who aren’t even from their continent. They are much more willing to champion one of their own, even if said champion’s history is a little dicey because he’s willing to change for good. Coming to the overall characterization of Black Adam. In “Shazam!,” he was painted as a villain. The Justice Society, particularly Hawkman, treats him as a villain. And, to be fair, Adam’s brutality does make him look like a villain. But the false laurels on his shoulders, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) gushing over his awesomeness (which serves as a great commentary on the commodification of superheroes, in general), and the need to liberate the people of Kahndaq, even though the place is radically different from the Kahndaq from Adam’s time, force him to change his ways. That is some pretty layered stuff, thereby making Black Adam a very interesting character. That said, it gets buried under the heaping amounts of exposition regarding the possession of the Crown of Sabbac, periodic reminders about how the plot is going to progress, and the repetitive exchanges between Hawkman and Black Adam. Yes, all of it is necessary. However, since it’s presented in the same way every time, sometimes with the same set of words, the viewing experience becomes tiring. As mentioned in the title, “Black Adam” compensates for the copious amounts of expository dialogue with copious amounts of action and spectacle. Dwayne Johnson’s entry as the titular character is fantastic. There’s visual comedy. It is quite barbaric. And, most importantly, it looks great. The yellow tint is a bit much. But since it’s consistent throughout the film and makes the production design, costume design, set design, and the displays of power (especially in slow motion) pop on the screen, I didn’t mind it at all. Overall, the CGI-heavy fight sequences fare better than the hand-to-hand, non-CGI battles. I am assuming that’s the case because the bigger set pieces were heavily pre-visualized, pre-planned, and weren’t tinkered with too much. As for the rest, I think there are two issues. The actors relied way too much on their stunt doubles, and the fight choreography and action direction didn’t take that into consideration, thereby leading to the choppy editing. The frenetic cuts also plague some of the conversational scenes, probably to give them a sense of urgency. But that doesn’t work and just makes those scenes jarring. Lorne Balfe’s score is addictive, pulpy, and gives Adam a sense of oomph! You know, I used to be a huge fan of Dwayne Johnson’s work. I have watched and re-watched “The Scorpion King,” “The Rundown,” “Walking Tall,” “Gridiron Gang,” “Tooth Fairy,” “Fast Five,” “Snitch,” and “Pain & Gain.” Then, something happened post “San Andreas,” and, in an attempt to charm everyone, he stopped taking risks. A 2019 GQ article on how the actor doesn’t want to lose a fight on-screen essentially proved the theory that Johnson won’t accept anything that’ll portray him in a negative light. So, when he took on “Black Adam,” it seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to look powerful and stray away from the path of blandness he had been on. And I’ll say it’s a success for the most part. Johnson plays Adam like the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from “Judgment Day,” complete with a kid sidekick who is teaching him about the ways of the world. His hulking body contrasts the hollowness his character feels pretty aptly. His chemistry with Hodge and Brosnan—who are oozing with so much charisma—is great. As for the rest of the cast, Centineo, Sarah, Quintessa, Bodhi, and Amer are very endearing and lovable. Kenzari has no option but to be one-note. But since I didn’t go in expecting a complex villain, I didn’t mind it too much. All in all, “Black Adam” is a movie worth watching on the big screen. Go watch it with your friends and family or on your own. Just ensure that the projector is working well, and the sound is dialed up to eleven, and I’m sure you’ll have a great time. With that out of the way, I want to talk about Jaume Collet-Serra, who has made genre-defining horror films like “House of Wax” and “Orphan.” Although the film flopped and was panned critically, I’ve watched “Goal II: Living the Dream” at least a dozen times. His collaboration with Liam Neeson has given us “Unknown,” “The Commuter,” “Non-Stop,” and “Run All Night.” “The Shallows” is one of the greatest shark films of all time. And it looks like he has entered a phase where he’ll be collaborating with Dwayne Johnson. But the troubling part of this collaboration is that it isn’t allowing my man Jaume to truly shine. So, I genuinely hope that changes and he returns to the kind of movies he does best (low-budget, tense, cold, and action-packed) while taking Dwayne along with him."
"Feb 23, 2023",negative," The turbulence that has recently shaken up the success of Warner Bros. Discovery has threatened to watch their entertainment empire fall after troubles stack upon one another. Between the massive changes made with the streaming service HBO Max, the Batgirl cancelation followed by the DC Extended Universe redirection, and the number of controversies that keep the leading cast in Warner Bros. Discovery projects has remained to be unfavorable for the studio's reputation.  The DC Extended Universe has yet to secure a consistent cinematic universe despite attempts to reapproach the model through different creative perspectives headlined with the comic book publisher's most famous names. 15 years after its initial announcement, Black Adam reiterates that it isn't time that has taken a toll on the DC Extended Universe, but the lack of consistent quality.  Black Adam knows somewhat what it wants from Dwayne Johnson as the titular anti-hero, though it feels like it's filling its picture-per-rate deals with remaining cast members. There's a distinct lack of chemistry between the freshly-assembled Justice Society of America, who introduce themselves on a flimsy script. They're deprived of any meaningful substance, spitting out one-liners that fail to land.  The balance between an effortless sense of cool while yearning for a sense of humor falls completely flat, leaving the film to be simply unfunny.  The humorless, hollow screenplay doesn't exactly know how to handle itself as it wants to grasp the intensity of more dramatic superhero pieces that have proceeded it while tackling the comedic beats that made Shazam! so successful. The overall aimlessness of Black Adam  - feeling lost in its narrative guided by misdirection - warns Warner Bros. Discovery and their DC FIlm team that CGI-ed mass destruction is not enough to save an effort to rebuild a brand.  Accusations against the DC Extended Universe for misusing its characters have been given a new victim as the superficiality of Black Adam contradicts any signs of progression for the studio. Foundationally, it's a showcase of wonderless ancestral superhero storytelling, without much of a story to support itself on. It strips itself down to the bare-boned and uninspired ""good vs. bad"" while marketed as an elaborate forthcoming of the DC Extended Universe's next phase. Black Adam primarily displays how DC has built its mainline live-action universe from the outside in: depending on high-volume talent to attach themselves to projects before taking the steps to craft a comprehensive work of fiction. There's a great disregard for audience expectations, needs, or desires by instead offering an expensive-looking excuse for an origin story. A villain, or primary antagonist, has the fluidity to take any form; emotional, physical, mental, or metaphorical. Black Adam's Sabbac barely makes his way into the film, whose takedown mirrors a high-rendered video game cutscene. Sabbac's late-stage introduction in Black Adam does not justify the ill timing of his arrival. It only strains an already-thin plot. Perhaps Black Adam's greatest strength is its post-credits scene, which features a thrilling cameo that promises to delight DC fans. The grand reveal is credited to Johnson's doing and might be his greatest contribution to the DC Extended Universe yet. 4/10. "
"Feb 19, 2023",positive," Comic book movie fans unfortunately soak every big budget adaptation release in a cloak of greatness before they are even released, and “Black Adam” is no different. Led by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, this unique anti-hero in the DCEU universe is meant to make a quick imprint on the world of superhumans, if the legions of comic book mega nerds can allow it to breathe. A movie that has been many years in the making takes a big swing with its launch this past weekend, and I’m here to tell you if director Jaume Collet-Serra and his larger-than-life star were successful, or is this another Warner Brothers-built tower of eye-rolling boredom? “Born out of rage,” Johnson’s Teth Adam grew up a slave in Kahndaq, a fictional country embedded with tyrant, rule-making mercenaries. Cue the chunky, rushed backstory retelling the film begins the film with. In this very early setting, the mercs ruled over the poor slaves and enlist them in the mines searching for an ancient yet powerful resource called eternium. This gives rulers of Kahndaq unchecked power and abilities, which is where young Adam comes into play. In a desperate attempt to help his people, young Adam makes a bold attempt to capture the attention of the gods, making a wish of sorts that takes him from feeble young teen to fierce god with the saying of a single word, “Shazam!” But bigger muscles and unlimited powers can still yield dangerous results for heroes, villains, and the ones stuck in between like Adam. Sound familiar? Suffice to say, Adam has a monstrous grudge brewing beneath the layers of concrete many decades later when a group of locals go looking for a magical crown. The search lands them in a dark cave where nothing good happens, and what you were looking for becomes something else. The locals run into mercs, and they all eventually awaken a pissed off Adam. Chaos ensues. “Black Adam” gets a lot more fun when the backstory finishes and the big fella breaks out to play. The Justice Society (we’ll get to them later) gets called into play, and every bad guy in Kahndaq and anywhere close is dispatched to either find the crown or take out Adam. The interesting thing here is Adam isn’t playing for the good guys or the bad folks; he’s a highly dangerous man apart at the outset. This unusual dynamic allows audiences to see a different side of Johnson, who gets to play something other than a pure hero for the first time in a good while. This isn’t your “San Andreas” and “Walking Tall” good hearted dude; Collet-Serra aggressively flips the charisma pancake on its side with this iteration of Johnson, who he has worked with a lot over their respective careers. Seeing The Rock roast a merc all the way down to the bone and mush is exactly what I wanted to see him do in his role. Break bad, go for it, and don’t half-ass the role of a guy who spends the entire movie ruminating on whether or not to save the universe or burn it all down. It’s easily his most complete performance, because he has to dip his feet in antagonistic waters while giving off the notion that his anti-hero hasn’t been swallowed full by the dark side. You still see Johnson doing his thing and making magic out of a one-liner, but it’s a different angle for fans. Seeing all the hard work he put in and the challenge of taking up a role in a much ridiculed world, I tip my cap to him for the effort. He has some good support. It’s an equal thrill to see Pierce Brosnan and Aldis Hodge step into the world of superheroes as Kent “Dr. Fate” Nelson and Carter “Hawkman” Hall, respectively. As two of the four opposing forces of the Justice Society of America tasked with taking down a reckless Adam, the pair give solid performances that heighten the material, and nothing more. Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo put in good work as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, the younger members of the team that is easily WAY cooler than The ego-infested Justice League. The story may seem like standard procedure, but the screenplay does have a few jewels packed within. One of them is a riff on gunslingers and spaghetti westerns, as Adam employs an Eastwood trick he watched on television with a band of goons. The soundtrack and Lorne Balfe’s score keep the energy flowing amid adventures and showdowns, but the unkempt pacing keeps the two hour film from feeling too long. Johnson wanted to reshape the hierarchy in the DCEU universe, but he really just helped make a highly entertaining and fun movie instead. One that doesn’t ask too much of its audience, delivers the needed hits with aplomb, and leaves you wanting more in the end. It’s not a masterpiece, but it really didn’t have to be. If comic book fans can check their ambitions for “Black Adam” at the door, they can enjoy this rousing flick that doesn’t take itself too seriously. “Black Adam” is NOT all doom and gloom, thankfully. It’s not a dark dread of hollowed stoicism. It has a tongue placed firmly in its cheek and a sly sense of humor, never allowing the movie to get too light or dark; just the right amount of entertainment and humor. One thing it does produce is unexpected emotion with its characters, which is not always a slam dunk in a comic book take. Like last year’s rollicking “Suicide Squad,” “Black Adam” has its own brand of action and fun, one that worked very well for me–a fella with high expectations due to the Rock at the center."

"Jan 20, 2023",negative," Warner Bros’ slow, tortured mishandling of its DC Comics characters continues with Jaume Collet-Serra’s Black Adam. Dwayne Johnson was confirmed to play the titular anti-hero all the way back in 2014 (having circled the property since late 2006) and the confused and inconsistent mess that has emerged is typical of an over-developed production. Maybe there was a coherent film being developed at some point, but those days are long gone. Black Adam reeks with the stench of too many executives pissing in the punch to make it taste better for too many years. 5,000 years after he was granted the powers of the gods, Teth-Adam (Johnson) is resurrected in modern-day Kahndaq – a Middle-Eastern state controlled by the criminal organisation Intergang. His arrival is met by the Justice Society – Dr Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) – who have arrived to capture Adam and prevent him from threatening the world. As a lifelong fan of DC Comics, it was a joy to see Hawkman and Dr Fate in a big-budget feature film. Both characters were well realised, and solidly performed by Hodge and Brosnan. It is worth getting that praise out of the way up-front, because there is nothing else in the film to recommend. The screenplay is generic and lazy, plotted to hit action sequences rather than to tell an interesting story. It has a poor handle on its title character, who originated as a villain for Captain Marvel (aka Shazam) but who is very tenuously linked to that hero’s movie adaptation. It makes a superficial effort to make some sort of political statement about how superheroes tend to fight giant robots and psychic alien starfish when they could be liberating oppressed developing nations from criminal regimes – but fails to understand that acknowledging this problem tends to make superhero narratives collapse. On top of that it does not to engage with the issue even after it has raised it – the occupying Intergang regime is effectively ignored once computer-generated demon arrives on the scene. There is also the issue of making a superhero protagonist an Arabic man – which is in itself a bold, laudable move – but then casting a Hawaiian in the role. It honestly does not quite know what to do with Black Adam himself. He is a powerful ancient being when the script remembers that he is. At other times, generally random ones, he may as well be from 21st century Los Angeles. Within 20 minutes he is practising catch phrases with his young human sidekick. Adam is presented as an amoral and violent figure, and it is certainly impressed on the audience that he must be stopped, but then his story is also packed with comedic bits about accidentally murdering criminals and henchmen. Johnson’s flat performance does not help: he just feels like the Rock, wrestling superstar, wearing a superhero outfit. Once again it just seems lazy. So do the computer-generated effects, that are over-used to the point of stupidity. They give everything a weirdly fake sheen. It all seems entirely artificial, and therefore dramatically meaningless. Lorne Balfe’s musical score ticks the standard boxes of the effects-driven blockbuster, although he appears to have unintentionally duplicated Ron Grainer’s theme to The Prisoner (a 1967 TV series) in the process. An early action sequences misuses the Rolling Stone’s “Paint It Black” in a stupefying manner. The DCEU is in sorry shape, following years of indecision, poor story choices, and a relentless obsession with grim, gritty takes on the most frivolous of heroes. Producers James Gunn and Peter Safran were recently hired to reboot and rework the entire extended franchise, and goodness knows the characters need it. This film – situated partway between a vanity project and a stealth bid to rework DC – is definitely not the way to do it."
"Jan 14, 2023",negative," BLACK ADAM (2022). While DC might have produced the best superhero saga of 2022 with The Batman (take that, Marvel!), it was also responsible for the worst with Black Adam (take that, DC!). Dwayne Johnson plays the titular character, a god-like figure who is awakened from his 5,000-year slumber and finds himself in the modern world. Since his demeanor and destructive ways make him appear to be a villain rather than a hero, the members of the Justice Society, including Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), are determined to bring him down. There was chatter that, thanks largely to an anti-hero at its center, this 11th entry in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe) was going to mark a departure and possibly a new direction for the franchise, but where’s the evidence? Black Adam is as boring as Man of Steel, as overstuffed as Justice League (both cuts), as visually clunky as Aquaman, and (almost) as stupid as Suicide Squad. It feels much longer than its 125 minutes, and it manages what I previously believed to be impossible: It takes the perennially appealing Dwayne Johnson and strips him of all charisma and personality, transforming him from a dynamic screen presence into a celluloid eunuch. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include pieces on the histories of Black Adam and the Justice Society; featurettes focusing on the visual effects, sets, and costume designs; and a look at the character of Black Adam. THE DUNWICH HORROR (1970). This adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft story proves to be a great disappointment, its reputation as a minor cult item notwithstanding. In the town of Arkham, Massachusetts, the mysterious Wilbur Whateley (Dean Stockwell, two parts dull, one part hammy) enlists the unwitting aid of college student Nancy Wagner (Sandra Dee, two parts dull, one part befuddled) in his plan to call forth cosmic demons. Meanwhile, who (or what) is lurking behind a locked door at the Whateley estate? The animated opening credits sequence is arguably the liveliest part of a leadenly paced picture that grows less gripping as it moseys along. At least the supporting cast is capable: Ed Begley (an Oscar winner for Sweet Bird of Youth) as a professor well-versed in the occult, veteran character actor Sam Jaffe (The Scarlet Empress, The Asphalt Jungle) as Wilbur’s panicky grandfather, and Rocky‘s Talia Shire (here billed under her maiden name, Talia Coppola) as an ill-fated nurse. One of the scripters was future L.A. Confidential Oscar winner Curtis Hanson — this marked his first screen credit. Blu-ray extras include a two-hour conversation about the film and Lovecraft between film historian Stephen R. Bissette and horror author Stephen Laws; a look at Les Baxter’s score for the movie; an image gallery; and the theatrical trailer. GROUNDHOG DAY (1993). Upon its original release, Washington Post film critic Desson Howe wrote, “Groundhog Day will never be designated a national film treasure by the Library of Congress. But, in terms of vehicle selection, this is one of the better ones [Bill] Murray has hitched himself to.” Indeed, while critical response was positive and box office was fairly strong ($70 million), nothing suggested that this comedy from writer-director Harold Ramis and co-scripter Danny Rubin would gather steam over time and emerge as one of the most respected comedies of the past 30 years. Yet at the end of the 1990s, the movie found itself on several critics’ lists of the best films of the decade, and, despite Howe’s understandable assertion to the contrary, the Library of Congress’ National Film Preservation Board did add the picture to its prestigious National Film Registry in 2006. Murray is once again cast in the sort of role at which he excels: the lewd, self-centered lout. He’s Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who inexplicably finds himself living the same day over and over again, trapped in a small town during its Groundhog Day celebration. The film offers some cosmic ruminations beneath its comic exterior, and Murray and Andie MacDowell (rarely so relaxed on film) make a surprisingly compatible screen couple. HIGHLANDER (1986). Critically dismissed upon its initial release and failing to recoup its production costs, Highlander found renewed life in the home-video market, resulting in a series of limp sequels, a popular TV series, and guaranteed cult status. Christopher Lambert plays Connor MacLeod, a 16th century Scottish warrior who learns he’s immortal and can only be killed by having his head lopped off. He survives through the centuries, receiving early tutoring from a garrulous Immortal (Sean Connery) and repeatedly butting heads with the most vicious of all Immortals (Clancy Brown). It’s easy to see why many love this picture (great premise, fine action scenes, a score by Queen, a charismatic Connery) but just as easy to see why many despise it (chintzy production values, stone-faced Lambert, ludicrous supporting characters, thudding dialogue). The 4K UHD edition contains the Director’s Cut that runs approximately five minutes longer than the theatrical version. Extras include audio commentary by director Russell Mulcahy; a making-of featurette; deleted scenes; interviews with Mulcahy, Lambert, and Brown; and a piece on the soundtrack. MISSING IN ACTION TRILOGY (1984-1988). For those so inclined, here’s a new box set containing all three Vietnam War yarns produced by Cannon Films and starring Chuck “Missing in Acting” Norris. Missing in Action (1984) seems like such a blatant rip-off of Rambo: First Blood Part II that it’s easy to forget that the Norris vehicle actually came first. But it’s also easy to overlook the fact that Missing in Action was inspired by the Rambo script that had been making the rounds, and it was indeed hustled into production and into theaters in an effort to beat the Stallone starrer (which kicked off the summer of 1985). Not surprisingly, both films are of equal value: mindless mediocrities in which one lone American soldier returns to Vietnam years after the war in an effort to rescue the POWs still being held captive. In MiA, it’s Colonel James Braddock, who had himself escaped from one of these illicit camps and now seeks to expose the Vietnamese government’s cover-up by producing more illegally detained prisoners. Norris devotees rank this one highly; others might not be as charitable. The following year found Norris headlining one of his better pictures — unfortunately for Missing in Action 2: The Beginning (1985), that would be Code of Silence. The second MiA flick is actually the first in a chronological sense, a prequel illustrating the events that transpired while Braddock was still a POW and how he subsequently managed his great escape. While still falling squarely in the average category, I do prefer this one by a smidgen over its predecessor, due to Norris being supported by actual characters among the POWs and not just cardboard stand-ups. And while all the Vietnamese villains in this trilogy are one-note caricatures, Soon-tek Oh makes his memorably sadistic. Plus, ya gotta love the “Chuck Norris meme”-worthy scene in which a rat employed for torture gets tortured itself by our hero. Showing no shame, Norris and Cannon Films blatantly copied Rambo: First Blood Part II by giving the third film a similarly styled title with Braddock: Missing in Action III (1988) — yes, they even shifted from the numerical 2 to the Roman III to make the steal complete. Yet the end result is so wretched, it makes the Stallone flick look as accomplished as The Bridge on the River Kwai by comparison. Co-written by Chucky and directed by his brother Aaron (the Frank to his Sylvester), this one finds America’s greatest export returning to Vietnam to rescue the wife (Miki Kim) he didn’t realize was still alive and the son (Roland Harrah III) he didn’t know he had sired. Chuck Norris movies generally weren’t kind to female characters (or black characters, for that matter) — the death of the most sympathetic (and most brutalized) person is a tasteless sequence that stands out in the midst of all this juvenile jingoism, but the whole movie operates at a junky level. Hilariously, the primary villain (Aki Aleong) seemingly screams “Braddock!” even more often than the Skipper bellowed “Gilligan!” over the three-season run of Gilligan’s Island and Ricky howled “Lucy!” over I Love Lucy’s six seasons. Each movie in this Blu-ray box set includes audio commentary (director Joseph Zito on the first, director Lance Hool on the second, and film historians on the third) and the theatrical trailer; the original MiA also offers an interview with scripter James Bruner. WARGAMES (1983). The summer of ’83 provided director John Badham a couple of opportunities to score, as he had two high-profile films opening within three weeks of each other. Blue Thunder earned only moderately good reviews and a middling box office take of $42 million (a shame, as it’s quite entertaining), but WarGames opened to rave reviews and enjoyed a robust $79 million gross. Matthew Broderick (in only his second movie in only his first year in film) stars as a teenage computer hacker who believes he’s playing a game called Global Thermonuclear War when in actuality he has tapped into the U.S. Department of Defense and is about to inadvertently start World War III. WarGames was a relevant picture not only in the manner in which it largely introduced the bold new world of computers to the masses but also because it led to politicians drafting legislation inspired by its cautionary warnings. It’s a clever if occasionally far-fetched adventure-thriller, buoyed by winning turns from Broderick and fellow newbie Ally Sheedy. One of the top grossing films of 1983 — it was #5 for the year, just under the Eddie Murphy comedy Trading Places and just above the 007 entry Octopussy — it grabbed Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay (Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes), Best Cinematography, and Best Sound. WARNING SHOT (1967). David Janssen’s greatest claim to fame was playing Dr. Richard Kimble in the hit TV series The Fugitive (1963-1967). It’s therefore amusing that Warning Shot, a movie he made while still active with the show, was promoted with the tagline, “…the shot that made him a fugitive.” Here he plays Tom Valens, an LA cop forced to fatally shoot a man in self-defense. The stranger turns out to be a highly respected doctor and philanthropist, and, even more damning, no gun is found on the scene. Valens is therefore brought up on manslaughter charges, meaning he has to locate and thereby prove the existence of said revolver. Like 1964’s The Killers (aka Ronald Reagan’s final film), Warning Shot was made for television (one telltale sign being that the production company, Bob Banner Associates, worked exclusively on boob-tube fare) but was instead released theatrically due to its violence. It’s great fun in any medium, with a mystery that only grows too obvious in the second half. Adding to the merriment — and the TV Land roots — is the army of “guest stars” who appear throughout: All About Eve Oscar winner George Sanders, silent-screen legend Lilian Gish, Ed Begley (see also The Dunwich Horror, above), Joan Collins, a pre-Archie Bunker Carroll O’Connor, and more."

"Jan 2, 2023",positive," Once COVID hit, things simmered down for a while but as everything goes back to normal, both studios are offering their latest fare.  Unfortunately, that has included some not-so-great films in the last year and a half and DC's newest release, Black Adam, is unfortunately included.  Starring Dwayne Johnson (The Jungle Cruise), it is coming to 4K,  Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD to help ring in the New Year. In the Middle Eastern land of Khandaq, King Ahk-Ton ruled with an iron fist, forcing the Council of Wizards to give a young, slave boy the powers of Shazam.  Throughout the centuries, he became a legend as the heroic savior of their land.  In present-day, Khandaq, the intergang oppresses the people until the day archeologist, Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi; Alias) awakens the hero, Teth-Adam/Black Adam (Johnson) to fight the evil tyrants. However, The Justice Society - Hawkman (Aldis Hodge; Hidden Figures), Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan; Goldeneye), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo; The Fosters), and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell; Voyagers) - is sent to prevent Black Adam from destroying Khandaq...again. It is obvious why Johnson was cast in the title role.  He is a HUGE box office draw, can portray an extremely menacing character, and would be believable as an ancient superhero.  Unfortunately, he isn't the strongest of actors and he is so muscular he looks slightly grotesque in his costume.  Monetarily it's obvious why they cast him, but they could have picked a better actor if they were going for quality. Hodge, Centineo, and Swindell offer some credibility but Brosnan steals the show. As the elder statesman of the society, he brings an air of calmness to chaotic battle scenes and imparts wisdom with a British accent (even though he is Irish by birth).  Like another British elder in a competing superhero Universe, Brosnan offers sophistication among the younger members of the team.  Casting him was a smart choice that paid off in the finished product. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment division brings Black Adam to stores to start off 2023 with a band (or a lightning bolt if you prefer).  The 2160p high-definition video is exceptionally well done with only minor moments where the CGI is evident.  Otherwise, the details are sharp and clean which is often difficult to achieve with movies that rely on a number of special effects. The Dolby Atmos audio has a great deal of ambient noise throughout and the dialogue and soundtrack are both crisp and robust offering the viewer a fully immersive experience.  The 60-plus minutes of extras are only available on the Blu-ray Disc and include: The History of Black Adam, Who is the Justice Society?, From Soul to Screen, Black Adam: A Flawed Hero, Black Adam: New Tech Old World, Black Adam: Taking Flight, Khandaq: Designing a Nation, The ROCK of Eternity, Costumes Make the Hero, and Black Adam: A New Type of Action.  DC Comics has been competing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe for over ten years, with each franchise cranking out movie after movie in order to claim box-office superiority.   Sadly, DC usually lags behind the MCU on the movie front and Black Adam continues that streak.  Amazingly good video, directing,  special effects, and excellent audio quality can't make up for a strong plot. I'm not sure if the recent firings at DC Comics will bring freshness to the franchise but it couldn't hurt to try.  While it is sad to see such great actors like Henry Cavill (Mission: Impossible - Fallout) and Gal Gadot (Death on the Nile) lose their roles as superheroes,  a reboot might just be what the DCEU needs.

"Jan 2, 2023",negative," If there's one thing you have to admire about the filmmakers at DC Studios, it's the persistence to keep going despite a rather dreadful track record. They press on in the hopes of being able to churn out something with the same quality as ""Shazam!"" or better yet, ""The Suicide Squad"" (and with James Gunn now in co-command, hopefully that's exactly what will happen). As if a good DC superhero film wasn't already difficult enough to develop, the filmmakers behind ""Black Adam,"" their latest outing, decided to make it even harder by casting Dwayne Johnson in the lead. Will their persistence be nearly enough to stop DC's latest endeavor from being yet another disaster to add to the list? Teth Adam immediately comes to the attention of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who dispatches the ""Justice Society"" (Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo)) to bring him in. An epic battle ensues, but a new enemy is soon revealed, one who wants to obtain the Crown and literally release hell on Earth, forcing an unlikely alliance in an effort to stop this from happening. When it comes to ""Black Adam,"" there really isn't any beating around the bush. It's your very typical, standard DC outing that seems to have had very little thought put into any of its most important elements. You have a plethora of characters that are remarkably unengaging and sadly under-developed, all trapped within a cliched plot that features absolutely nothing that we haven't already seen before in the multitude of other superhero movies. And so, with no three-dimensional characters to connect with, and a story whose plotpoints anyone could lay out in their entirety in the first 30 minutes of the film, you can begin to imagine what the experience of sitting through it is like. That said, the film has yet another major issue that, while it may not be as detrimental as the film's weak plot & characters, still hinders it in a very significant fashion. Typically, when you go to see a Dwayne Johnson film, you already know in advance that the aforementioned elements won't exactly be top-notch, but even so, you can usually count on Johnson being his usual self. That is to say, he tends to be a very charismatic actor who's rather fun to watch, even if the film he's in is falling apart all around him. So as to how anyone at DC thought it was a good idea to take him, completely drain him of all that charisma, and let him sleepwalk through a major film like this is one of those inexplicable questions that will likely never receive an answer. Suffice it to say that it was indeed one of the absolute worst ideas anyone could have proposed and carried out, for featuring an emotionless Dwayne Johnson only serves to further diminish what little excitement the film has. By the end, we find that the film has had very little to offer in the way of entertainment value, making the supposed 15-year journey to bring this to the screen appear to be in vain. One would think that, if it really did take that long to develop, then a lot more serious consideration would have gone into its most vital components. There would've been an exciting story to get swept up in, and intriguing characters to root for, instead of a cacophonous mess that aims for the bare minimum in both departments. ""Black Adam"" could've been a fun, thrilling experience if the filmmakers had cared enough to put the effort in where it counts, but unfortunately they did not, leaving us with yet another DC comic book outing that evaporates the second it's over. ""Black Adam"" arrives on Blu-ray in a 2.39:1, 1080p High Definition transfer of excellent quality. The image is sharp and clear throughout the entire two-hour runtime, highlighting the film's extensive visual effects work and designs. Likewise, the Dolby Atmos-TrueHD audio track is very solid, giving you all of the dialogue, sound effects, and score in outstanding quality. Overall, like most Warner Bros. releases, there are no complaints to be had in either area. The plentiful extras include ten featurettes, totaling a little over an hour, focusing on various behind the scenes aspects of the film, such as the characters, costumes, setting, and action sequences.  With its uninspired narrative, paper-thin characters, and an uncharacteristically uncharismatic Dwayne Johnson, ""Black Adam"" merely presents yet another DC dud that fails to excite, entertain, or even remotely engage."
"Jan 2, 2023",neutral," The state of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is hard to pin down because every few months something else shifts. Each release thus far has its supporters and its detractors, but the one consistent thing is that the fans are hungry to see DC Comics characters on the big screen in a recreation of tales that only jumped off the page in our imagination. Between the business and personal issues, the separation within the fandom, and the will they/won’t they appear again nature of the original Zack Snyder-hired cast, it’s difficult for anyone to get particularly excited about any new DCEU project. But then the first trailer for Black Adam, the Dwayne Johnson-led project with Aldis Hodge (Leverage), Pierce Bronson (Goldeneye), and Sarah Shahi (Life) in supporting roles, and things looked like they were going to change. The audience was going to be given a project with a lead who takes no prisoners, suffers no fools, and, essentially, poses the greatest threat to Earth since the arrival of Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciarán Hinds) in 2017’s Justice League or 2021’s Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Unfortunately, what the audience receives is so by-the-numbers that even the most die-hard superhero fan will struggle to find a reason to view the film more than once. In the country of Kahndaq, criminal organization Intergang runs everything that comes in and out, making as much money as they can in their quest to harvest a mineral known as eternium. Trying to combat Intergang and what she fears is their real motivation for mining Kahndag is former university professor Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) who, along with her brother Karim (Mohammed Amer) and son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), stumbles onto a discovery that possesses the power to change the hierarchy of power not only in Kahndaq but in the entire world: she awakens legendary hero Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson). L-R: Sarah Shahi as Adrianna and Mohammed Amer as Karim in New Line Cinema’s action adventure BLACK ADAM, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. © 2022 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved. Writing reviews, especially for home releases when the film has been out for a while, it’s nearly impossible to have your perception of the film not be influenced, even minimally. While all reviewers possess their own subjective view, having knowledge of how a film has been performing and how that film has been received by audiences and other film critics will, to some degree, shape your consideration of it. Black Adam is a great example, because when a film like this is hyped so profusely prior to release and then not only flounders, but basically gets cut-off at the knees due to a combination of audience response and an overhaul in division management at the studio, it’s impossible to experience the film without all of that context. Thus it would be irresponsible to examine the film without this context, to some degree. As someone who grew up on DC Comics, the prospect of seeing any character, hero or villain, grace the screen small or large is an absolute treat. Unfortunately, the run-up to the Dwayne Johnson-led Black Adam was marred before it even hit production thanks to the bungling of Warner Bros. Pictures in their handling of (first) the DC Extended Universe and then (second) the sale to money-centric CEO David Zaslav, who has undermined the creative side of WB Pictures since taking the reins. Considering Johnson’s magnetism on screen and his seemingly unstoppable enthusiasm for the project, Black Adam seemed destined to do as the former WWE star said, and change the hierarchy of power in the DCEU. Sadly, the Jaume Collet-Serra-directed (Jungle Cruise) superhero tale doesn’t set anything alight, let alone create an ember from which a flame could arise. The film merely exists, feeling like a throwback to the cape films of the 1990s when logic was little and jokes aplenty. While this works in films like Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), it all but diminishes what should be a powerful exploration of power (who has it vs. who wants it), what it means to wield that power, and the cost that comes with it. That seems to be the film Black Adam aspires to be when one looks at the ideas within, yet it’s so intent on creating literal blockbusting action sequences that all of the good stuff gets lost in the rubble. Let’s look at two examples from the script by Adam Sztykiel (Scoob!), Rory Haines (The Mauritanian), and Sohrab Noshirvani (The Mauritanian) in terms of solid ideas left to fall by the wayside and interesting ideas that are uninspired in their execution. The first comes in the form of Adrianna’s necklace, briefly mentioned when we meet her and Karim, and noted as being a family heirloom. This necklace is seen in the flashbacks as being worn by Teth Adam’s wife, creating the implication that the newly awakened powerhouse and the woman who freed him are related. The script seeks to create pathos through the notion that Teth failed his family, his son specifically, so with Adrianna and her family comes an opportunity to make amends. Maybe it’s something that was to be explored in a follow-up, but with the hiring of James Gunn and Peter Safran to reframe the DCEU moving forward combined with the lackluster public response to Black Adam, it’s less likely that a sequel will happen anytime soon, if at all. The problem, then, is that the script, as it exists, decides to ignore this familial connection in favor of, instead, using a more fish-out-of-water approach where Amon guides Teth through the modern world, teaching him about jokes, catchphrases, and all the things the man from over 5,000 years ago may not know. Teth doesn’t really take to the boy until well into the film, the script working super hard to sell the audience on the mystery of Teth and the legend of him as the hero of Kahndaq. By shunting this small detail, the film could’ve shortcut a lot of the struggle to get Teth to trust Adrianna, to bond with Amon, and allow the script to focus more on the Sabbac storyline that more-or-less feels like an excuse to get Teth to team-up with Hodges’s Hawkman and the Justice Society rather than to have an actual fight over what it means to be a hero and the ethics involved in that. It’s an opportunity squandered, likely made because the creators think they are giving the audience what it wants (bombast), when what they really want is a reason to be invested. Sabbac is the interesting idea that succumbs to the “protagonist cape must fight inversed version of themselves to win the day” trope. Venom fights Riot (constructed in-universe to be stronger and bigger than Venom), Kal-El fights Zod, Batman fights The Riddler or Joker, and The Flash goes up against Zoom. To this end, Teth should actually fight Shazam (or Captain Marvel, iykyk), which is mentioned in the bonus features as the original idea, but that was scrapped in favor of giving Teth his own film first. As a result, Shazam fought Doctor Sivana, who was portrayed as just a ruined version of Billy Batson, and Teth Adam was put up against both the Justice Society and Sabbac, one with the opposing ethical code and the other the strength the match him. In the comics, Sabbac has taken the form in different people, each one imbued with powers that are fueled by Hell demons that give the individual abilities to rival Shazam. In the script, both King Ahk-Ton of the past and Ishmael of the present (both played by Marwan Kenzari) seek out a mineral to create a crown which will grant the wearer the powers of Sabbac. First, far as my research shows, there is no eternium and the use of it here reeks of how adamantium was used in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) as a means to erase Logan’s memory. It’s simplistic, unimaginative, and serves as little more than a shortcut rather than taking inspiration from the decades of comics that precede the film. The film could’ve taken the stance that power granted by wizards is little more than a shortcut negating any victory, or that this kind of power, however given, corrupts the bearer, yet it refuses to do any kind of interrogation at all. It dances around it as Hawkman and Teth argue, it hints at it as Hawkman finds himself getting yelled at by the people of Kahndaq who see him as just another outsider imposing his views on them, and it suggests it when the reveal comes that Teth was never the intended champion of the Wizards of the Rock of Eternity and is, therefore, a false idol himself. The film is dripping with possibilities that would have made for both engaging entertainment and philosophy, but, instead, we get lots of slo-mo, racist cinematography (why’s everything blown out to look yellow/orange in Khandaq?), and plenty of punchy-punchy smashy-smashy.

Perhaps the saddest thing about the home release (and this is where the bittersweetness comes in strong) is not just the number of on-disc materials and details, but the way they are approached. For instance, Sarah Shadi actually hosts the “History of Black Adam” featurette and Aldis Hodge hosts “Who is The Justice Society?,” each one given the production value and energy from the host that implies a certain expectation that this wasn’t going to be a oner. With each accompanying featurette, the home viewing audience is reminded of the great work that went into the film, on screen and off, and how we’ll be lucky if we get to see any one from this film on-screen in some capacity again. There are no deleted scenes or gag reels (the latter being a proper bummer as the featurettes indicate that this crew had a blast making the film), but with nearly two hours of bonus materials covering everything from character history to costume design to production design, for those who either enjoyed the adventure or just love to know more about filmmaking, there’s plenty to make one happy about the purchase. Earlier in this write-up I mentioned that it’s difficult for a reviewer who comes to a film late not to notice what happens around a film. I think it’s also important to note that a reviewer should also only review the film in front of them, not the one they wanted. The issue here is that the script sets up a great deal that it refuses to pay off on and utilizes shortcuts that benefit no one but the characters. This results in a lack of general investment or interest, everything falling to who the audience is told to root for versus who they come to believe in. Now, I’m a longtime fan of Johnson’s and will belly up to the table when he signs onto a project. He’s got chops and charisma, and this role is a natural fit for him. It’s an absolute shame that the film around him didn’t utilize him to its fullest, because Black Adam can be a meaty and complex role for an actor willing to walk the line. It’s a shame that we may never see what comes next because, in a sequel, maybe he’d feel free enough to go for broke. Well, this is just disappointing. I was really looking forward to BAvS but Gunn seems to have no interest in making that film. Black Adam could have been pulled into the Shazam universe. So much they could do. Sigh. With the poor management of the connected universe thus far, the total clean sweep of material isn’t too surprising. Especially for things that have not hit strongly with audiences. That’s why I’m not shocked that “The Suicide Squad” and “Peacemaker” are rumored to be sticking around as those did well, whereas most of the rest have not. Plus, add in no Patty Jenkins for “WW3,” it’s less likely that Gadot would stick around.  Personally, I think too much blame is going on Gunn and Saffron and not enough on WB Management. They are just hired guns coming in to play with toys. I’m just bitter they are getting rid of Cavill and, for the love of sanity, keeping Ezra Miller? That makes no sense to me. Keep the man who is adored by fans and just drop the guy with federal charges against him.  Can appreciate the frustration. Between the complications that arose during the filming and reception of “Justice League,” plus COVID and the WB buy, Cavill got the short stick on a lot of things.  Got nothing to explain standing by “The Flash.” Of all the things to scrap, that would be the project given what’s going on with Miller. "
"Dec 29, 2022",negative,"It’s a slog to sit through, a painfully dull, and lackluster superhero movie that can never decide if its titular character is a superhero or a villain in the making..."
"Dec 27, 2022",negative," We look back at the year’s best releases and its most terrible turkeys. From Top Gun: Maverick to Bodies Bodies Bodies. Does your favourite film make it onto the list? ‘We are revolting children, living in revolting times!’ Tim Minchin’s genius lyrics make this a smash hit, with Alisha Weir, for all ages. See you at the singalong version, out in cinemas January 1. The most brilliantly bananas movie of 2022 absolutely lives up to its title. Michelle Yeoh kicks all types of ass as a time-travelling laundromat manager in a multiverse of madness. Burnished 1980s blockbuster nostalgia as Tom Cruise and producer Jerry Bruckheimer prove they can still make ’em like they used to. Strap in for the thrillingly real aerial dog fights.  National treasure Bill Nighy finally gets his shot at Oscars glory as a repressed civil servant in this immaculate British drama, penned by Sir Kazuo Ishiguro. Whodunnits are back with a vengeance. This inspired slasher twist boasts a thrilling satirical energy and a sizzling Gen Z cast, including Amandla Stenberg and Borat’s Maria Bakalova. Big winner at this year’s British Independent Film Awards, this indie gem casts Paul Mescal (Normal People) as a dad holidaying with his 11-year-old daughter (knockout Frankie Corio).  The British auteur Andrea Arnold (Fish Tank) turns to documentary with this powerful, cow’s eye view of the dairy industry. You may never look a pint of milk in the face again. This soulful sequel teams an emotional tribute to late star Chadwick Boseman with some spectacular visual action. A maturity milestone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starring Angela Bassett and Winston Duke.  Even the rock-solid charisma of Dwayne Johnson rolls off a cliff with this noisy and disappointingly boring load of CGI-laden superhero tosh. A DCU fail."
"Dec 22, 2022",negative," A wise DC comics character once noted, “you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” In the case of the DCEU, no one quite fits this bill as aptly as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Once described as “franchise Viagra,” we’ve entered an odd place for the action star. His movies are doing fine at the box office, and his foray into the superhero world is no different. Spinning out of the Shazam! corner of DC, Black Adam sought to bring new life to the universe. However, we are now less than 24 hours after Johnson posted an Instagram message indicating he will leave the franchise. Confronting what does not work about Black Adam is sadly an easy task, and it begins with its star.  For those who missed Black Adam, the plot revolves around an ancient man fighting for freedom against those who enslave him. As the powerful king is about to crown himself with a weapon known as the Crown of Sabbac, Teth-Adam (Johnson) defeats his would-be slavers. However, because he lashed out with his powers, a council of wizards traps Adam in a tomb. Fast forward several millennia, and Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi), an archeologist, stumbles upon the resting place of the Crown of Sabbac. When mercenaries attempt to obtain the crown, Adrianna accidentally awakens Teth-Adam. The stir causes the Justice Society, led by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan) to intervene before Adam becomes unstoppable.  Johnson physically fits the part, and that has never been the problem facing the movie star. Instead, Johnson has simply lost the sheen that allowed him to thrive as a star. Every aspect of Black Adam comes across as a vanity project, instead of the film he’s longed to make. Nothing about Adam is approaching normalcy. In fact, he is so absurdly overpowered, it is impossible to stop him, even for a group of heroes with a varied skillset. This all might work if Johnson was playing a character audience were familiar with before the film.  However, Adam is anything but mainstream. Despite some recent comics focused on Black Adam, he has largely been an antagonist for Shazam. Instead, audiences are getting their first exposure to his godlike power, with no stakes or antagonists that will even make him sweat. This is not someone we inherently feel sorry for or have sympathy for. Instead, Black Adam attempts to create a big twist, which fails horribly in its execution. What’s worse is Black Adam‘s unwillingness to let anyone besides Johnson take center stage. Much of the action revolves around his T2 inspired story (where a young boy teaches Adam the difference between doing the right thing versus the wrong thing). Hodge and Brosnan show their own star qualities, but are almost entirely subserviant to Johnson throughout the film. When they are not literally bending over backwards to take his one-liners, they are often relegated to the background.  The visual styling of Black Adam does little to make the film a fun experience. We’ve seen dozens of CG battles over the past year, and many have evolved to show more than a man simply punching those who come up against him. Yet Black Adam‘s stunt work and CG effects do little to bring the audience into the story. Director Jaume Collett-Serra seems to be stuck in blockbuster jail, following Johnson from project to project. However, these CG environments lack any tactility, and thus, lack any staying power. It’s a shame to see a talented director lose what made him special working on films like The Shallows.  Worse, Johnson lost his ability to play self-depricating humor a long time ago. If anything, this is the ultimate step in his self-serious phase. Even when other characters try to lighten the mood, he simply smolders at the camera and angrily asks for things to go his way. This is Thor without the humbling, because Black Adam simply cuts through enemies like they’re butter. Without any challenges, we cannot feel for Johnson’s depiction of the character.  However, this is not an issue exclusive to this film or this franchise. Johnson has turned into a something of an unbeatable force in every film. The man once known to play into the joke (as recently as Pain & Gain or Fast Five) has turned that side off. He fashions himself a comedian, but rarely hits the jokes and one-liners. The collaborations with Kevin Hart often involve Hart debasing himself to further show Johnson’s size. There’s no vulnerability on screen anymore from Johnson, and as a result, his career feels micromanaged to death.  Without critical support or audience support, Johnson will approach a crossroads. He can continue to make blockbusters in his sleep, and they will continue to feel like empty calories. There’s a reason that San Andreas, Skyscraper, and Rampage have almost no cultural footprint. However, if Johnson lets go of his ego, he could still reverse course. Working with genuine auteur filmmakers, or at least directors who will challenge him, will extend his career for decades. However, if all Johnson seeks is his quota and his power, he may find himself struggling to make even middling crime films in the next two decades. "
"Dec 2, 2022",positive," Thanksgiving weekend is when the majority of FYC (For Your Consideration) screeners hit my inbox and mailbox, so the rest of this year’s newsletters should be jam-packed. And since Substack won’t stop warning me that I’ve gone over the “email limit” for mirroring the below into your inbox, I apologize for the length. I’m working under the assumption one very long newsletter a week is better than multiple shorter ones clogging your notifications. I’m more or less trying to hit titles in the order of their relevance to the current date whether it be that they’re hitting theaters, becoming available online, etc. That means pushing WOMEN TALKING back a couple weeks to hit BLACK ADAM instead. For better or worse, I figure I should talk about the ones everyone can see now before the ones you can’t. I may sprinkle some in anyway, though, as I’m anxious to finally watch many of those I missed at TIFF. I’ve never been a huge STAR WARS guy. The original films were part of my childhood and I enjoyed the spectacle of seeing them on the big screen upon re-release, as well as attending the prequels, but Disney’s purchase for expanded universe IP earned little more than a shrug. Why? Because it was all the same. Skywalkers threatening and saving the galaxy. We’d seen it all before. That’s why ROGUE ONE left a mark. Was it as good as the franchise’s best, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK? Maybe. Maybe not. It felt fresh either way. Standalone in its action if not its mythology, it was a film dressed with the STAR WARS aesthetic rather than one more example proving STAR WARS is solely synonymous with characters born from George Lucas’ A NEW HOPE. So, it’s no surprise “fans” dislike ANDOR and say it’s not “STAR WARS.” And it’s no surprise it’s also the best thing to come from the series in forty years. Credit Tony Gilroy and company for truly seeing what STAR WARS was always about. Not the Force, but the Struggle. The struggle for freedom from oppression. The war for justice and equality. While we championed heroes who arrived at the eleventh hour to wave their hands, the machine of rebellion turned and provided them the opportunity to become legends years before their arrival. That’s where the real drama is. The boots on the ground espionage setting the stage. And if ROGUE ONE whet that appetite, ANDOR gives it room to breathe. It shows us how a thief can be radicalized into becoming a hero without magic or pedigree. The people, no matter their origins, will rise. Give us the gray area of “good” with Stellan Skarsgård’s Luthen damning his soul and sacrificing his allies to advance the mission. Give us the ambition of “evil” through Denise Gough’s pragmatic opportunist Meero and Kyle Soller’s impulsive opportunist Syril. Add sage wisdom (Fiona Shaw is a scene-stealer as always), gravitas (Andy Serkis supplies a wonderful arc), and tenacity (Genevieve O’Reilly and Faye Marsay might be my favorite characters of the whole as unlikely rebels) and there arise subplots and layers to this complex web that allow it to enthrall no matter who leads an individual scene, episode, or the show itself. For his part, Diego Luna’s Cassian ultimately holds it together. He’s the catalyst, intentionally or not. He proves that the fight is always “ours” rather than “theirs” because it will arrive at “our” doorstep regardless of how far away it seemed beforehand. Every marvelous bit part (Kathryn Hunter’s delightful turn as Syril’s mother is a show-stopper) augments the heavy point-of-no-return atmosphere that a broken society builds until Cassian has no choice but to open his eyes to the truth: his participation was inevitable. I did my best to go in blind with Zach Cregger’s BARBARIAN and, for the most part, I succeeded. Besides knowing Justin Long was in it (which is something to know considering the first forty-two minutes of its one-hour-and-forty-two minute runtime end before he’s seen singing along to the radio in a red convertible), I sat back and waited for the chaos. Because it is chaos. Maybe not as crazy as I was led to believe, but definitely full of out-of-left-field twists and turns. It needs them too considering everything starts rather generically as Tess (Georgina Campbell) and Keith (Bill Skarsgård) discover the owner of their Airbnb double-booked them. Is one of them a killer? Is there something else in the house? Has this whole ordeal been orchestrated by an outside party? Familiar questions with seemingly familiar answers until morning breaks. I don’t want to say too much, but Tess exiting the property in the light of day brings just the first jarring revelation. Cregger is very interested in playing with our preconceptions and shielding details from view long enough to throw them in our face with a sharp cut. But even that isn’t the half of it—not when you still have a monster (Matthew Patrick Davis), overtaxed Detroit police, and misogyny to contend with. Delivering the latter’s messaging with comedy proves somewhat off-putting, but it does also help to keep us off-balance. Does the whole ultimately end up being just another over-the-top horror film? Yes. I was hoping for something fresh rather than freshly disturbing, but I can’t argue I wasn’t entertained. Pick a messed up topic, take it to its most messed up extremes, and drop an innocent in the middle to see what happens. The formula brings nothing new to the table, but the packaging does enough to make you think it has. Oh. And it will never not be funny that I had to go to Disney’s press site to get the above still. That’s what happens when you build a monopoly, I guess. I’ll never really get the hate for DC films. They’re objectively not great and almost without exception worse than most Marvel Cinematic Universe fare, but they’re also fun. You know. Like how comic books are fun. So, if you’re going to drag a movie like BLACK ADAM for no other reason than it’s not CITIZEN KANE, you better drag every MCU installment too. Be consistent. Gatekeep-y, but consistent. That’s not to say Dwayne Johnson’s anti-hero’s origin tale doesn’t have its issues. How could it not when the studio didn’t even want to give the character a standalone until he demanded it from them? So, rather than debut in SHAZAM!, the IP sat on the shelf. Zach Snyder’s dour-verse ended. James Gunn’s irreverence was introduced. And BLACK ADAM was born in the middle. If anything, it should have been an unmitigated disaster. I assumed it would be that by the word of mouth I’d heard. I assumed they’d be milking the whole “is he a hero or villain” thing until the Justice Society became the real bad guys. But that wasn’t the case. They let the conflict be Teth Adam’s alone. Which path would he choose? Hawkman, Dr. Fate, and company were merely there to keep him in check so the people of Kahndaq could help him decide. Jaume Collet-Serra was there to provide a steadying hand like he has during an underrated career of memorable b-movie diversions. The Rock is really good in the film—the straight-man-out-of-time opposite everyone else’s know-it-alls. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan lend legitimacy. Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell lend comic relief. And Sarah Shahi and Bodhi Sabongui lend heart. Add Mohammed Amer’s perfectly timed gags and it’s difficult not to sit back and enjoy the ride. Because it never tries to be more than it is: the origin tale of a superentity that toes the line. Not because he might be evil. Because good isn’t always enough to defeat evil alone. “Never eat an eater.” That’s the advice Sully—the creepy, talks about himself in the third person, wannabe mentor played with panache by Mark Rylance—gives eighteen-year-old Maren upon smelling her from miles away. She had always thought she was the only one who craved human flesh. The only biological cannibal who simply could not control her urges. Sully’s fateful appearance proves otherwise, preparing her for a coming-of-age adventure unfit for happy endings. Based on Camille DeAngelis’ acclaimed novel, BONES AND ALL follows Taylor Russell’s Maren on a cross-country journey to find the mother who left before she could remember. Now that her father (André Holland) has followed suit, unable to keep protecting her when she slips and unable to turn her into the police, this teen has nowhere to go but back to the beginning to try and figure out how to move forward. Luca Guadagnino’s film (adapted by frequent collaborator David Kajganich) works best when it focuses on that quest. Strip away the high-concept horror conceit and this is a poignant search for identity. Unfortunately, however, that conceit is also the draw and thus requires to be taken with the utmost earnestness to the point where it’s practically screaming, “Monsters deserve love too!” I get it. It’s as much a part of this template as anything else, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t feel goofy the moment Maren finds that love with Timothée Chalamet’s Lee. Both leads are very good. Rylance steals the show with his own fight for love and the destructive nature of being without for too long. And Michael Stuhlbarg, Chloë Sevigny, and, yes, director David Gordon Green lend some unforgettable cameos. The gore is subdued with most violence off-screen after the first couple bites or knife slashes (until the climax, which proves much bloodier) and the romance’s heart is surprisingly pure. I just wish I didn’t constantly have to wonder if every other scene wouldn’t have been better as straight farce. Leave it to Vince Vaughn to take the well-worn tropes of your usual Hallmark Christmas movie and drag them through the sex-crazed innuendo of a horny teenager growing up in the 1990s. CHRISTMAS WITH THE CAMPBELLS, co-written and produced by the actor, is pretty much exactly that. Brittany Snow’s Jesse dodges a bullet when Alex Moffat’s Shawn breaks up with her days before the holiday (to help facilitate a new opportunity for “bigger and better” in NYC), but his parents (Julia Duffy and George Wendt) decide to invite her to their quaint little town to celebrate anyway because they consider her part of the family. She meets their rugged nephew David (Justin Long speaking in hokum metaphors Elaine Benes would have written for the J. Peterman Catalog) and starts falling in love just when Shawn suddenly appears unannounced. It plays out exactly how you’d think, complete with JoAnna Garcia Swisher’s Becky diverting both men’s eyes with her “tasty treats.” Jesse gets to hear everyone air their dirty sex laundry; Duffy and Wendt are forced to say “purple drank,” “lean,” and “sizzurp” unironically in the same sequence (when not talking about their overactive libidoes); and we’re reminded how some people will never understand that comedic trends evolve. It’s not easy to tell stories centering a relationship between a Black man and a white man wherein the former is constantly having to teach the latter how not to fly so far beyond anti-racism that he starts adopting the role of white savior as an identity trait. It’s difficult because such depictions can’t help but come off as pandering no matter how earnest the delivery or true to life the events. That director J.D. Dillard and stars Jonathan Majors and Glen Powell are able to allow DEVOTION to speak from the heart despite this reality says volumes. Majors plays Jesse L. Brown, the first Black aviator to complete the U.S. Navy's basic flight training program—an extraordinary feat considering the gauntlet of racially-motivated challenges his character describes throughout the film. Powell plays his wingman Tom Hudner, a Lieutenant transferring into his squadron shortly before they are deployed for real action. None of them have been to “the show” before. Too young to fight in WWII, they wondered if they’d ever do more than drills and exercises when the Korean War begins. They prove up to the task. While the firefights are obviously a draw in a blockbuster such as this, DEVOTION is never better than when it dials things back to portray the dynamics behind the scenes. Whether an impromptu invite to a party at the behest of Elizabeth Taylor or small moments such as Jesse discovering his impact with old acquaintances (Joseph Cross’ ‘Alabama’ Ward) or the Black navalmen on his aircraft carrier who see him as a hero in the sky, Majors shows off his expansive range alongside a never better Powell. The drama can get pretty heavy-handed and expose just how sanitized and corny Hollywood productions are compared to grittier indies, but the emotional impact at its back is undeniable. Ryan White’s GOOD NIGHT OPPY is a cute look back at the lifespan of rovers Spirit and Opportunity. From the initial planning phase (ten years of NASA declining Steve Squyres’ proposals only to have them finally accept when piggybacking onto another mission), to two years of construction and logistical problem solving, to their extended period of life on Mars (the planned 90 days reaching over 5000). It displays the feat of ingenuity and imagination mankind possesses. The CGI reenactments were a bit uninspiring to me at first, but the film eventually (better late than never) starts using sequences where the picture is built by the black and white images Opportunity took before seamlessly transitioning to the color Industrial Light and Magic footage. They weren’t therefore just arbitrary animated sequences. They were grounded in the data to approximate what the robot experienced. The whole is informative and easy to follow (the subjects mention how the adventure of it all was crucial to giving NASA a way to attract new generations without getting bogged down by the science). The structure is conventional yet smooth. And the bits where those involved in the project humanize the machines and compare them to their own lives and family members are touching. Someone has finally made a pandemic film that both taps into the universal fear of the moment and the unshakeable sense of futility felt by those of us who have yet to accept the lie that it’s over. Andy Mitton’s THE HARBINGER wields COVID as a literal and figurative foe. His characters are living through quarantine and doing everything they can to ensure their bodies remain free of the virus physically, but their minds are also being infiltrated by a different invisible danger. It’s so simple and yet so profound: our collective wish to not be forgotten. That’s what has Emily Davis’ Mavis so shaken. Enough that she calls her old college roommate (Gabby Beans’ Monique) for help when it seems her fate has already been sealed. Because, in many respects, it has. The instant our government decided that the economy was more important than human lives was the instant we forgot all those who had already been killed while also ignoring all those that still are. If their absence wasn’t enough to take notice, they might as well have never existed at all. That’s what the titular antagonist here strives to make happen. He enters Mavis and Monique’s minds to hijack their dreams until the nightmare outside and the nightmare inside can no longer be separated. It leads to some well-orchestrated scenes of terror and despair since even the bright spots of hope can be rendered as nothing but red herrings meant to sink his claws deeper. We want to believe there are some people we simply cannot forget, but a quick glimpse around my local grocery store to see no one wearing a mask proves the opposite. Davis is great as the catalyst—her fear palpable enough to transfer the “idea” of this monster to her old friend. And Beans carries the film with a strength of resolve built upon crucial yet organic exposition that’s able to show why she can be the one to finally take him down. Except, of course, that nobody is immune. Tell someone everything is okay and they’ll breathe a sigh of relief right up until the moment they realize it never actually was. By then it’s too late. “The dash makes all the difference.” It’s a great line that epitomizes Geeta Gandbhir and Sam Pollard’s documentary LOWNDES COUNTY AND THE ROAD TO BLACK POWER because of what that place meant both to the freedom march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 and the civil rights movement itself. Right there in the middle was “Bloody Lowndes”—a place that was 80% Black with 0 registered Black voters. It was the “dash” between cities and ground zero for the evolution of a nationwide struggle for racial equality. Using fantastic archival footage (so good that the filmmakers make a point to single out Jack Willis by name before the end credits to give thanks), a ton of new interviews with people who were there on the ground in the 60s, and informative context from historians, the story of how this county came together to fight for its own justice enthralls from the first scene. These are proud people who realized the ego of so-called outside “leaders” wasn’t going to be enough. As Ella Baker said, “Strong people don't need strong leaders.” There’s a propulsive energy to the whole with plenty of smiles and laughs in the recounting of stories about Stokely Carmichael (his SNCC helped organize and bolster the fight already being waged in Lowndes) or the realization that tilting the scales meant running for office as well as voting for it. Between the origin of the Black Panther logo (in response to the National Democrats of Alabama having a white rooster with the words “White Supremacy for the Right”) and the first-hand accounts of just what Lowndes was up against, the film enriches that which we know in generic terms with the specificity only lived-in experience can provide. “That dry humor keeps us invested while also lulling us to sleep before genial smiles inevitably turn into cold-blooded smirks. And it culminates with a finale as satisfyingly cathartic as it is diabolically open-ended, thanks to Günther’s unyielding naivete.” It will never cease to amaze me that Emmett Till was lynched in 1955. Between the black and white photos (intentionally meant to distort time) and the way in which the Civil Rights movement is taught (or not taught thanks to the white supremacist machinations of the Republican Party banning talk of injustice under the intentionally vague and politicized umbrella of Critical Race Theory), it’s easy to get confused and ultimately fool yourself into believing the world might ever be a better place. Bringing Chinonye Chukwu’s TILL to theaters in 2022 is therefore important. Not only must we be reminded of what happened—as well as Mamie Till-Mobley’s subsequent bravery in ensuring the world saw what Money, Mississippi did to her son—but we must also be aware that her fight to help pass a law to declare lynching a hate crime didn’t end until March. March 2022. Sixty-seven years later. Nineteen years after her own death in 2003. By presenting Emmett’s story (joyfully portrayed by Jalyn Hall) through his mother’s eyes (I don’t see any scenario where Danielle Deadwyler doesn’t get an Oscar nomination as her performance as Mamie is breathtaking), we can better understand the duality of life that continues today for America’s Black population. It’s one thing to portray a teenager who doesn’t know better making a mistake. It’s another to portray his parent’s fear in knowing how that mistake could unfathomably cost his life. The whole might be conventional on its surface insofar as how it presents the facts of what occurred before, during, and after its farce of a trial, but there’s nothing generic about the emotional weight at its back. From Deadwyler to John Douglas Thompson to Keisha Tillis to the children—there’s power in their reactions and reason why so much of the film depicts them as opposed to what sparks their reactions. Chukwu is intentionally centering the Black experience with every frame. We need only see the pain inflicted and the strength to endure it. Just like Mamie with her son’s body, TILL ensures we cannot look away. Here’s a fun one from THE 6TH DAY. Love that final zoom. (Substack apparently can’t handle an embedded gif, so you’ll have to click over for a smoother experience. Or see everything at cinematicfbombs.com.) “The plane is in danger. It can't land until a plan to alleviate that danger is made on the ground. Everything that occurs reinforces those two truths. Even so, it's never boring.” - Full review at The Film Stage."
"Nov 30, 2022",neutral,"Black Adam also features the same issue as Captain Marvel, introducing an impossibly invincible superhero with no emotion and is hard to connect to."
"Nov 30, 2022",negative,"For all the big fights, glowing CGI and mean mugging the Rock can do, this film is startlingly lifeless for having been in the works for so long."
"Nov 23, 2022",negative," The DC Extended Universe resumed with Black Adam (now on VOD streaming services like Amazon Prime Video) more than a year after James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad wound up being the rare delightful DC excursion, and several months after Matthew Reeves’ stunningly awesome The Batman officially didn’t count because alternate universes exist, you know. Two tough acts to follow, either way. Adam is a spinoff of 2019’s Shazam! and precedes the DCEU stuff under Gunn, who recently became president of such things, so here’s hoping he brings some fresh energy to upcoming Flash, Aquaman, Shazam and Blue Beetle outings (all due next year, assuming they don’t get delayed again). Especially since Black Adam feels so much like the old, wearisome, stultifyingly CGIed DC movies we’ve endured.  The Gist: Once upon a time, shit sucked. Well, shit was good before it sucked: KAHNDAQ, 2600 BCE was the original great and mighty empire, before Rome and all those other empires. The Middle Eastern city prospered until an evil king forged an evil crown with the help of six demons of the ancient world and a very rare mineral called eternium. You keeping up? This bullshit is ESSENTIAL. He enslaved his people and… it goes on, and there’s plenty of voiceover narration. Let’s just say a slave named Teth-Adam was gifted with godlike powers in order to save everyone from the evil jerks, but he was enslaved in a tomb in a structure that still stands in present-day Kahndaq, which is a police state ruled by the Intergang and a place where a hoodied kid on a skateboard radical-dudes his way through town to the tune of an old Smashing Pumpkins hit. For the citizens of Kahndaq, the world is a vampire. The kid is Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) and his mom is Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) and her brother is Karim (Mohammed Amer), and they’re members of a resistance against the Intergang. Adrianna’s idea is to find the old evil crown and do what with it now? Run around hither and thither with it like it’s a MacGuffin, that’s what. Anyway, Intergang baddies interrupt her foray into the ancient tomb and she utters an incantation punctuated with the word “Shazam!” and kapow, with a mighty burst of CGI and a weird remix of ‘Paint it Black,’ Teth-Adam (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) emerges from the nether to murder the living piss out of the bad guys. He uses his never-fully-defined powers to turn them to ash or skeletonize them or simply throw them over a mountain range with nary a thought or a signature The Rock raised eyebrow. So what does the Shazam! thing have to do with the Shazam! movie from four years ago? Something, but also nothing, because this movie doesn’t get into it. So, you might ask, Black Adam stands on its own then? Oh, you silly strawpeople, I set you up to knock you down: Of course it doesn’t! Other DC characters MUST get involved in this nonsense, since nobody’s sure if Teth-Adam is a good guy or a bad guy or what. And those characters are the Justice… Society of America. (Sad trombone? Maybe!) They are: Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), the leader, a badass with big wings and a goofy helmet; Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan!), a gent with a gold helmet that allows him to do things like see the future and replicate himself; Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), who can grow into a giant; and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), controller of mighty winds. And bursting forth from this plot is a surely deep, intricate and layered metaphor about the U.S.’ political meddling in Middle Eastern affairs. There is a butting of heads as Adrianna insists Teth-Adam is the new hero of Kahndaq, while the JSA folk insist he’s a threat to all of everything. “No more extrajudicial killings!” is something Hawkman likes to bellow. Meanwhile, Amon buddies up with the scowling and humorless Teth-Adam, giving him a catchphrase and stuff like that; maybe the guy’s warming up a little? I think he also has amnesia? I’m sure your brain would be a little cloudy if you’d been entombed for 5,000 years. Anyway, destiny intervenes when the real threat to all of everything shows up, a devilhorned demonic freak named Sabbac who can spurt the flames of heck from the occult sigil carved into his chest. Will Sabbac rule the wasteland or will somebody stop him? NO SHAZSPOILERS! What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Black Adam is a teensy fraction better than the bilgiest of DCEU dreck. Asserting that it’s more visually appealing than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Man of Steel is to say that raccoons are cuter filthy disease-ridden vermin than sewer rats. Performance Worth Watching: Rough sledding all around here. Johnson gets no opportunities to deploy his genial persona; the movie tosses a wet blanket on him. So let’s give this one to Hodge, who manages to give Hawkman some gravitas from behind that ridiculous helm. Our Take: The Who Cares of it all is significant: The Rock’s charisma hemmed in, a parade of bland DC B-leaguers, fizzling comedy, heaping cartloads of questionable CGI and action sequences designed not to thrill but to mercilessly barrage the senses. The boy ends up kidnapped, because what other purpose does such a character in such a movie serve; the villain delivers a bloviating speech when he could be delivering the kill shot; the hero who can move faster than a quark farts chooses not to during the very moment where it would most come in handy; the bad guy has an army of minions that flop over as soon as Central Command goes out, etc. And I say all this assuming that quark farts are very, very fast. The best scene in Black Adam is one that’s incredibly sobering, with somber conversation and minor-key music, punctuated with one dead-serious utterance of a single word: “Shazam!” This is the film in microcosm: Something that insists on being taken seriously, but is impossible to take seriously. Somewhere in among the fringes of this overplotted, overpopulated mess is a moral wrestling match in which self-proclaimed heroes who just want to stop a guy from killing – extrajudicially, don’t forget, that’s a key qualifier – are also preventing the oppression of an entire people. It’s a mind-your-own-beeswax plot thread that might carry some real-world implications if anyone involved gave more of a shit about actually writing things instead of jamming in extraneous underdeveloped characters and forcing a square Rock into a round hole. Jaume Collet-Serra (Jungle Cruise, four generic Liam Neeson thrillers) never figures out what to do with his morally ambiguous central character, so he surrounds Black Adam with flurries of junk and hopes we don’t notice. We did, sorry. Our Call: SKIP IT. Black Adam is one of those movies where you’re convinced the streaming progress bar is defying the laws of physics by making time move slower."
"Nov 23, 2022",negative," There arguably isn’t a single more risk-averse star in Hollywood than Dwayne Johnson, who almost exclusively dabbles in the realm of $100+ million blockbusters where he only plays extensions of himself. Black Adam may tick a couple of the boxes we’ve come to expect from The Rock’s filmography, but the latest chapter in the DCEU’s greatest strength is that its leading man fully embraces the rare opportunity to deliberately play against type. Having spent 15 years trying to get the movie made, there’s no doubting Johnson’s commitment to the cause. However, all that talk in the buildup of “changing the hierarchy of power” began to wear a little thin. Black Adam isn’t the game-changer we’d been conditioned to expect, but nor is it an outright failure, either. It exists somewhere in the middle as a relatively safe and formulaic superhero story that runs through an extensive list of the genre’s cliches, but is elevated significantly by a thumping soundtrack, some interesting world-building, and a star seamlessly slipping into the skintight costume they were born to wear. Things don’t get off to a particularly encouraging start, though, with an exposition-heavy prologue set in ancient Kahndaq establishing some heavy-handed backstory and motivations for the titular antihero, replete with the introduction of the Eternium MacGuffin – a magical element with properties that are every bit as mystical as they are destructive. Kicking off a $200 million comic book adaptation with a lengthy flashback that spends a very long time setting the stage is always a risky gambit, and some may lose interest in amongst all this talk of Eternium, champions, the Council of Wizards, the Crown of Sabbac, and the rest of the table-setting required to introduce a brand new marquee hero to the masses, but the pace thankfully picks up when the action shifts to the present day. Once Sarah Shahi’s Adrianna and her cohorts (complete with an accomplice that’s so blatantly a bad guy wasting second act screentime on the reveal is a waste of everyone’s time) visit an ancient tomb and awaken the legendary Teth-Adam, we’re off to the races in spectacularly violent fashion. You can understand why Black Adam was initially given an R-rating by the MPAA, because for once a superhero spectacular lives up to the hype that it pushed PG-13 to the very limit. In his very first action sequence, Johnson delivers on his promise that Adam isn’t here to f*ck around, as he decimates an entire unit of nefarious Intergang members by way of frying them from the inside out, ripping their limbs off, stuffing live grenades in their mouths, and throwing them as hard as he can through whatever surface is closest to hand. It’s one hell of an introduction, and sets things up nicely for a gnarlier and more envelope-pushing story of costumed crimefighting than we’ve become used to. Naturally, a 5000 year-old demigod awakening from slumber catches the attention of Amanda Waller (a performance that’s literally and figuratively phoned in by Viola Davis), who tasks the Justice Society with stopping the all-powerful entity in his tracks. Again, it’s understandable that the pacing would be slowed to a crawl as the JSA need to have their backstories filled in for audiences to care about them, but the stop-start nature of Black Adam as a whole takes a little getting used to. Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman is the stoic, dignified leader, with the actor bringing a steely gravitas to the role that isn’t there on the page given that the vast majority of his dialogue is ripped from “Superhero Screenplay 101”. Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher and Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone don’t fare as well, although you get the distinct impression they may have had plenty of scenes left on the cutting room floor. That leaves us with Pierce Brosnan’s Doctor Fate, who is an utter delight. Every bit as charming and suave as ever, the veteran brings a scene-stealing mix of fatalism and dignity to an archetypal “wizened sage” turn, generating sparks with virtually everyone he encounters. The majority of the Kahndaq natives feel underdeveloped beyond their one-note generalizations, unfortunately, but there’s some interesting subtext involving Adrianna, her son (Bodhi Sabongui’s Amon), and the nation itself that occasionally bubbles to the surface – if not often enough. She calls out the Justice Society for showing up in a country that’s been under forced occupation for three decades for the very first time solely because another metahuman has popped up on the radar. She’s 100 percent right, and the JSA are even willing to admit it, but any hint of a deeper exploration on what would be a fascinating narrative thread for an all-ages DCEU epic is swiftly jettisoned in favor of more punching and things going boom. Director Jaume-Collet Serra throws plenty of neat visual tricks into the myriad of fast-paced and frantic showdowns, but Black Adam can never escape the fact that it’s not exactly the genre’s most original effort. A villain who’s the evil mirror version of the hero? Check. Daddy issues? Check, but not entirely how you might think. A protagonist slowly learning to evolve through the life lessons imparted on them by the rest of the key players? You betcha. In true DCEU fashion, there’s even a giant sky-beam and a poorly-rendered CGI villain during the climactic showdown for good measure. There are plenty of shortcomings to be found in Black Adam, then, but Johnson is never one of them, with his underrated acting chops compensating for the deliberate reigning in of his boundless charisma. Teth finds killing as easy as breathing, and he doesn’t quite get why the JSA are so bemused by him making the world a safer place by turning dangerous people into dust. It may not be “the Dirty Harry of superhero movies” as we were told, but the amorality that powers the main attraction is an intriguing wrinkle in a medium where almost every major name is colored distinctly in black or white. Black Adam doesn’t reinvent the wheel, nor does it even tear a single page out of the superhero playbook. Instead of being completely dismantled, the hierarchy of power has been slightly shifted, but that’s not exactly a bad thing. The DCEU needs an evolution as opposed to a revolution, and The Rock has introduced what might turn out to be the ideal candidate with which to lead the charge."
"Nov 23, 2022",neutral," I generally like superhero movies. I appreciate the escapism, the nonsense. I don’t even mind familiar. Black Adam (2022) not only feels familiar, but it also borders on derivative and that doesn’t bode well for DC. In the northern African country of Kahndaq, treasurer hunter Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) searches for the ancient Crown of Sabbac, rumored to give the bearer great power. While fleeing for her life, she utters the incantation that resurrects Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson) from his 5,000-year slumber. Adrianna’s son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) believes Black Adam is there to be a savior of Kahndag from the last 27 years of oppression by ruthless mercenaries calling themselves Intergang. Amon spends a lot of time on his skateboard teaching Black Adam catchphrases. Meanwhile Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) has recruited Carter Hall, aka Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), and the Justice Society of America to subdue and contain Black Adam to prevent him from doing immeasurable damage to the world. Hall taps Kent Nelson, Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan) and rookie heroes, Maxine Hunkel, Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) and Al Rothstein, The Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), to help bring Black Adam under control, with decidedly mixed results. So, everyone is fighting for the magic crown, the JSA is fighting the people of Kahndag for the right to kidnap their chosen savior, and Hawkman and Black Adam have frequent staredowns. Meanwhile, Kahndag watches helplessly as more of its cultural artifacts destroyed by people who are claiming to help. I’m sure this is a statement about how developed countries do more damage than good under the guise of liberation, but there’s way too much going on in this movie to pretend it also has a political statement. And there is a lot going on. Just when you think the story is over, there’s easily another 40 minutes to go, so this two-hour movie feels like two-and-a-half hours. It’s around the end of the second act when the big climactic scene should be getting underway, when another plot point or two get inserted and suddenly we have zombies. Setting aside the jumble of story issues, we have a cast that feels tapped solely for name recognition and then slid into colorful costumes. We forgive a lot of Dwayne Johnson’s comedies, because frankly, the man is so charming and personable. This is a large man with a large personality and his charisma carries a lot of unfortunate movies into watchable comedies. Because Black Adam is such an angry anti-hero, Johnson’s personality is dialed all the way down to zero. Black Adam could have been a completely animated Vocaloid and we wouldn’t have known the difference. It’s as if Johnson watched the first Terminator (1984) and decided he was going to channel Arnold Schwarzenegger exclusively. I would watch Pierce Brosnan smooth his suit and straighten his tie for two hours, and to the studio’s credit, he actually gets a little superhero action in, but dispensing fatherly advice is not why I watch him on screen. Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell feel like Gen Z afterthoughts and are wasted as Atom Smasher and Cyclone since neither are terribly effective – he gets really big while wearing his uncle’s suit and she’s really smart and makes strong winds. Yet, none of those abilities are helpful against rampaging demi-gods. It’s a poor reflection of Hawkman’s skills as a strategist, but it’s only one of a few things that aren’t logical about Black Adam. It’s a DC movie with solid DC canon backing it up, but Marvel has so completely dominated the superhero genre, everything about Black Adam feels like Marvel fanfiction. We see Hawkman and think Falcon and a knock-off Iron Man. We see Atom Smasher, and think Ant-Man with a generous helping of Spider-Man’s awkwardness. We see Doctor Fate and think Doctor Strange with a sprinkling of Professor X. We see Cyclone and think Rogue and neat cosplay. Kahndaq feels like Wakanda, with veins of the mythical element Eternium running through its hills instead of Vibranium. It feels too familiar to really enjoy it. Bear with me because I’m not a comic book reader so I don’t obsessively know the canon, but we have had 24 years of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, and even a few DC films that didn’t completely tank in that span. We’re all familiar with the Justice League and I can even do a quick search on its precursor, the Justice Society of America, consisting of Hawkman, Atom, Doctor Fate, and a few others. And just as easily in that same search, I see Waller never worked with the Justice Society of America. This is a DC Comics multi-deck player set to Random. For all of the clever dialogue and twists, Black Adam is very self-aware. It’s a cinematic universe that doesn’t want to be compared to its competition, yet spends a lot of time copying that competition. With the exception of Shazam (2019) and Birds of Prey (2020), DC is striking out with both the one-offs and the ensemble pieces. Thank goodness it’s not up to me to salvage it, but if this is the best they’ve got, maybe hold out for Shazam! Fury of the Gods in 2023. It’s okay for a sequel to be derivative of itself. Black Adam (2022) is rated PG-13 for mild swears, people getting gut-stabbed, people getting shot, people thrown from great heights, fatal concussive injuries, internal immolation, and explosions. Well, darn. I had hoped this would be somehow better – but your review confirmed what I feared. Dwayne Johnson should never be “dialed down” – as you noted, his charisma and “larger than life” persona need to channeled into a legit and likable character. And all of these superhero movies – I guess these are the 21st century version of the Western films/TV shows of the 50s and 60s, and at some point, they just become one big “superhero!” thing with few distinguishing features."
"Nov 19, 2022",negative," There was a time when superhero films were the exception. They were new, exciting, and at their very best, were playing with genre conventions and doing something unexpected. Now, we get several superhero films a year, not to mention countless TV shows on various streaming platforms. They’ve become the rule, not the exception, which almost automatically makes them less exciting. At the end of the day, most of them follow the same old formula of a hero’s journey; they struggle with their powers and encounter a powerful enemy that nearly defeats them until ultimately tapping into something more profound to save the day. Ta-dah! Jaume Collet-Serra’s Black Adam, on the surface, tries to offer something different. It’s been a passion project for its star, Dwayne Johnson, who promised that the anti-hero’s arrival would ‘change the hierarchy of DC’. Unfortunately, Black Adam succumbs to the genre’s worst tropes and isn’t aided by the baffling, near-incompetent editing.  The story takes place in the fictional land of Kahndaq. After a brief prologue that explains how Teth Adam (he’s not called Black Adam yet, but patience, dear reader) was born, the action moves to modern days. Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) is looking for a mystical crown that once divided the people and is incredibly dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands.  Adrianna manages to awaken Teth Adam from his slumber, but boy, is he pissed. Teth Adam has no problem killing anyone and everyone in his way, which sends the Justice Society – Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone – to Kahndaq, where they clash with Teth Adam. Obviously.  First things first, there is a lot to like in Black Adam. Dwayne Johnson is impossibly likeable and has a magnetic screen presence. Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate and Aldis Hodge as Hawkman are also compelling, especially Brosnan, who brings a sense of esteemed and renowned dignity into the film.  But Black Adam feels incomplete; it’s rushed, narratively messy and badly edited. Director Jaume Collet-Serra struggles to find the right balance of tone and story beats to focus on and Black Adam often feels like one continuous action sequence and that’s not a compliment. The action, too reliant on CGI, tries to imply violence without fully committing to it.  Black Adam has been posed as a more violent, darker entry into the post-Zack Snyder DCEU, but if anything, this feels like a return to Snyder’s style of filmmaking. There’s his signature religious imagery, a lot of the action is played in slow-motion, and the greyish colour palette, meant to evoke angst and seriousness, comes across as dull. Visually, Black Adam might be one of the ugliest films of 2022.  What makes it even more frustrating is the infinite amount of potential the film has. Black Adam’s best scene is when Adrianna tells the Justice Society off for storming into her homeland and kicking up a fuss now that Teth Adam is causing havoc, but they haven’t done anything in the past 27 years that the country has been in conflict.  It would have been a meaty angle to write your film from, but it’s quickly abandoned. Collet-Serra, an outstanding director when working with the right material, struggles to let his style bleed through, but there are some strong individual moments here. More than anything, Black Adam seems to just set up the future of the DCEU, but I must say, it doesn’t look very good.  ★★★★☆ The Sitting Duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist Maureen Kearney, brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Huppert, amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship.

"Nov 16, 2022",negative," In Black Adam, the eponymous hero is awakened after 5000 years by a professor in need of rescuing from ruthless mercenaries deep in an ancient temple of Kahndaq – a fictional Middle Eastern country. ""Why have the producers gone to great lengths to cast actors with MENA heritage to play the Kahndaqi supporting characters, but not the lead? Why do these Kahndaqi characters have Middle Eastern accents but Black Adam does not?"" It’s a brutal, blackly humorous action sequence that pushes the bloody boundaries of previous 12A superhero movies. And yet, the first words this all-powerful Kahndaqi utters then (and throughout the film) are delivered in an American accent. Now, I’ve been pretty consistent with my frustration about Dwayne Johnson taking this role. Sure, I could understand why he was cast 15 years ago after playing the Mesopotamian villain-turned-hero Scorpion King in The Mummy franchise. He was big, brown and it was a time before Hollywood really started to listen to the demand for better, more accurate ethnic representation. So why in 2022 have we accepted the casting of a non-Middle Eastern actor as the first Middle Eastern superhero to get a solo movie? Star power? Why have the producers gone to great lengths to cast actors with MENA heritage to play the Kahndaqi supporting characters, but not the lead? Why do these Kahndaqi characters have Middle Eastern accents but Black Adam does not? When a relatively unknown Chadwick Boseman was cast as Black Panther he fought to ensure he and his castmates playing Wakandans could speak with sub-Saharan African accents. ""They felt like it was maybe too much for an audience to take,"" the late actor said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. ""They felt like, 'Would people be able to understand it through a whole movie?' and 'If we do it now, we're stuck with it.' I felt the exact opposite – like, if I speak with a British accent, what's gonna happen when I go home?"" Given that Boseman shared a similar African heritage to the Marvel hero, hearing him speak was certainly not jarring. Was Johnson concerned that it would be awkward for him to use a Middle Eastern accent because he is not? I wish I had the answers but so far in this press tour, I’ve not read one interview where a journalist has posed these valid questions to the actor. The American accent isn’t just jarring because of the casting. The thematic throughline of director Jaume Collet-Serra’s film about neo-imperialist oppression in the Middle East and the overreach of Western superpowers is inconsistent and certainly doesn’t hit as hard when the super-saviour sounds like the so-called foreign invaders he’s fighting against. This, however, is the tip of the iceberg for the ineffectiveness of a film that once promised to change the game for superhero stories. In typical origin story fashion, we begin in 2600 BCE and are told the story of how Teth-Adam gets his powers (It’s changed to “Black” later). The tyrannical king of Kahndaq has enslaved the people and forced them to mine for a special mineral called Eternium. He needs it to fashion a demonic crown that would allow him to wield dark powers and rain hell on Earth. When a slave boy rebels and faces execution, the wizard Shazam (who also gave the DC hero Shazam his powers) picks him as Earth’s magical champion and the fight begins. This ancient world takes its cues from Zack Synder’s predilection for highly-stylised Orientalism but as we fast forward to present-day Kahndaq, it is drenched in the yellow filter Hollywood loves to other Middle Eastern places with. Kahndaq is being occupied by a mercenary crime syndicate called Intergang and they are brutally oppressing the Kahndaqi people while robbing the land of its natural resources to fuel its arsenal. Resistance comes in the form of Professor Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi), her electrician brother Karim (Mohammed Amer) and her superhero-obsessed son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui). They bring heart to these side characters but they are mostly just there to humanise Teth-Adam. A sort of T2: Judgement Day relationship develops between Amon and Teth-Adam which has its funny moments as the kid teaches the ancient dude about modern life and catchphrases but Johnson is too robotic. Honestly, this was surprising to see from the normally hilarious and magnetic actor. Here Johnson's line delivery is flat, his brooding lacks charisma and his comedic beats are hit-and-miss. Comedian Mo Amer manages to earn a few chuckles with his quips and sight gags but the script penned by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani, is bland. It’s simultaneously too exposition-heavy and yet doesn’t tell us enough thanks to a glut of new DC characters it has to introduce. A central conflict occurs between Teth-Adam and the seemingly-long established Justice Society, not to be confused with the Justice League – where have they been all this time? Led by a no-nonsense Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) it features heroes Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) and Atom Smasher (Noah Centino), who are cute but feel inessential to the plot apart from a couple of action scenes. Interestingly, the writers chose to go with a younger version of Atom Smasher but not the younger version of Fate, Khalid Nassour, an Egyptian-American medical student who inherits the title from Kent Nelson, here played by the always charming Pierce Brosnan. Between this casting choice, and the complete lack of backstory for either this magical hero or Hawkman, the MENA elements are stripped away in favour of an over-Americanised narrative. It both wants to admonish these patronising heroes whilst also relying on them to save the day yet never having them do any significant self-interrogation. The Justice Society preach “no killing,” but they are under the jurisdiction of Task Force X’s Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) who famously pushes the kill-to-win strategy. Adrianna defends Teth-Adam by saying he’s willing to do the dark things white knights like the Justice Society can’t do but two Suicide Squad movies and a Peacemaker series have already played this song. Did we also forget that Wonder Woman killed terrorists in Justice League? That Superman killed Zod in Man of Steel? Make it make sense. Then we have Marwan Kenzari’s Ishmael whose tightly-coiled mullet, 80s look lets us know that he’s bad news. I once tweeted Johnson that I’d be unimpressed if they made Kenzari a villain. He said I would be and I can confirm that I am. He’s barely in it, only to pop up in the latter half with a rushed generic plot twist to lead us into the big final battle. Once again I am asking Hollywood to give this dreamboat a leading role worthy of his talent. For a superteam that cares about human life, there’s a surprising lack of regard for the buildings, ancient architecture and busy markets they help destroy in some rather repetitive slow-motion fight scenes against this vengeful champion. If anything this movie has made me have more respect for filmmakers like Ryan Coogler, Destin Daniel Cretton and Mohammed Diab who enriched their superhero stories with cultural specificity. Here we have Karim listening to old American hits, Amon's room covered in Batman and Superman posters and a KFC (Kahndaqi Fried Chicken) gag – would it have killed them to use a needle drop from a Middle Eastern artist? Moon Knight is full of them.  Hanna Flint is a film and TV critic, writer and author of Strong Female Character with bylines at Empire, Time Out, Elle, Town & Country, the Guardian, BBC Culture and IGN."
"Nov 14, 2022",negative," “Black Adam”, the latest in our current reality of multiple CGI superhero spectacles per year, feels built on paradoxes. Some of those paradoxes are peculiar to this specific story, and others emerge from general recurring issues with the film’s relationship to the DC empire, and superhero films at large. In this way, “Black Adam” is rarely as egregious an example of superhero malaise as much as the general response to it suggests. And yet, it’s instructive to think of all the way all the things that might work – and occasionally do work – in “Black Adam” feel compulsively neutered by the things that don’t work. Even as competing conglomerates Marvel and DC feign progressive ideologies in their casting practices, the current slate of superhero cinema still feels hegemonic, whether in its whiteness or in its blinkered Americana. “Black Adam” offers a welcome rejection of both, at first—a potentiality that the film finds itself grappling with to diminishing returns. The story begins thousands of years ago, when a tyrannical king creates the Crown of Sabbac to attain power over the rest of the kingdom. A young boy resists and is given the powers of Shazam, becoming the champion to liberate the enslaved. In present-day in the same kingdom in Kahndaq (a fictional Middle Eastern country), the population is oppressed by Intergang, a crime-syndicate and neo-colonial force stripping the formerly noble country of its glory. The country needs liberation, and Adrianna Tomaz (university archaeologist and resistor) along with three colleagues ventures in search of the lost Crown, for reasons that are somewhat vague. They do find the crown, but they also find the tomb of Teth-Adam, supposedly the liberating champion from millennia before. When the search for the Crown is foiled by mercenaries, Adrianna calls on to Teth-Adam for assistance and he awakens. But Teth-Adam is a vengeful and mercurial figure – laying waste to the country’s oppressors with glee. American agent Amanda Waller is troubled by the appearance of this seemingly unassailable figure and sends four superheroes of the Justice Society (not the Justice League) to capture him. From there things go awry. For the characters, but also for the film itself.  Even when it does, though, “Black Adam” is held together by the not unimportant reality of a superhero film that seems aware of, if not actively engaged in, an antiimperialist stance set primarily outside of the Global North. Yes, much of this is done vaguely in a way that ever so slightly avoids examining actual the complicity of contemporary superpowers in destroying Middle Eastern countries very similar to the fictional Kahndaq. But it is an effort that feels complex on its own so that one can immediately recognise and even appreciate the potential political commentary even when “Black Adam” declines to do very much with it. A sharply specific tale of Kahndaq and the dynamics of its contemporary characters trying to liberate themselves feels like a visceral possibility for a superhero film, but then for “Black Adam” to justify its superhero existence it cannot be content with being sharply specific. It must look outward, because it must justify its existence with the larger lore of the DC context. The screenplay (credited to Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani) justifies this by inserting the urgency of the Justice Society’s need to neuter Black Adam. These are consistently the worst parts of the film. Viola Davis’ return as Amanda Waller feels dispensable and each of the four members of the society – Pierce Brosnan as the wizened illusionist Doctor Fate, Aldis Hodge as the stern leader Hawkman, Noah Centineo as the obligatory young upstart in the form of Atom Smasher and Quintessa Swindell as the obligatory ingenue in the form of Cyclone – bring the film to a grinding halt with forced banter that feels unnecessary and particularly incongruous with the actual life and death dynamics in Kahndaq. The story tries to confront that by some moments where the characters explicitly reject the presence of the Americans, but it feels counterintuitive. Even when the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) characters question the presence of the American superheroes, noticeably absent when the country was being oppressed, “Black Adam” is too bound to the larger machine of capitalism that is DC so it feels unable to really engage with the competing desire to be actually revolutionary. Even “Black Panther”, a wholly better film that similarly engages with themes of anti-hegemony, is not wholly successful as an anti-imperialistic text. Coogler’s film, as good as it is, has its own messy politics that seems uncertain how to deploy queries of wealth without falling prey to empty capitalistic thirst. And “Black Adam” is no “Black Panther,” for many reasons; many of them to do with craft. Editors Mike Sale and John Lee feel burdened with the conflicting plots and the film’s own convoluted structure. And Lawrence Sher’s vision of this fictional Middle Eastern country still feels too gauzily yellow in the way that American contexts of these places tend to be. And then there’s the way that the film doesn’t seem as exuberantly in step with the possibilities of its MENA representation. And it’s the MENA dynamic where “Black Adam” finds another unscalable paradox. Dwayne Johnson, although conventionally and ambiguously Brown (he is half black and half Samoan) is not a MENA actor and although ambiguous ethnicities have been par for the course for much of contemporary cinema with brownness (whether from the Middle East, Pacific Island, Latin America) being an interchangeable currency, the casting feels unwieldy when the film so preciously contextualises Johnson’s Teth-Adam as the champion sent to deliver the specific of this specific country from the foreigners. This fact rests uncomfortably against the film’s central figure, Johnson. Johnson’s own dogged interest in this story has been key to its development but it feels like such an unforced error that the film which explicitly speaks of identity and heroic representation casts an explicitly non-MENA performer as this great figure of liberation. It does not help that the performance is also not good. Johnson opts to play Teth-Adam’s return after a 4000-year entombment as a robotic figure. He is a Prehistoric God as Terminator. And in the face of Sarah Shahi doggedly devoting so much emotion to Adrianna, the leaden approach to characterisation from Johnson feels like a vacuum of emotion. Why does Adrianna’s brother spend so much of his time listening to American oldies? Why does the film’s own understanding and valuation of its native culture feel so ambivalent? Why does Johnson’s characterisation of Teth Adam feel confined to an American version of postmodern humour rather than something that feels meaningfully engaged with the film’s MENA context? There are too many questions that “Black Adam” shrugs at. The much-vaunted cameo in the film which many know of doesn’t inspire me to confidence. No fault of the cameo performer but “Black Adam” is best when it turns in on itself. Keeping its story focused only internally. The revelation of Teth-Adam’s existence offers a moment of emotionality drawing a parallel across timelines to emphasise what parents might do for their children. But every attempt to tie it to larger plotty banalities of superhero urgencies feel clunky. And yet it’s those ties that have assured that audiences are seated. It is compulsory entertainment. You can’t miss this if you want to understand the next and the next and so on. But what happens when their ouroboros approach to its effect end up robbing it of the faint profundity it might create otherwise? As I said “Black Adam” is trapped in a paradox."
"Nov 13, 2022",positive," Dwayne Johnson is built like a superhero. So it was no great surprise when he was attached to a comic book property back in 2007. The surprise came when out of all the characters he could have played, the one he wanted was Black Adam. Fifteen years later, amidst the resurgence of the comic book movie, two questions remain. 1. Was it worth the wait? and 2. Has the hierarchy of power in the DC universe actually changed? As character introductions go, Black Adam’s is incredibly strong and dark. Released from his tomb after 5000 years, he grabs a mercenary by the neck and using his powers proceeds to burn him from the inside out. Casually crushing his scorched skull to add an exclamation point on this vicious kill. Think back to the much debated killing of Zod by Superman in Man Of Steel. There Superman killed because he had to. Black Adam kills because he can. The hierarchy of power has indeed been changed within the universe with Black Adam being presented as someone on an equal footing in terms of power and ability with Kal-El. The problem this creates is Adam’s position within it. In the DC comics lore, Black Adam is one of the main antagonists of Shazam. Indeed, the first Shazam film hinted at the character as the champion who came before Billy. However, given the long and winding road to this film’s release, it is fair to say that Johnson has his sights set a little higher as to where he sees. Even going as far as teasing it at the end of DC League Of Superpets in a scene where he voiced three characters. The film flip-flops between portraying him as a herp, a villain and an anti-hero. Framed as a threat to the planet because of his power but seen as the potential liberator of Kahndaq. As Doctor Fate tells him “you can be the destroyer of this world… or its saviour”. Part of that central crux is down to Johnson himself in the role. Obviously he has an undeniable screen presence, commanding one’s attention. Albeit his trademark charm, smile (and eyebrow) tempered by an intense brooding. One of the most popular stars on the planet, and someone who is incredibly protective of his brand, it is not hard to see he would want to soften the edges a little. Where the MCU has gone from strength to strength under one singular vision, the DCEU has flip-flopped between multiple approaches. If there is one man who can course correct and bring everything together, it is Dwayne Johnson. This film comes at a pivotal moment for the DCEU. The main titles are suffering from off-screen controversy, cancellations and delays, while the most successful properties (critically and commercially) have been the stand alones (Joker, The Batman). In many ways it feels like, not a soft reboot, but a hard recalibration. It forgoes tying directly to Shazam, instead opening up the universe by introducing the Justice Society of America via Amanda Waller. Although not to the point of explaining why Justice requires both a Society AND a League. Yet ripping up the established order of things. Literally. In a fistfight with Hawkman in a teen’s bedroom, Adam rips and punches his way through posters and memorabilia of the current members of the Justice League. It is a shame therefore that while it sets itself out as a fresh start, the film feels like one that would have been made back in 2007 when Johnson was first attached. It has its moments. Lorne Balfe’s score for example, and the supporting performances of Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan. There is nothing here that elevates it above what has come before. Like the video game style fight scenes or the JSA operating out of a mansion that has a jet hiding under the gardens that feels very X-Men circa 2000. The choice of his Jungle Cruise director Jaume Collet-Serra is, like everything else, a very safe choice.  When it comes to superhero movies however, the sequels are often better than the originals. Once the exposition and character introduction is complete, the training wheels can come off. Black Adam is not quite the superhero film we deserve but it might just be the one we need right now. Dwayne Johnson has set the stage to be the saviour of the DCEU. From his time as a wrestler, he has a great sense of being able to read an audience, know what it wants and deliver accordingly. "
"Nov 11, 2022",neutral,"Black Adam has some amazing characters in The Rock's Black Adam, along with JSA members Hawkman & Doctor Fate played by Hodge & Brosnan highlighting every seen they are in. The human element and antagonist are on the weak side sadly bringing down the film"
"Nov 9, 2022",negative," Don’t believe the promoted tweets that claim Dwayne Johnson is delivering a “nuanced” performance–Black Adam is a terrible film and Johnson’s acting fulfills his nickname of “The Rock.” It’s a dull film, even with the amount of blasts and fights and destruction present. The film also does a piss-poor job of showcasing Middle Eastern culture and imperialism in a way that’s informative, engaging, or even entertaining. Black Adam is set in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq, a country that seems like a cross between Iraq and Egypt. The film wants the audience to be immersed in the world of Kahndaq, but the film could care less about the culture it’s trying to create or emulate. Even when it comes down to the accents, every actor playing a Kahndaqian has an accent except for Johnson, who sounds like himself–an American–even though his character Teth-Adam is over 5,000 years old. The lack of focus on Khandaqian culture and worldbuilding leaves the film feeling empty, even though, if we’re going by the cuneiform-style writing shown on Khandaqian artifacts, there’s a ton of real-world culture the film could draw from since cuneiform originated in ancient Sumer, located in modern-day Iraq.  With Khandaq being reduced to one city center, it feels more like a town rather than an entire country. Even worse, that townscape looks like nearly every other representation of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in American film and television. “It dehumanizes us,” he said, according to Comic Book Movie. “We are always naked, we are always sexy, we are always bad, we are always over the top. You never see Cairo. You always see Jordan shot for Cairo, Morocco shot for Cairo, sometimes Spain shot for Cairo. This really angers us.” ” I remember seeing Wonder Woman 1984 and there was a big sequence in Egypt and it was a disgrace for us. You had a sheik – that doesn’t make any sense to us. Egypt looked like a country from the Middle Ages. It looked like the desert,” he continued. You can also see how the Kahndaqian characters are all dressed as if the 1980s, bringing to mind the era of Indiana Jones’ popularity. Characters drive old cars (including the film’s main vehicle, a van with a tape deck), or have old hairstyles, or are doing out-of-date things (like skateboarding in a way that reminds you more of 1990s “radical” culture rather than the X Games). Even more damning, look at how Cairo, Egypt is portrayed under Diab’s watch on Moon Knight. You see bright colors, contemporary clothes and cars, sophistication–everything you don’t see in Western portrayals of the area. (More pictures found at MCU Location Scout.) To add even more insult to injury, let’s look at how modern-day Iraq looks. Note that it’s completely different from how Kahndaq is portrayed in Black Adam.  When the film does try to inject some commentary or authenticity, it’s done in a laughable way. Female lead character Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) rightly tells the Justice Society that they haven’t shown up at all to help Kahndaq, who has been terrorized by outside entities, until the country’s champion shows up. This is the strongest element of the film. But because of the film’s lack of interest in worldbuilding, we don’t know why outside forces want the region’s resources so much, what impact they have on the wider world, and why other forces within Kahndaq haven’t revolted before Teth-Adam’s arrival. Throughout most of the film, the portrayal of Kahndaqians has been as victims, waiting on one man to show up. The amount of destruction done to the country also undercuts any message the Justice Society might have. Even though they claim they are trying to save the area from Teth-Adam, they literally destroy priceless artifacts, not to mention almost every building in the city center. Teth-Adam isn’t any better, since he (and Hawkman, played by Aldis Hodge) destroy Isis’ home for no reason other than for audience laughs or for fighting set pieces. In other words, Kahndaq doesn’t matter as it’s own entity–it only matters because of its relation to Teth-Adam. Most of the worldbuilding that happens in the film comes from flashbacks and archaeological objects. But again, the sparse worldbuilding doesn’t immerse. Ancient Kahndaq is still portrayed with that same dusty filter, the same feeling of victimization. Sadly, there were glimmers of hope for what the movie could have been. No character in the flashback scenes wear colorful clothing–everything is, for some reason, beige or cream even though people in ancient times wore tons of color, as shown in this illustration of ancient Sumer. The architecture, such as the ziggurat-like structure where the king resided in the film, also reads “ancient Sumerian,” but again, the architecture would have had some type of color, if not the outside, then at least on the inside. Sources state that the very top of ziggurats, the temple, would have been painted indigo blue. And, like all ancient cultures, ancient Sumerian sculpture included color inlays. As Art in Context writes, Sumerian pieces had “decorative elements made from semi-precious stones like alabaster, lapis lazuli, and serpentine” and also used metals including “silver, gold, bronze and copper as inlays and designs on various objects.” But one hallway isn’t enough. If the filmmaking team were truly interested, we could have gotten more of a sense of Kahndaq culture since ancient Sumer was a highly advanced civilization. Cuneiform, for instance, is the oldest recorded language in the world, appearing around 3100 B.C., according to archeological records (as reported by History.com). The Epic of Gilgamesh, still taught in schools today, is the oldest epic poem on Earth, even older than the Bible. The civilization also made great strides in science, engineering, math, architecture and more, including developing the modern system for keeping time–60 seconds to a minute, 60 minutes to an hour, etc. Sumerian music has also influenced the world, with “Hurrian Hymn No. 6” as the oldest musically notated song in the world. Black Adam could have used this film as a moment to truly embrace MENA heritage, similar to how Black Panther uses a fictional African nation to highlight and honor real-world African cultures. But instead, worldbuilding and character building came second to showcasing Johnson’s star power in the most vain light possible. As a character, Black Adam is only as engaging as the world surrounding him–seeing the strongest man in the world destroy stuff and act stoically is boring if there’s nothing there to provide context to that character. For as expensive as it was to create this film, it certainly could have done much more to not feel so cheap, in more ways than one."
"Nov 9, 2022",negative," lack Adam’s venture onto the big screen had been in the works in various iterations since the mid ‘00s. That might explain why the new Black Adam film feels like it belongs in the mid ‘00s, although this explanation shouldn’t have to apply – you’d think that at some point someone would have realized how far superhero movies have come in the last two decades and then given this stodgy picture a sharp, swift revamp. But clearly, they didn’t, so here we are.  The newest addition to DC’s generally unexceptional Extended Universe is an unexciting affair that needlessly gives its protagonist an uninspired, drawn-out origin story in this mostly unnecessary solo vehicle. Dwayne Johnson stars as the titular anti-villain, a former slave bestowed with the powers of various Egyptian gods, who is awakened from his tomb after 5000 years and immediately gets down to business, decimating baddies left, right, and centre. An irked Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, reprising the role) sees him as a threat and tasks the Justice Society – rule-abiding Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), soothsaying Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), wind-controlling Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and size-changing Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) – to take him into custody. Resistance fighter Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) – the woman responsible for Adam’s resurrection – has, in the meantime, managed to find the Crown of Sabbac, a relic that can potentially give its bearer immense power but that could cause massive destruction if it falls into the wrong hands. That pair of hands belongs to Ishmael (Marwan Kenzari), who desperately wants to obtain the crown and unleash its powers. When things get dire, Black Adam and the Justice Society must navigate their clashing views of justice as they try to save the world from annihilation.  There is a world of potential in exploring vigilantism, vengeance, and the whole “one man’s terrorist…” concept, and Black Adam has the perfect protagonist and setup to do just that. But the film is too afraid to embrace the inherent darkness of its central character and the world around him. Instead, the movie just sticks to a beige, unexciting, predictable story, delivered through weak acting performances further decimating the tale’s impact.  As a spin-off of sorts to 2019’s delightful Shazam!, this middling new entry feels like a step back for the DCEU and might ultimately leave you wishing that someone would take this film back to the aughts and leave it there."
"Nov 9, 2022",positive,"What Black Adam lacks in originality, it makes up for in entertainment value."
"Nov 8, 2022",neutral," Lightning seldom strikes the same place twice, unless you’re a DC character uttering the word “Shazam!” but I digress, in this case, I’m referring to the always charismatic Dwayne Johnson collaborating with director Jaume Collet-Serra. The two hit it off with the enjoyable “Jungle Cruise” but their reunion leaves a lot to be desired. “Black Adam” suffers from sloppy CGI effects, overused tropes, and a lack of empathy for any of its characters. I enjoyed the dark overtones but they’re too little too late. The Rock didn’t cook up this hot mess but he sure is served up as the main dish. “Waiter, check please.” Set in 2600 B.C.E. the film opens in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq where its people have become enslaved by tyrannical King Ahk-Ton (Marwan Kenzari) who forces them to dig for a magical mineral named Eternium. With it, he can summon the Crown of Sabbac which will give the wearer superpowers bestowed by the six demons of Hell. This isn’t a Guillermo del Toro anti-hero film, so the dark subject matter is unfortunately saved for the final reel. The origins story written by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani shows how a heroic young boy named Hurut (Jalon Christian) became the people’s champion after the Council of Wizards bestow upon him the powers of Shazam (nice cameo by Djimon Hounsou reprising his role). Hurut is a straight-up superhero who makes the ultimate sacrifice by transferring his powers to his dying father Teth-Adam (Johnson) who becomes Black Adam in a change from the DC comics story, where it was his uncle. Hurut becomes a young boy again after transferring his powers and he’s quickly killed by the king’s guards. Black Adam, filled with rage, kills Ahk-Ton and his men, and in the process almost wipes Kahndaq off the map. The wizards deem Black Adam not worthy of the superpowers and entomb him where he lays dormant for 5000 years. Fast forward to the present where rebel mom Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) goes searching for the Crown of Sabbac with her comic book-reading and skateboarding son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) whose bedroom is littered with posters of every DC superhero. On a side note, Shahi, who was born in Euless, Texas, went on to win the Miss Fort Worth USA pageant in 1997 and then became a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader before moving to Los Angeles where she was encouraged to take up acting by director Robert Altman. Adrianna and Amon are joined by her brother Karim (Houston comedian Mohammed ‘Mo’ Amer) and Ishmael (Marwan Keznari) who looks vaguely familiar. While searching for the crown they accidentally free Black Adam from his prison who is justifiably groggy, with no coffee, and 5000 years of pent-up frustration, what do you expect? He immediately starts wiping out Kahndaq’s modern oppressors, the foreign group Intergang, while reminding everyone that he’s not a hero. Black Adam is a supervillain in DC’s comics, here he’s a watered-down antihero which only confuses the audience who aren’t sure who to root for when the Justice Society shows up to kill Black Adam after he just freed the people of Kahndaq. Speaking of the Justice Society (JSA), this B-team of superheroes isn’t as well-known as DC’s Justice League (JLA) which features Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. Still, they are a force to be reckoned with in their own right, thanks to Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan) and Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), the Society’s strongest members. Novice superheroes Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) remain on standby until Fate gives them the green light, which happens a lot since all of them are needed to fight Black Adam. The setting combined with Dwayne Johnson gives the film a “Stargate” meets “The Scorpion King” feel as it relies on one overplayed trope after another to drive the story. The mind-numbing special effects are just a greatest-hits package of blows, crashes, and explosions highlighted by inconsistent CGI which looks great one moment and shoddy the next. “Jungle Cruise” was surprisingly an entertaining film even though it was based on a Disney theme park ride. Its success was primarily due to Johnson’s charisma and Emily Blunt’s charm. With “Black Adam” the beloved former wrestler is required to tone down the charm and humor, his calling card, so with just his physique to rely on, Johnson has no choice but to go directly from one fighting scene to the next. Occasionally he gets in a funny one-liner while brooding. The final chapter gets dark as demon villain Sabbac (Marwan Kenzari) shows up with an army of skeleton warriors who are about as menacing as Benny the cabbie in “Halloweentown”, minus the humor and dad jokes to keep in line with the brooding theme. Dwayne Johnson can salvage almost any film, but “Black Adam” proves to be a far greater adversary than his star power can conquer. Make sure you stay for the post-credits sequence as a familiar face shows up that brings hope that Johnson will get another chance to tackle the role in a much better film with a much better rival.

"Nov 5, 2022",negative," Years ago, when I taught screenwriting, I told students: “Show me a story,” adding that good stories need solid characters. Both are lacking in Jaume Collet-Serra’s cacophonous live-action DC cartoon. The prologue introduces the ancient Middle Eastern kingdom of Kahndaq, where the ruler Sabaac forces his slaves to mine for the magical metal Eternium. When a huge gemstone is found, a young boy encourages others to revolt but – after he’s captured and about to be executed – powerful wizards intervene, transforming him into the titular champion (Dwayne Johnson) who topples the entire realm. 5000 years later in Kahndaq, as archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) searches for the king’s legendary Eternium crown, she unwittingly unearths the mythological spandex-clad anti-hero, Teth Adam – with a pentagram scar on his chest and a backstory with his son Hurut. That’s where Rory Haines, Sohrab Noshirvani and Adam Sztykiel’s ‘origin’ script stops being coherent. While Adrianna’s skate-boarding, comics-obsessed son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) introduces disoriented yet rage-filled Adam to the modern world, smugly preening Adam advocates violence/destruction as the only way to solve whatever problems occur. Meanwhile, feeding into the concept of Western imperialism, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles four members of America’s Justice League – Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) – to intervene. “In this world, there are heroes and there are villains. Heroes don’t kill people,” golden-winged Hawkman tells Adam. “Well, I do,” Adam retorts, adding “Force is always necessary.” FYI: When Black Adam says “Shazam!” it’s not the familiar “Shazam!” uttered by Captain Marvel, although it also serves as an acronym to activate their superpowers – but that’s never explained.  And – if you’ve remained stoic through the perfunctory two hours+ – stay for the ‘revealing’ credits, featuring a cameo by a much beloved DC hero, setting up a future franchise confrontation."
"Nov 4, 2022",negative," If you appreciate Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s smolder, director Jaume Collet-Serra with cinematographer Lawrence Sher have built this lackluster film around it, but that alone can’t fill two-hours and five minutes of relatively flat acting and lackluster dialogue. “Black Adam” may be doing well at the box office, but the film’s content doesn’t bode well for the continued unfocused DC cinematic universe. In the distant pass, the king of Kahndaq, Ahk-Ton (Marwan Kenzari),  was greedy for more power and decided to create the Crown of Sabbac. He needed the rare mineral Eternium and since it was normal for kings in 2600 BC to have slaves, he had hordes of bald slaves digging and dying for him.  A young man, Hurut (Jason Christian), discovers it and instead of marking the place to mine for a vein, the young Hurut runs around to celebrate. The celebration doesn’t last long because the guards like their slaves docile and silent.  One of the slaves attempts to lead a revolt. Still, the Crown of Sabbac will be forged, but the king of Kahndaq, Ahk-Ton, never gets to wear the crown. He is killed by Teth-Adam. Flash forward to contemporary times, Kahndaq is a land of oppressed people. They have suffered colonization and ruthless gang rule.  An archeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) believes she knows where to the find the crown. She, her brother Karim (Mohammed Amer), and their colleagues Samir (James Cusati-Moyer) and Ishmael (Kenzari) get past the checkpoint guards and drive out into the remote desert where they find a cave within a mountain that has obviously been carved out by men. In there are ancient writings that only Adrianna can read. She finds the crown, but they have been followed and are ambushed. Believing that she can awaken a hero to fight for Kahndaq, she recites the incantation that frees Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) who saves Adrianna by killing the gang members. Teth-Adam save Kahndaq and supernatural power and an ancient statue built of him,  but this guy has been asleep for a few thousand years and a lot has changed. Luckily, Adrianna has a teenaged skateboarding son, Amon, who is a big fan of the DC superheroes who can wise up Teth-Adam. First of all, Teth-Adam needs a tagline, a motto. He also needs to defend himself against the Justice Society: Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo). Teth-Adam’s slaughter of the men at the cave has caught the attention of the US government official (Viola Davis as Amanda Waller) who has sent the Justice Society to get Teth-Adam into custody. This film needs a dose of humor and a questioning if the audience or the world really needs righteous slaughter and the rationale of justified violence. When you consider the talent assembled here who clearly have comedic chops–Johnson, Brosnan and Hodge, it is sad that the humor attempted here falls flat than Wile E. Coyote after he’s been smashed by a falling boulder. Barcelona-born director Jaume Collet-Serra has an eye for action, but for humor, timing is everything and the timing isn’t there despite the credited writing by Adam Sztykiel (“Made of Honor” “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip”) with  Rory Haines and Iranian-American (raised Muslim) Sohrab Noshirvani (“The Mauritanian”). At just over two hours, the film feels long. Be sure to stay for the mid-credits Superman scene. You might think that I and every other Asian American should be rejoicing. DC has been big on diversity with Jason Momoa as Aquaman, but The Rock is overrepresented in Asian American Pacific Islander roles already. And since he and Momoa share a body type this isn’t really diversity when you realize that White guys like Andrew Garfield, Toby Maguire and Tom Holland can play Spider-man. Further, The Rock is a two-fer: He’s both Pacific Islander (Samoan) and African American. Momoa as Aquaman is also Hawaiian and European. They both can come under racially ambiguous. The casting of the principal heroes of the Justice Society  also leans heavily into the binary of Black and White. The Justice Society is composed of two White people–Pierce Brosnan as Kent Nelson/Doctor Fate and Noah Centineo as Albert ‘Al” Rothstein/Adam Smasher–and two Black people–Aldis Hodge as Carter Hall/Hawkman and Quintessa Swindell as Maxine Hunkel/Cyclone. Al Rothstein is supposed to be Jewish, but Centineo is not. Further, their commander is Black, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. It’s worth noting that Carter Hall has been played by a White person (Michael Shanks in “Smallville” and German actor Falk Hentschel in the Arrowverse). Swindell is light-skinned, but Ebony is embracing her and she also brings representation for non-binary people. West Asians are represented in the cast with Sarah Shahi, who is of Iranian descent, Mohammed Amer who is Palestinian American. North Africa is also represented with Tunisian-Dutch actor Marwan Kenzari as Ishmael Gregor/Sabbac. Another Pacific Islander (besides The Rock) plays a pivotal role: Uli Latukefu as the superhero form of Jason Christian’s Hurut, but Latukefu also plays The Rock in the TV series. What isn’t represented is East Asians. And that is underlined by the side trip Black Adam/Teth-Adam takes to a picaresque valley with a thatched roof hut. The dubbed in voices spoke Mandarin. That might not be apparent to most of the audience. There is East Asian representation in “Shazam” with Ian Chen as Eugene Choi, but was there an East Asian wizard in the Council of Wizards?  In “Shazam,” the last surviving member of the council was played by Djimon Hounsou who also appears prominently  in “Black Adam.” What is also problematic here is that The Rock may be part African American, but African Americans do not claim North Africa where the majority of Egypt’s land mass is located. Generally African Americans are those who come from Sub-Saharan Africa. North Africans are effectively disenfranchised from the continent as a result. Similarly, West Asians are separated out from Asia which, in the US, most commonly refers to East Asia and in more recent times has also included South Asia and Southeast Asia. West Asians are left without a continent in a manner similar to North Africans as a result. In the US, there’s been a movement to pull this population from the category of White into Middle East North African (MENA) and with the recent wars in West Asia and the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorism, it has become obvious that the MENA American population does face prejudice. “Black Adam” leans heavily into the binary of Black and White diversity. The so-called smashing of barriers by Swindell seems more like an expansion of that binary definition of diversity and to a certain extent so does the casting of The Rock. Should Johnson be playing a character who is supposedly of North African or West Asian? How many West Asian or North African superheroes are there and how many heroes are being played by actors of West Asian or North African descent? Moreover, if Carter Hall can be played by a Black person, then why not another ethnic minority, including West Asian? In addition, the one Jewish hero, is not played by someone who is Jewish (Noah Centineo as Albert ‘Al” Rothstein/Adam Smasher) although there are many actors of Jewish heritage and some have shown up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. (e.g. Jake Gyllenhaal or Andrew Garfield).  Henry Winkler, who is of German Jewish descent, does play Adam Smasher’s uncle and supposedly the previous Adam Smasher, but is that really enough? Is this any better than having the lead in “Prince of Persia” played by Jake Gyllenhaal? Shouldn’t we want actors of West Asian and North African have the opportunity to play something other than terrorists? “Black Adam” should have been the opportunity for someone of Egyptian or of Arab descent and Muslim to portray a superhero. “Black Adam” fully uses The Rock’s smolder  but it could have been bolder by casting choices that would have smashed the Black and White diversity paradigm. Under the direction Collet-Serra, the film is a bloated two-hours and five minutes. “Black Adam” could have been leaner and it continues the tone of meaner than the MCU. I did not receive an invitation to a studio press screening and this seemed to be not uncommon. “Black Adam” opened on 21 October 2022."
"Nov 4, 2022",neutral," This Week: Kevin is getting whipped up in a frenzy about Halloween, and he gets all excited over the box office because of all the horror films in the line-up. Then, he looks at new trailers for M3GAN and Creed III. Next, he offers a rundown of the Halloween options in the different streaming services. Later, he reviews Black Adam, Ticket to Paradise and Tár. Finally, he wraps things up with the Home-Cinema Round-Up and a spotlight on William Castle’s House on Haunted Hill. Disagree on TAR. Film requires you to be attentive and does not give lots of answers. Your review of this was laughable.  big thumbs down. Agree on Tar. Too long, too sluggish up front and pretentious, just as you said. I already knew Cate Blanchette could act. Conducting and piano playing scenes were cringe worthy."

Funny, I kept thinking the same thing about a self-absorbed movie “critic” who views everything through a Marvel lens and thereby reveling that he has not a single clue about comic book characters and their history. And didn’t bother to do the research of he had SO many questions. SPOT ON!!!! Millions of dollars are at their disposal, a decent enough cast, and this is the best they can come up with… I don’t get it. Deeply embarrassing. I can’t believe that you have a job as a movie critic. Your bias is clearly visible and if you can’t go into a movie to critic it for the type of movie it is and know the genre you are supposed to review with out an obvious bias. You don’t deserve to call yourself a critic much less have some one waste their money paying you. This is a DC movie not a marvel movie. Stop trying to compare this like it’s a marvel movie. You shouldn’t even be a critic and review movies. You probably just a little bit salty that they don’t have any kind of woke politics in this movie. Looks to me like Marvel exists because it stole all of DC’s ideas.
You obviously have no idea of Comic/Super Hero history and are a shill for Marvel.
It is clear there is no one functioning as an Editor at your organization if they let this pile of misinformation be published. For anyone in the comments saying there’s a critic bias here – I just want to say I have the exact same opinion as he does. And I’m a DC fan.  DC makes shit movies. Marvel’s movies also suck, but suck less than this.
I just wish this whole superhero era of movies will end soon, so we can get back to quality films.  P.S. The Joker was a pretentious piece of shit that tried so so hard to be art that it was embarrasing. If it wasn’t for Phoenix it would have flopped.

"Nov 2, 2022",positive," While DC continuously changes its structure behind the scenes, a project fifteen years in the making finally arrives in theaters. And Jaume Collet-Serra‘s Black Adam is full of charismatic action, although time will tell if the studio is actually headed in the right direction this time. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson leads a fun cast who have enough charm to carry what would otherwise be a generic super hero outing, but the film successfully manages to keep the world-threatening stakes personal enough to make the characters worth caring for. An ancient, powerful being has been unleashed in the DC Extended Universe, with an origin story made to be enjoyed with the biggest popcorn bucket you can find. While the movie was trapped in development hell for the better part of two decades, Dwayne Johnson remained proud of the vision he and Warner Bros. had for this story. The result is not as earth-shattering as promised, but the performance delivered by the lead star demonstrates how much he cared about portraying Teth-Adam on the big screen. Plenty of Johnson‘s characters appear to have the same personality across his filmography, but in this instance an effort for this anti-hero to stand out from the rest of the smoldering bike riders can be perceived.source: Warner Bros PicturesAlmost three thousand years ago, Teth-Adam is a slave in the nation of Kahndaq. After his son, Kurut, (Jalon Christian) transfers the power of Shazam (yes, as in, Zachary Levi‘s Shazam) to him in order to save his life, Adam is forced to watch his only child die in his arms, prompting him to level the city in search of revenge. This forces the wizards who grant these powers to imprison him due to considering his bloodthirst unworthy. In the present, after a heist goes wrong inside the ruins of the temple where he was banished , Teth-Adam sees the light of day once again.The Rock portrays Adam with an unfamiliar gravity. It was interesting to see the actor lean into a more serene presence on-screen. The character doesn’t need to look at the camera and remind us how powerful he is, that is rather proven with his actions. And, with a very good notion of how someone who has possessed such abilities for a long time might carry himself, Johnson plays Adam wreaking havoc with the mundane attitude of someone walking their dog.The Humor Doesn’t Overstay its WelcomeThe first two acts of Black Adam didn’t have the right to be as amusing as they are. Adam is able to roam through the streets of Kahndaq for the first time in millennia, and he will do his best to understand how humanity has changed since then. A fish out of water routine for characters who jump across big periods of time can get exhausting relatively quickly. But in this case, the movie doesn’t dumb Adam down and the humor shines because he can understand most of what he sees, he simply doesn’t care as long as it doesn’t help him bring honor to his home.source: Warner Bros. PicturesAldis Hodges’ Hawkman is the highlight of the Justice Society of America, a team of super heroes who have existed in the DCEU for a very long time, but are only now appearing, being mentioned or making themselves useful. Sketchy introductions aside, the Society is only there to make Adam look better but thankfully, they are not thrown under the bus. Whether they are the anti-hero’s punching bags or allies, the JSA keep Teth-Adam with his feet on the ground (even though he adores to hover randomly throughout the film to remind us that he can fly).  Thankfully, Noah Centineo‘s Atom Smasher functions as a way more likable version of Deadpool, and his heavy-handedness can attributed to his youth and lack of experience, instead of acting that way due to having an annoying personality.But it is Bodhi Sabongui‘s character, Amon Tomaz, who has the best dynamic with Johnson‘s electrifying protagonist. Amon is the young son of a university professor who happens to help Adam and the JSA in their quest for an ancient relic. Since he is a huge fan of superheroes (DC super heroes, of course), he is more than thrilled to get to know Adam and show him the ropes regarding super-powered individual etiquette. The two share very humorous back-and-forths and Adam protecting the boy and learning pop culture through him becomes more engaging than saving the planet from absolute destruction.Fair Warning: There’s a Messy Third ActThe point where this narrative closes its second act would’ve been a perfect spot to roll the credits on any other action movie, which is why it was so surprising to find out that the runtime still had a long way to go. The true villain of the movie is reintroduced in his final from, and it is up to the JSA and Adam to stop him. When the final battle feels like a tediously long epilogue, the pacing issues become evident. You want the heroes to win not to prevent the bad guy from obliterating Earth, but to be able to leave your seat. source: Warner Bros. StudiosNevertheless, a bloated conclusion doesn’t take away from the fact that two-thirds of this adventure is pure blockbuster entertainment, with enough explosions, mid-air punches, and laughs to keep wanting more. With a different structure and an extra script revision, this could’ve been a great superhero movie, instead of one that wasn’t terrible. Some of the sparks resembling the deal breaker that The Rock and Warner Bros. are there, but the potential is never reached.The personal stakes are once again highlighted as the core of the movie because when it’s time to stop the giant McGuffin during the third act, the story changes its direction is a questionable manner. Pacing issues aside, we’re not dealing with a climax that spoils the rest of the narrative. Honestly, it wouldn’t be a modern superhero film without earth-shattering punches while everyone is surrounded by raging fire.Conclusion: Black AdamAmusing humor and a very entertaining performance from The Rock consolidate Black Adam as one of the strongest DCEU outings. The film earns its blockbuster status with the kind of explosive action and a fast pace that are best experienced on the biggest screen possible. A convoluted third act doesn’t take away the fun from the first two-thirds of the film, and the portrayal of Tether-Adam is different enough from the rest of the characters Dwayne Johnson has played to keep you invested while you get to know DC’s newest anti-hero.Have you seen Black Adam?

The personal stakes are once again highlighted as the core of the movie because when it’s time to stop the giant McGuffin during the third act, the story changes its direction is a questionable manner. Pacing issues aside, we’re not dealing with a climax that spoils the rest of the narrative.

"Nov 2, 2022",positive,"Been there, done that - still it's ""The Rock"" and it's all a lot of fun."
"Nov 1, 2022",negative," A mostly intolerable DC comics adaptation, Black Adam follows the title figure (Dwayne Johnson) as he’s awoken from a centuries-long slumber and unleashed on the villains menacing his Middle Eastern hometown. Filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra, working from a script by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, kicks Black Adam off with an almost unreasonably exposition-heavy opening stretch that establishes a tone of pervasive self-seriousness, and it’s clear, certainly, that the off-putting vibe is perpetuated by a midsection overflowing with some of the superhero genre’s most generic, run-of-the-mill tropes and conventions – with Collet-Serra’s reliance on computer-generated effects doing little to alleviate the predominantly uninvolving atmosphere. And although there is some novelty in the central character’s less-than-altruistic behavior, at least initially, Black Adam, with its assortment of hopelessly one-note periphery characters, remains entirely unable to grab the viewer’s interest and attention for much of its wildly overlong (and often interminable) 124 minute running time – although, to be fair, the picture does boast a small handful of compelling set-pieces and Johnson’s predictably charming work as the fish-out-of-water protagonist. (Pierce Brosnan, cast as a superhero named Doctor Fate, undoubtedly walks away with the title of MVP, however.) By the time the loud, wildly over-the-top finale rolls around, Black Adam has cemented its place as one of the least impressive comic-book movies to come around in quite some time – which is a shame, ultimately, given the talent both in front of and behind the camera."
"Nov 1, 2022",positive,"There are specks of greatness within the mid-tier story but this DC flick is more entertaining than the past few MCU features, which is saying a lot."
"Oct 31, 2022",negative," These are all statements promoting the latest installment of the DCEU, Black Adam, which premiered in theaters on Friday. They’re also all statements coming from the man portraying Black Adam, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson—and the blockbuster king seems to be pushing a pretty clear agenda about his film shaking up the entire fabric of the DCEU as we know it. As Johnson sees it, Black Adam is positioned to be something of a rebirth for the interconnected superhero franchise at large. “It’s a unique time in the superhero genre, where there’s the introduction of fresh blood and new characters on both sides of the aisle—at Marvel and certainly at DC,” Johnson recently told The New York Times. “And the launching of Black Adam is converging with a time where they are also bringing in new leadership at Warner Bros. and new leadership on the DC side is soon to be coming in. I feel very confident about the direction of the DC universe. It is going to require real strategy and real leadership. And that requires us not to look at Marvel’s success and say, let’s follow that blueprint. That’s Marvel. I’m very happy for them. We don’t want to be Marvel, in my opinion. We want to be DC and we want to do it our way.” As Johnson describes, there’s an ongoing shake-up happening behind the scenes at Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment. Thus, Black Adam is one of the first opportunities to see what the future of Marvel’s top competitor looks like now that Zack Snyder’s hold over the DCEU seemingly concluded upon the release of Zack Snyder’s Justice League. (The only DCEU theatrical release between March 2021’s “Snyder Cut” and Black Adam was James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, which came out last August. The Batman, which was released this March, exists in a cinematic universe of its own.) But as much as Johnson and the film’s marketing have teased a new beginning, Black Adam feels both stuck in the Snyderverse era and unsure of where the DCEU is heading next. Although Black Adam was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who previously teamed up with the Rock for a ride on the Jungle Cruise, I wouldn’t blame you if you thought the new movie was Snyder’s work. The film carries many of the former DCEU visionary’s trademarks: abundant use of dark, cloudy-looking CGI that makes it look like it’s going to rain at any moment; a brooding, self-serious protagonist; and a lot—like a lot—of slow-motion action sequences. The first extended fight featuring Black Adam finds the antihero, fresh off of a 5,000-year nap, moving so quickly that everyone around him is operating at a glacial pace in comparison; with all the bolts of lightning added into the mix, it sure looks like the visual language Snyder used to display the Flash’s movements. But even more puzzling than the recycled visual style are the film’s attempts to be a world-building platform for the DCEU and its future projects. Along with its titular antihero, Black Adam introduces the Justice Society of America—a team of superheroes with a comics history that dates further back than the Justice League’s. There’s also the outsize presence of Task Force X, the government-issued name for the so-called Suicide Squad, with Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) continuing her prolific role as something of a more ruthless version of Nick Fury. Then there are the expected ties to the Shazam! franchise, with Black Adam alter ego Teth-Adam’s origins—and the source of his powers—aligning with those of Shazam alter ego Billy Batson. And lastly, there’s Superman. We’ll get to talking about Superman, don’t you worry. Those are a lot of moving parts to fit into an origin story about a little-known title character, and as charismatic (and superhuman, even before the CGI) as the Rock is, even he can’t carry all the additional weight they bring into a narrative that spans thousands of years. By no real fault of Johnson’s, the JSA is the most interesting aspect of Black Adam—and yet the team also has something of an odd debut. It’s positioned as a new group in the DCEU, but given its ties to Waller and the presumed experience of veteran members Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), the JSA also appears to have been active for quite some time. The JSA effectively fills the vacuum left by the Justice League—but the film never really addresses that, either. Given how much effort Black Adam devotes to introducing the JSA, it wouldn’t surprise me to learn Black Adam v The Justice Society: Dusk of Justice was a potential title at some point in the creative process. Meanwhile, Task Force X appears multiple times in the film, though only as an extension of the U.S. government; there aren’t any surprise Harley Quinn or Weasel sightings here. Waller sends the JSA to Black Adam’s native land of Kahndaq once she learns that the legendary figure has reawakened, and her subordinate Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) returns for a brief cameo after last appearing on Gunn’s Peacemaker series. However, the film all but ignores the events of Peacemaker, which ended with Waller’s daughter Adebayo revealing her mother’s international crimes and the unethical nature of Task Force X for the entire world to see. Waller seems to have more power than ever in Black Adam, and it appears that Harcourt’s transgressions in The Suicide Squad—which relegated her to working with a vigilante like Peacemaker—are either forgiven or forgotten. It remains to be seen whether the upcoming Shazam! Fury of the Gods can replicate the success of its predecessor, but the foundations are laid for Black Adam and Shazam to meet down the road given their shared origins. However, the bigger crossover setup in Black Adam is centered on a different superhero: Superman. The Last Son of Krypton returns for the first time since the Justice League films, not counting the character’s (but not Cavill’s) cameo as a non-speaking silhouette at the end of Peacemaker. (Although Snyder’s slightly improved, extremely lengthy version came out last year, the messy Joss Whedon Cut was released in 2017.) The crossover appearance doesn’t come as much of a shock after how much Johnson has teased it, but it is something of a surprise to see Henry Cavill back in the red-and-blue tights once again. (While we’re here, remember the mustache debacle?) The film’s post-credits scene lays the groundwork for a forthcoming battle between Black Adam and Superman, as Waller warns Kahndaq’s protector that she can phone in a favor from an otherworldly figure who stands as a worthy opponent to him. With Superman and Black Adam meeting face to face as the stinger comes to a close, the showdown has already been set; at this point, it’s pretty much just a matter of when and where it will happen. All of this is to say that Black Adam is a busy movie. There’s a lot crammed into a running time that barely eclipses the two-hour mark, and when you combine all the world-building elements with an origin story that isn’t as novel as it makes itself out to be, the result is pretty messy—another trait this film shares with the majority of those in the Snyderverse era that it’s supposed to be moving on from. But when you consider that the Justice League appeared during a cameo at the end of Peacemaker earlier this year; Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and the untitled Wonder Man sequel are both still in the works; The Flash is still somehow not canceled despite the ever-growing controversies surrounding Ezra Miller; and a sequel to 2013’s Man of Steel was recently announced; the question is: Has the Snyderverse era ended at all? It doesn’t seem like even those working at Warner Bros. Discovery know the answer, and the real explanation lies somewhere amid the chaos behind the scenes of the volatile DCEU. As Warner Bros. Discovery CEO and president David Zaslav explained during a company earnings call in August, a long-term strategy is already in motion. “We have done a reset. We’ve structured the business,” Zaslav announced. “There will be a team with a 10-year plan focusing just on DC. It’s very similar to the structure that Alan Horn and Bob Iger put together very effectively with Kevin Feige at Disney. We think we could build a long-term, much more sustainable growth business out of DC, and as part of that, we’re going to focus on quality. We’re not going to release any film before it’s ready.” Despite Johnson’s aforementioned comments suggesting the contrary, Black Adam signals DC’s attempt at creating the kind of long-term plan that Marvel executed so effectively during its decade-long Infinity Saga. The problem is, this isn’t a hard reset, as Zaslav and Johnson are promoting. You can call it Phase 1 if you like, but DC’s previous Snyderverse era is as alive as ever—even if Snyder is out of the picture. And while the MCU has grown more inconsistent during Phase 4, the Multiverse Saga at least has three phases of films and a number of wildly successful crossover events to build on. DC Entertainment is starting its “reset” with a multiverse approach of parallel cinematic universes despite a shaky foundation, and the future of the DCEU has never been less clear. With The Suicide Squad, its spinoffs, and a secret project in the works, James Gunn has carved out his own corner of the DCEU, and the prominence of Task Force X in Black Adam seems to suggest that Gunn’s role could expand. Following the success of The Batman earlier this year, director Matt Reeves is creating a Bat-Verse that exists on its own, with a planned project centered on Colin Farrell’s Penguin the first of several spinoffs to come. And three years into Bad Robot’s contract with Warner Bros., without a film or series to show for it, J.J. Abrams’s ambitious Justice League Dark plans may or may not ever come to fruition. (Relatedly: R.I.P., Batman: Caped Crusader, we hardly knew ye.) The real issue looming behind Zaslav’s supposed 10-year plan, of course, is the fact that there isn’t a Feige-like figure to lead the DCEU into a new era in the first place. With Walter Hamada quietly ending his tenure as head of DC Films this past week, there’s a leadership vacuum that has yet to be filled despite Warner Bros. Discovery’s best efforts. Producer Dan Lin was reportedly close to signing a deal to take over the position at DC Films in August, but the deal fell through and the search continues, with Warner Bros. Pictures head Michael De Luca serving in the interim. Despite all the internal chaos, including canceled projects like the Batgirl movie, the DCEU is still pushing ahead, and creators are seizing their chance to scoop up valuable IP in the process. “Right now it’s the Wild West,” an insider at Warner Bros. Discovery told The Hollywood Reporter. “Everyone is trying to grab as much as they can. And this is exactly what happens in a leadership vacuum.” It’s only fitting that Black Adam is as messy as it is, considering it’s caught between the old DCEU and whatever we could call this new era. Perhaps even more appropriate is the fact that in spite of a 39 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of publication, the film just enjoyed the best domestic debut for any Johnson-led blockbuster, after previous critically panned entries like the original Suicide Squad defied reviews to fare well in theaters. How Black Adam, which has yet to receive a release date in China, continues to perform after its opening weekend may be telling, but Johnson’s star power alone seems to be enough to keep the franchise going as the Rock becomes entrenched in the DCEU. There’s a scene midway through Black Adam that serves as an apt, almost on-the-nose representation of the limbo the DCEU finds itself in and what this film is attempting to do. In a classic superhero trope, two “good guys” are fighting each other before inevitably finding peace through an alliance against a common enemy, as Hawkman and Black Adam bring their storied rivalry from the comics to the big screen for the first time. This fight occurs in a child’s bedroom, covered wall to wall with Justice League memorabilia. As they duke it out—in slow motion, of course—the camera lingers on posters and figurines of Aquaman, Wonder Man, Superman, and Batman, with two new DC heroes literally tearing down the old guard. Black Adam wins, solidifying his case to sit atop the hierarchy of power in the DC Universe. Before we can care about Black Adam taking on Superman, though, Warner Bros. Discovery needs to figure out what it wants that universe to be. Rachel and Callie discuss the Bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes. Then, Jodi hops on to talk ‘The Valley’ and ‘Vanderpump Rules.’"
"Oct 31, 2022",positive," I was able to see this film opening night. I was pleasantly surprised how much this film worked for me.  Black Adam stars Dwayne Johnson who has been cast as the titular character for well over a decade, and he made it a memorable one. This film had some of the best action and visuals I have seen in a superhero movie in a while. In an age where DC has been pushed and raked through the coals countless times by critics, this was a breath of fresh air. Johnson commands the scene with every ounce of his body and it is seen here.  Another wonderful addition to this movie is the use of the JSA. The characters were engaging with a solid casting of Aldis Hodge, Pierce Brosnan, and Quintessa Swindell taking on other superheroes in this film. They added stakes and humor that was welcomed and needed in the always sullen DC films we’ve gotten in the past. The only real issue I have are the non superhero characters who came off as one note or annoying. Going past all that though, this film is absolutely a blast and should be seen in theaters. Dwayne Johnson has shown that if we wait for him to don the suit, he will deliver. Watch Black Adam on the biggest screen you can!"
"Oct 31, 2022",positive," Yes, “Black Adam,” Dwayne Johnson has been freed from his tomb for almost 5,000 years and is ready to seek justice for his people of Kahndaq with his colossal powers. “Black Adam” sets up the realm of the “DC Extended Universe” with a surprise during the middle of the ending credits. I enjoyed the illustrious special effects and the non-stop action. The film is playing in theaters now and is not for children due to its violence. Directed by “Jungle Cruise” and “Orphan” filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra, Johnson plays Teth-Adam, a former slave who was granted the powers of Egyptian gods to protect humanity. Although his homeland of Kahndaq is destroyed after he seeks vengeance for his murdered family. He’s awakened by an archaeologist searching for a powerful relic to free Kahndaq from a vicious mercenary network. Teth-Adam’s explosive resurrection and the mercenaries’ slaughter soon puts him on the watch list of the Justice Society of America, (JSA) a team of superheroes who maintain international peace—their task is to decide whether Teth-Adam is a potential enemy or ally to the world. Aldis Hodge (“Straight Outta Compton,” “One Night in Miami”) costars as JSA leader Carter Hall (aka Hawkman), along with Pierce Brosnan (“Mama Mia”) as the superhero sorcerer Kent Nelson (aka Doctor Fate), Quintessa Swindell (“Voyagers”) as wind-swirling hero Maxine Hunkel (aka Cyclone), and Noah Centineo (“To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before”) as supersize-changing, hero Al Rothstein (aka Atom Smasher). Other key characters include Sarah Shahi (“Sex/Life”) portrays the archaeologist who awakens Teth-Adam, Bodhi Sabongui (“The Baby-Sitters Club”) plays her son; and comedian and actor Mohammed Amer (Mo) plays her brother. Marwan Kenzari (“Aladdin”) plays the Intergang member on the hunt for a powerful relic known as the Crown of Sabbac. The tone of “Black Adam” is of comical superhero shenanigans, although it’s also dark and gritty, with CG-fueled, combative action at its core. Johnson’s Teth-Adam reminds us that’s he, not a hero. Johnson is one of the most adept combat actors in Hollywood these days. Therefore it’s fitting he has his own movie, although his tireless efforts to project himself as a family guy, a dad, etc., conflicts with the violence of his character. Again, the film is not for kids."
"Oct 31, 2022",neutral,"Black Adam is, in a way, a hero for modern times in America, at least for those who want to take the law into their own hands, tear down this country and remake it into something more like Russia or China."
"Oct 30, 2022",negative," The movie poses (but doesn't follow up on) interesting questions about good and evil, such as who decides what's good and what's evil, and is itOK to cross the line between the two if good comes out of it? Also: What if there's no such thing as absolutes? The superheroes are all brave and try to do what they think is right, even though they sometimes make mistakes. And they all seem open to learning, even if things are sometimes ambiguous. Adrianna is central to the plot, both as a voice for moral inquiry about military occupation and political resistance and for family unity. The setting of Kahndaq is a fictional place, but it's populated by a diverse group of actors/characters, including star Dwayne Johnson, co-stars Aldis Hodge and Sarah Shahi, and many more. Women characters have power and agency, especially Adrianna, who is a strong, brave leader. The main group of superheroes does include two White men. But the movie's story puts decisions in the hands of local people, rather than White interlopers. A heavyset character is portrayed as lovably comic/ridiculous. High body count, and lots of guns and shooting. Characters get shot, and there are bloody wounds. Frequent fighting, punching, kicking, bashing against surfaces, hitting with blunt objects. Character grabbed by throat, electrocuted, turned into skeleton. Character sliced by blade. Child shot with arrow. Severed hand. Character stabbed and thrown over cliff, with blood trailing after him. A character thrown from a mountaintop lands with an icky thud. Cars and other vehicles crash. Zombies. Some symbology/imagery traditionally associated with satanism. Parents need to know that Black Adam is a DC Extended Universe superhero movie, and a spin-off from Shazam!. Dwayne Johnson stars as the title character, who was originally a supervillain in DC comics. The movie has a diverse cast and asks interesting questions about heroes and villains, but it ultimately becomes a dull smash-and-bash-fest without much time for character development or anything else. Expect large-scale action violence, with explosions/destruction, guns and shooting, and lots of fighting. Many characters (including women and children) are killed, sometimes in gruesome -- though bloodless -- ways: electrocution, stabbing, etc. Language includes occasional use of ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""bastard,"" ""piss,"" ""damn,"" and ""hell."" There's a bit of flirting, and several posters and toys depicting other DC characters are shown in a boy's room. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. BLACK ADAM begins 5,000 years ago, with the city of Kahndaq ruled by a tyrant who works to build a magical crown that will give him great powers. A boy sparks rebellion, and, just as the tyrant is about to don the special crown, the boy is given the powers of Shazam! to save the day. In the present day, the crown re-surfaces, and Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is summoned once again. But, rather than a hero, he appears to be a killer, dispatching everyone who tries to get in his way. The crown temporarily ends up in the hands of powerful resistance fighter Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), whose rebellious son, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), believes that Teth-Adam can be the city's hero. Meanwhile, the Justice Society -- comprised of Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) -- has been called in to deal with what they see as a threat. But something even worse is on the horizon. Occasionally exploring themes of what it means to be heroic or villainous, with shades of gray in between, this superhero movie collapses into a boring bash-fest with barely any time to breathe. Like many other villain-as-protagonist movies, ranging from Venom and Morbius to Maleficent and Cruella, Black Adam takes the opportunity to explore such questions as ""Who decides who the 'good guy' is?"" And ""Is it OK to hurt people if some good comes out of it?"" Unfortunately, once the movie asks those questions, it forgets all about them as the characters whiz around the screen, hammering away at one another, as well as any solid object that happens to be in the way. In this movie, bodies and debris soar far more frequently than viewers' spirits. It's safe to say that the majority of Black Adam's running time consists of fights, chases or battles, and sections of blocky exposition. Much is made of what's supposed to be a tender friendship between Hawkman and Dr. Fate, but we never feel this; it's only told to us through dialogue and goopy music in rare moments between punches. The same goes for a sweet friendship/romance between Cyclone and Atom Smasher; it's just too scarce and fragmented to amount to much. Even the human characters are cookie cutters, from the generic movie ""kid"" to the lovably comic uncle, rotund and ridiculous (though the actors playing both parts give them their all!). As far as Black Adam goes, those who enjoy The Rock's comedic chops and charismatic smirk may be surprised to encounter an antihero who's stoic in the face of loss and trauma. Unfortunately, though, viewers never really learn who he is or what he wants to be, and that question is ultimately less intriguing than it is uninteresting. Families can talk about Black Adam's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? How does the representation in the cast of this movie compare to other superhero films you've seen? Why is positive representation important in the media?

"Oct 28, 2022",positive," The latest origin story for the DC Comics cinematic universe introduces a lot of characters, has to thread the needle with its title character and sometimes suffers from the need to have a little too much exposition. Yet it all manages to work thanks to some solid action sequences and a game cast led by Johnson. “Black Adam” traces the title character back to his roots – beginning as Teth-Adam who is given the powers of Shazam and transferred into a super hero to save Kahndaq from a tyrannical king. Fast forward 5,000 years and Kahndaq is still under siege, this time by mercenaries, with a local archaeologist named Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) trying to locate a crown that is believed to have mystical powers. Her search leads her to free Teth-Adam, now ready to unleash his powers on the modern day. As he learns the ways of the modern world, Teth-Adam interacts with Adrianna, her son (Bodhi Sabongui) and a group of superheros known as Justice Society of America – Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell). The journey to the screen for “Black Adam” has taken many turns with Johnson originally slated to appear in “Shazam” as the villain before plans were changed to give the character a stand-alone movie. The Justice Society was added later in one of the final drafts to give the film another dimension. All of these revisions are relevant, especially in the first part as “Black Adam” tries to find its legs. The character is now more of an anti-hero learning to be a good guy. It’s a character development that could be tricky, but Johnson has the charisma and charm to pull it off. The inclusion of the Justice Society also gives “Black Adam” a much-needed boost. I really enjoyed their interactions with Black Adam and look forward to possible spin-off films featuring these characters (Swindell is the standout in the quartet). I’ll concede the final villain doesn’t get the same kind of depth as the other characters and is a little too CGI reliant to be very memorable, but it builds to a mid-credit scene that could be a game changer for DC films to come. It’s a perfect way for “Black Adam” to stick the landing. The film might not always hit the right notes, but ultimately it serves its purpose as a solid origin story that has plenty of room for growth and expansion."
"Oct 28, 2022",positive," The latest offering from the DC comics movie universe explores the darkness that anyone can experience when facing betrayal, grief, anger or other anything else stemming from painful events or happenings in life. With the right people to help and an open heart, even those experiences can hold sparks of hope. Such is the story of Black Adam. Let's be honest from the very start. Teth Adam (Dwayne Johnson), as he's called throughout the film, is not a hero, he's an anti-hero – with hero potential. He's portrayed, not as evil, but as super angry and the anger causes him to do some really bad things. Welcome to Kahndaq, Black Adam's home. Imagine a Middle Eastern-like country that has been under oppression for centuries. And the suffering people have been in rebellion against their oppressors for just as long. In the present day, the rebellion is led by Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), an Indiana Jones-type who wants to find the crown of Eternium, forged by an evil king in days past.  The crown and the right words – Shazam! – will call forth a long-banished Champion. What she gets is Teth Adam, full of anger at his 5,000-year exile who immediately starts killing everyone in sight with his lightning bolts of doom. Enter the JSA, the Justice Society of America, whose mission it is to keep beings like Teth Adam in check. Dispatched to Kahndaq are Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), and Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan). Fate and Hawkman have been around for a while and are the best of friends. Cyclone and Atom Smasher are the new kids on the block. Atom Smasher is literally slipping into his superhero suit for the very first time. His bumbling attempts at herodom provide some light in the darkness. For a believing audience, the ethics of this film present a quandry. Adrianna's son, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), idolizes Adam. After all, he's supposed to be the champion the people have been waiting for. Meanwhile, Hawkman is trying to get it through Adam's thick skull that heroes don't kill people. Well, Adam is having none of that, seeking only to wreak havoc on the current tormentors of his homeland, Intergang and their leader Ishmael (Marwan Kenzari). But the JSA doesn't quit, aiding in the fight against Intergang but without the whole killing people thing. Casting someone as physically daunting as Dwaye ""The Rock"" Johnson in the role of Black Adam was a stroke of genius but the script gives him little to do but scowl and look menacing. Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate provides the best performance, looking debonaire and put together, even as he struggles to convince Adam that he can become the champion that his people need, that he can transform from seeking revenge to serving his people rather than himself. Parents, be aware that this film is not for young ones. There's quite a body count while Black Adam tries to get his priorities straight and in the pre-historic preamble to the film a boy gets stabbed and thrown off a cliff. Not pretty. If you decide to let your older kids see the film, it provides a great opportunity to have a conversation about what it means to admire someone for their wrongdoing and what it is that can attract us to such characters or people. After all, none of us is totally void of wrongdoing in our lives. We all have had experiences of anger, grief, betrayal stemming from painful events or happenings. What we do with those emotions is up to us. Just know that in the darkness there are always sparks of hope, people or thoughts we can hold onto to get us through the dark times. For us believers, the glimmers that keep us going are gifts from our loving God who always holds us in the palm of his hand, leading us from darkness into light.

"Oct 28, 2022",negative," The outcome of all this is never in question, of course. The plotting here is so basic any third grader could explain the story beats before they happen. Which is a shame because director Jaume Collet-Serra is a gifted craftsman who deserves much better than this, because his talents are both wasted and buried beneath layers of ugly CGI, an overbearing score, and a story that makes the proverbial dull dishwater look positively vibrant.  Does anyone actually care about these movies? How many times can you watch the same thing over and over before getting tired of it? Do audiences really not want something that's actually surprising? Or are studios just lazy, continuing to churn out formulaic dreck because it's tried and true and they know it sells tickets? Everything about Black Adam is bullshit - there's no heart, no soul, not an honest moment in the whole thing. Johnson does his best -  and he's undeniably magnetic, especially in Adam's early, more ominous scenes that allow him to try on a new screen persona for a bit. But by the time the villain finally shows up in the final act, it's almost impossible to care about any of it because we've seen it all before in movies that weren't nearly so goofy. Black Adam is as paint-by-numbers as these things get."
"Oct 28, 2022",negative," There’s nothing so wrong with “Black Adam” that it should be avoided, but nothing—besides the appealing presence of Dwayne Johnson—that makes it worth rushing out to see. The movie’s many small flaws—and even its few small virtues—arise from its one big problem, namely, its positioning in the DC corporate-cinematic empire. It isn’t worse than many of the big-budget C.G.I. superhero spectacles that have more or less taken over studio filmmaking, but it accumulates the genre’s—and the business’s—bad habits into a single two-hour-plus package, and only hints at the format’s occasional pleasures. “Black Adam” feels like a place-filler for a movie that’s remaining to be made, but, in its bare and shrugged-off sufficiency, it does one positive thing that, if nothing else, at least accounts for its success: for all the churning action and elaborately jerry-rigged plot, there’s little to distract from the movie’s pedestal-like display of Johnson, its real-life superhero. It begins with an immense backstory of mumbo-jumbo, set in 2600 B.C.E., in a fictitious Middle Eastern or North African land called Kahndaq, where a tyrant named Ahk-Ton (Marwan Kenzari) enslaves his subjects to dig for a mineral called Eternium with which he’ll forge a superpowered crown. One young subject, however, rebels and exhorts his countrymen to revolt; he is endowed with his own superheroic power that’s summoned with the word “shazam,” and, in the resulting melee, Akh-Ton is killed and his palace is blown to rubble. Flash forward to present-day Kahndaq: it’s occupied by a paramilitary crime ring called Intergang, and a trio of dissidents led by an archeologist named Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), and helped by her teen-age son, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), are searching, among remote subterranean ruins, for the crown in the hope of its aiding their resistance. When Intergang follows and attacks them there, she summons (“Shazam!”) the hero of 2600 B.C.E., Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson), from his four thousand-plus of years in an underground tomb. He emerges and lays waste to the assailants. But this seemingly invulnerable liberator, who catches R.P.G.s and hurls blue thunderbolts, is viewed with suspicion by the American agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, reprising this role from the two recent Suicide Squad movies). In order to stop him, she unites the so-called Justice Society—Carter Hall, a.k.a. Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), who’s endowed with wings and a beak; Kent Nelson, a.k.a. Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), who, by means of his golden helmet, can see the future; Maxine Hunkel, a.k.a. Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), who swirls up devastating green windstorms; and Al Rothstein, a.k.a. Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), who can expand to the size of a city walkup, or taller. (Al’s uncle gets a seconds-long cameo, and it’s one of the movie’s few highlights: Henry Winkler.) That’s where the movie’s philosophical dimension comes in. Teth-Adam is an angry man, still seething over what happened in ancient Kahndaq, and his mores are atavistic, with no compunctions about the use of violence, the practice of killing, the collateral damage of mass destruction. (He also sees a TV set for the first time—which, with primeval wisdom, he blasts to smithereens.) But the Justice Society protests: they believe, as Hawkman says, in “due process,” and they warn him to lay off the “extrajudicial killings.” Try as they might, they can’t rein the invulnerable fighter in by force, but, when he himself recognizes the danger posed by his rage, he allows himself to be reëntombed—and gagged—in order not to utter the magic word again. Then a brutal revenant from early Kahndaq seeks—with the aid of smoldering, ancient zombies—to restore Akh-Ton’s dynasty, and the Justice Society needs Teth-Adam back. In contrast to the 2019 movie “Shazam!,” which treats its premise with an apt silliness that yields an unusually amiable superhero comedy, “Black Adam,” sparked by its historical backstory and its enduring implications in current-day political conflict, has a thudding earnestness that its specifics belie. Thus, Davis and Hodge offer performances of grand severity (Davis’s diction alone could smash concrete) that belong to the Shakespearean movie in which neither has yet been cast. Brosnan coasts charmingly in a role that offers him nothing but elegant manners; Swindell and Centineo are part of a Y.A. romance that’s itself entombed in anticipation of a sequel. As for Johnson, he has the star power and the physical prowess to hold attention with minimal fuss, but the role itself, with its tragic implications and mighty gestures, is rote and empty. (I’m still waiting for Johnson to find his way into another movie that offers him as exuberant a showcase as did “Pain and Gain”; his talent is far greater than most of his vehicles, no pun intended.) Teth-Adam’s struggles with himself, the weight of his memories, the rise of self-awareness, even the simple fact of his encounters with a new world (trivialized in a single line of dialogue) turn the hero into a mere plaything of the rickety plot, which appears to add its byways as part of a just-so story crafted to yield a franchise. If the wry details that glitter on the movie’s surface—such as Amon’s effort to teach Teth-Adam the proper use of a catchphrase, or Teth-Adam’s introduction to the concept of sarcasm—stand out in memory, it’s because the substance that it attaches to dries up and blows away like the ashes of half the universe at the end of “Avengers: Infinity War.” What “Black Adam” lacks is the sense of a point of view; even the Russo brothers’ armchair-army bluster in Marvel epics suggests a greater sense of personality, of personal commitment and aesthetic attitude, than the synthetic enormity of “Black Adam.” Jaume Collet-Serra, the movie’s director, comes off as a skillful coördinator whose connection to the very essence of superheroes, their fantastic natures and outsized powers, seems merely technical, a problem to be solved rather than a realm of limitless possibilities. Those limitless possibilities are part of the reason that superhero movies aptly wore out their critical welcomes very quickly. As ultra-high-budget tentpole productions meant for international consumption, these films have production demands that tend to dominate the imagination of direction, with only a few notable exceptions, such as “Ant-Man,” “Black Panther,” and “Man of Steel” (or, for that matter, brief exceptional interludes within unexceptional films, such as “Doctor Strange”). There’s something morally deadening and aesthetically depressing about the bottomless toy chest of C.G.I. being reduced to the toolbox of cinematic bureaucracy.

"Oct 28, 2022",negative," Movies in the DC Extended Universe, Warner Bros. Pictures’ superhero franchise, usually suffer from self-importance and uneven pacing. The one exception was 2019’s Shazam!—a movie about a kid who turns into an adult superhero when he gets magic powers from a wizard. Black Adam, starring Dwayne Johnson, is supposedly a sequel to Shazam!—don’t expect to actually see Zachary Levi’s Shazam—but despite some attempts at levity, the movie feels more like the DCEU’s drearier films. Black Adam is set in Khandaq—a fictional Middle Eastern country oppressed by a multinational criminal organization known as Intergang. Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), an archeologist with anti-colonialism views, thinks she can save her country by digging up magical relics. Instead, she unleashes an ancient super-powered being, Black Adam (Johnson). He has Shazam’s godlike powers, but Adam used them recklessly, so he’s spent most of the last 5,000 imprisoned by the wizard who granted him those powers. Adrianna, along with her son (Bodhi Sabongui) and brother (Mohammed Amer, who might be the best part of the movie), must convince Adam to help Khandaq before their oppressors become all powerful. The United States government complicates the situation by sending the Justice Society of America—not to be confused with the Justice League of America—to neutralize this new superhuman threat. The JSA, making its cinematic debut, comprises Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo). Black Adam is somewhat entertaining, but the movie feels like a missed opportunity. A good film is hiding in this mess somewhere, but director Jaume Collet-Serra just couldn’t find it.  The movie wants to say important things—never a good idea in the superhero genre—but the political messaging gets muddled in the clumsy script. Characters spout rhetoric blaming the world’s problems on colonialism. Good characters say Khandaq needs freedom, especially in the face of what’s portrayed as police brutality. The villain says Khandaq “used to be something better than free”—he wants to make Khandaq great again.  The JSA and Adam face a moral quandary. The JSA doesn’t kill, but Adam does. Adam intervenes on behalf of the oppressed, but the JSA doesn’t. But tossing these ethical and political tropes into the script ends in empty signaling because the movie doesn’t grapple with any of them. The filmmakers use talking points from the political left, but they arrange them so poorly that a far-right viewer could interpret Black Adam as suggesting nationalistic uprising is the proper response to tyranny imposed by multicultural forces. Inept political subtext isn’t the only thing that hurts Black Adam. Despite the action, the movie gets boring. Only die-hard comics fans have heard of Black Adam or the JSA, so the movie wastes time on DC lore and backstory with tedious flashbacks and exposition. The action sequences sound one note—big. The big battle at the end isn’t really any bigger than the big battle in the beginning or the big battle in the middle. Having a main character with limitless power lowers the stakes on fight scenes, no matter how big. I hate to say it because I’m a fan of The Rock, but the biggest problem with Black Adam is probably Dwayne Johnson. Johnson’s one of the film’s producers, and this movie has been a passion project for him. In the comics, Black Adam is something of an antihero, but Johnson attempts to turn him into a character who can carry the weight of the struggling DC franchise. But the actor is a bad fit for the part. Johnson has spent his entire film career crafting the image of a likable, good-natured hunk who spouts witty one-liners. In this movie, he just growls and glowers, and the effect feels discordant. The film, grim and pretentious, makes a few feeble attempts at humor, but they fall flat. Maybe Johnson can lighten up in the next installment, because of course there will be a sequel.  Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Oct 28, 2022",neutral," Pocas cosas me gustan más en esta vida —y es triste que haya gente que lo diga con la boca pequeña— que entrar en el cine con la pantalla más grande y el sistema de sonido más ruidoso posible para entregarme a los incontables placeres que sólo puede ofrecer un blockbuster cargado de acción, one-liners y efectos visuales que me permita desconectar el cerebro durante un par de horas y disfrutar sin mayores complicaciones. Por supuesto, muchos productos de este corte pueden flaquear en un buen número de aspectos —principalmente en los que atañen a profundidades discursivas y narrativas—, pero estos males pueden ser mitigados y fácilmente perdonados de estar el resto a la altura; siendo el único pecado capital la generación de indiferencia y la falta de estímulos. Sentarte en la butaca y abandonarla tras la proyección sin que se haya alterado tu estado emocional en un sólo instante. Este es, precisamente, el efecto que ha tenido 'Black Adam' sobre mi cada vez más quisquilloso cerebro. Y es que esta enésima película de orígenes superheróicos —o más bien antiheróicos— no sólo repite los aparentemente insalvables errores de las cintas homólogas que la han precedido, sino que parece estar edificada sobre un pastiche sin personalidad que transforma su visionado en un déjà-vu que salva in extremis la encomiable entrega de un Dwayne Johnson volcado en su ansiado proyecto. Dicen que, en incontables ocasiones, las primeras impresiones y las tomas de contacto son las que marcan verdaderamente la diferencia, y en el caso de 'Black Adam', arrancar su abultado metraje de 125 minutos con la enésima —y eterna— secuencia de montaje con voz en off aportando trasfondo a la historia, invita a abordar el resto del filme con una predisposición inmensa a la pereza que no se disipa una vez arranca el tardío segundo acto. El largometraje de Jaume Collet-Serra encuentra en la repetición su leitmotiv, construyendo su narrativa y estructura en torno a la réplica de fórmulas vistas una y mil veces. Una vez más, las tremendamente previsibles enemistades que se tornan alianzas forzadas frente a un enemigo común están a la orden del día, haciendo patente una rutina que se rompe eventualmente con alguna decisión interesante a la hora de dosificar y presentar ciertas informaciones al respetable. Esto no impide que 'Black Adam' funcione como una suerte de refrito de ideas en el que nombres y licencias son lo único que lo diferencian de las obras de la competencia. Esto incluye a unos personajes descafeinados y  moldeados a base de clichés que merman drásticamente la implicación emocional y cuyo batiburrillo de personalidades refleja un tono tremendamente inconsistente que transita entre lo severo, la comedia bufonesca, la épica solemne y una ligereza que termina predominando. En lo que respecta a la forma, el genio habitual de Collet-Serra queda, para sorpresa de nadie, diluido entre la maquinaria del blockbuster de gran estudio, entre la acción inerte y carente de alma —aunque con un acabado general más que decente—, y entre un surtido de intérpretes sencillamente funcional en el que, para sorpresa de nadie, destaca un Pierce Brosnan impoluto como el Dr. Fate. Es, en última instancia, el gigantesco carisma de Dwayne Johnson lo que salva la papeleta en una superproducción solvente —sin más—, carente de riesgo, y que ayuda a echar de menos a un Zack Snyder que, con sus filias y sus fobias, sabía impregnar sus adaptaciones comiqueras con una personalidad que parece no tener cabida en el subgénero más taquillero de los últimos tiempos."

There must be some cranky financiers in Hollywood this week now that the latest DC superhero movie Black Adam has been released upon the world and its audience finds it overdone, overblown, and too, too much.  I really wanted to like this film because there is so much about it that is so likeable, starting of course with its star and producer Dwayne Johnson, the personification of charm itself.  The cast also has the James Bond from my favourite Bond film, the Netflix star that blew up the internet over COVID, and as the internet spoiled over the weekend, Superman.  All of those things should make for a super-fun cinema experience, except that what Black Adam is missing is an editorial eye, that trick Coco Chanel tried to teach us all to do by looking in the mirror before we leave the house.  Suffering from the inability to say no, director Jaume Collet-Serra presides over an excess of ... everything. Too many superheroes, too much plot, an abundance of fighting, of CGI, and in some of his famous cast, an abundance of scenery-chewing.  In the Middle Eastern (fictional) country of Kahndaq, oppressor has replaced oppressor over the centuries, and the current occupier is multinational conglomerate Intergang whose mercenary troops are about to stumble into a piece of the nation's mystical history.  Five thousand years earlier, an oppressive king was defied by a demi-god whose powers were bestowed upon him by the same mystical wizards fans of the film Shazam! will be familiar with.  Archaeologist and historian Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) breaks into an ancient site to rescue a magically-imbued crown before Intergang get their mitts on it, but in the process she also awakens that ancient demi-god Teth Adam (Dwayne Johnson), who lays waste to the Intergang's mercenary army.  While Teth Adam might be a mythological hero to the people of Kahndaq, he is seen as a villain to the cadre of superheroes that arrive to contain him.  These include a girl who can control the wind (Quintessa Swindell as Maxine Hunkel/Cyclone), a young man who can grow to sky-scraper size (Noah Centineo as Al Rothstein/Atom Smasher), a magical psychic (Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate) and their leader (Aldis Hodge as Carter Hall/Hawkman).  This posse might live in the shadow of their more recognisable pals Batman, Aquaman and company, but they've got a job to do potentially saving the world from Adam. Initially a villain in the Shazam! comic books, Black Adam is an anti-hero, and like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, one we want to root for, although the darker side of his nature means there are real consequences to the violence he enacts.  However, putting the gore on display is a part of understanding this character's moral ambiguity, and for this reason, Black Adam is a little more violent that your average superhero film.   Johnson carries the film with his physical presence, but we all love him for his humour and that's not really a part of this character (yet - let's wait for the inevitable sequel).  If not for that, the many long fight scenes might wear on your patience, and the underwhelming character development given the other cast members might, well, underwhelm. "
"Oct 28, 2022",positive,A straightforward action. It starts and it doesn't stop. 
"Oct 27, 2022",positive,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Black Adam is perfect casting."
"Oct 27, 2022",negative," It's been a long time coming and a passion project of The Rock, now the DC Universe (DCU) has thrown a tonne of money into the CGI budget to bring this world to the big screen. Not to be confused with the Justice League but confusing anyway, here we have the Justice Society, led by the man formally known as Bond and his band of supes sent to smack down the unsmackdownable - The Rock. Weirdly, they're not the enemy. Or are they? And if they are, why? And if not, who is? And thanks to a hot mess of a story we are left with the even bigger question - who cares? The Rock does all the heavy lifting here and while he fills out the super-suit just fine, somehow the script demanded he leave his trademark charm and charisma in his trailer. Big mistake. I quickly lost the will to keep track of this convoluted plot, only to fail even more miserably in my mission to connect with or care about one single character in this disappointingly messy low-hanging fruit of a blockbuster."
"Oct 27, 2022",negative," 
Black Adam has been a long time coming. An idea for a Shazam! movie featuring DC's shadowy Superman was tossed around throughout the 2000s, with Dwayne Johnson expressing interest in both roles but ultimately gaining widespread fan approval for the popular DC villain. That project ultimately turned into 2019’s Shazam!, and Johnson stepped up as the producer and star for a Black Adam solo movie that has revealed itself as a full-blown passion project. Over the course of the press tour, Johnson has seemed keen to bill himself as a new major face of the infamously inconsistent DC Extended Universe, his hilarious go-to promo line being: “The hierarchy of power in the DC Universe is about to change.” After all this time, is it possible for Black Adam to truly be the film that convinces audiences of this being a viable cinematic universe?
 
This absolute clunker of an introduction to the Egyptian antihero is basically a Frankensteined assemblage of dusty bits from other movies you’ve seen before, with any of the idiosyncrasies smoothed out into a gray blob of brand extension. It’s a film that reeks of studio notes and focus-grouping, so much so I’m inclined to believe Johnson ghost-directed the thing – a movie so devoid of personality certainly syncs up with his acting style.
 
If there’s something nice to say about Black Adam, it’s that the character gets to kill bad guys with some occasionally admirable brutality. This is mostly incidental seeing as it’s inherent to his antihero status, but I did wake up a bit watching a guy disintegrate into a skeleton, another guy getting his arm torn off, and another guy getting ripped in half altogether. I also commend that the story is largely centralized on the conflict of Kahndaq, rather than becoming explicitly another save-the-world superhero movie.

"Oct 27, 2022",positive," Black Adam should receive an award for its dazzling, iron-fisted impatience. A Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson vehicle since the DC Extended Universe was but a twinkle in Warner Brothers’ eye and since Shazam was still known as Captain Marvel, it’s a superhero film almost 20 years in the making. But what should be a prestige cornerstone of a big screen franchise, touted by The Rock himself to “change the hierarchy of power of the DC Universe,” is instead a frenetic beat ‘em up barreling its way through fleet superheroics and murderous melees. What’s most surprising, though, is that goofy, unpretentious crowd-pleaser mode isn’t exactly a bad look for Black Adam.  Directed by genre journeyman Jaume Collet-Serra (Jungle Cruise, House of Wax), whose penchant for briskly-paced thrillers has single-handedly propped up Liam Neeson’s late-career transformation into an action hero, Black Adam rockets out of the gate to dispense with exposition at lightning speed. Flashbacks color in the history of the North African kingdom of Kahndaq, which 5,000 years ago was home to a ruthless tyrant monarch and the slave - Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) - who dared to defy him. Imbued with godlike power from the wizard Shazam (last seen in David F. Sandberg’s Shazam!), Adam violently liberated his city and became a legend, eventually becoming a symbol of hope for modern-day Kahndaq, now fallen to foreign occupation from the globe-spanning criminal element known as Intergang.  Collet-Serra is wholly uninterested in world-building, instead choosing to spend Black Adam’s opening salvo snapping pieces together with reckless abandon. Revolving its superheroics around archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) and a laughably stock game of hot potato for a powerful Macguffin - the Crown of Sabbac - Black Adam wastes no time accidentally awakening its titular hero to crack some skulls. Even its big superhero team-up, which introduces the very first big screen iteration of the Justice Society of America, is written in amusing shorthand; you’d be forgiven to believe that the movie versions of these heroes - Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate, Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, and Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone - have been around forever. It’s a crude and matter-of-fact setup that’s either refreshingly cavalier or frustratingly lazy, but the JSA vs. Teth-Adam showdown makes for a meaty center of an uneven superhero tale. There’s plenty of adrenaline-pumping joy to be found as Black Adam routinely toes the PG-13 border, reveling in the JSA’s humorously futile attempts to stop the bloodthirsty antihero from roasting, dismembering, and pulverizing Intergang goons. If anything, Black Adam finds its greatest strength in obliterating a line rarely crossed in superhero films: the justification - nay, endorsement - of violence in the face of oppression.  Dwayne Johnson is clearly having a ball stepping into Black Adam’s lightning-powered boots, but it’s a more subdued performance that’s clearly missing his typical spark of charisma. Stoic and gruff, Johnson’s Teth-Adam is a far cry from the imperious, arrogant demigod of the comics. And Black Adam also suffers from many of the same flaws that plague almost every modern superhero film: the visuals range from lush and beautiful to rushed and wonky, and while the final showdown is a cut above the standard big beam explosion fiesta - mostly on account of Adam’s brutality and some clever magical trickery - it still relies too much on its weightless CGI beatdown. But Black Adam buoys itself with a shocking self-awareness, never once pretending to be above its unapologetic, goofy, and deliriously violent yarn. Nimble and fleet in his contradiction of the mythologizing Marvel way, Jaume Collet-Serra just might have cracked the code on the disposable superhero crowd-pleaser, and with it, the future of the DC Universe."
"Oct 27, 2022",negative," Black Adam is the latest entry in the DC Extended Universe. With all the plentiful stories out there about God-like saviours and human heroics, it would have to take a strong, fresh, and original hook to stand out from the pack. In the case of Black Adam, the hook is that the titular hero flouts himself as no saviour, an anti-hero if you will. The marketing for this film has been, for a lack of better word, laughable. The titular role of a character that questions the fine line between heroism and vigilantism has been done to death and the touting, posing, and procrastinating about it is lunkheaded [sic]. And that’s where Dwayne Johnson fits in. It is hard to believe that it has taken this long for Johnson to play a superhero given the fact that it has taken fifteen years for the titular character to be filmed on screen. It is because of that long interval from greenlight to the final product that Johnson’s performance is likably nostalgic. It recalls his early acting career and is filled with fierce gazes, preening, and monotone line deliveries that would once again invite comparisons to him being the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. So far though, there is nothing fresh, original, or striking about Black Adam. Enter filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra, who specialises in directing mid-budget studio genre fare from horror schlock (Orphan, House of Wax) to throwaway thrillers with Liam Neeson (Non-Stop, Unknown), and, most recently, family adventures (Jungle Cruise with Dwayne Johnson). After examining his filmography, Collet-Serra has clearly never made an original film in his life. Consequently, it only makes Black Adam’s marketing and the final product funnier. The contrast provides constant, if unintentional, levity to proceedings. Enough beating around the bush, does the latest DC entry succeed on its own terms? To put it in one word, no. The storytelling is tedious and needlessly convoluted. The bouts of exposition are delivered poorly through droning narration that will lose most people completely due to constant jargon. There are moments of interest involving the contradictions of heroism and the follies of colonialism. However, these themes are swept under the proverbial rug when the action and superhero hijinks kick in. Does the film’s action redeem or pad out the storytelling? That would depend on how much cinematic noise one can handle. Collet-Serra has always had a visual eye that elevates his humble genre fare with palpable energy. However, his direction of the action scenes leaves much to be desired. The speed ramping and dollops of CGI become repetitive and tedious. The bombastic score by Lorne Balfe does lend some rousing force into it but it just ends up being in the bag of both visual and cinematic noise. Cinematic noise can be fun but there must be a beating heart from the people that make the noise. This is where the characterisations come in. The actors try their very best to imbue life into their characters in a way that matches the visual compositions. Unfortunately, the sparse script gives them little to do in terms of personality, humanity, and even levity. The intrepid pair of Noah Centineo (as Atom Smasher) and Quintessa Swindell (as Cyclone) barely show any spark while a pulse from Pierce Brosnan (as Dr. Fate) is scarce. Aldis Hodge is fun and imposing as Hawkman. The real downer here is Marwan Kenzari. He is a talented actor in films like Instinct (2019) and it is not his fault that his role in Black Adam is bereft of any qualities that would appear menacing. It just goes to show that a convincing motivation for a villain is not enough to make it memorable. Black Adam fails to be a memorable, cinematic action film. With haphazard storytelling, increasingly tedious and repetitive action scenes and forgettable characters, the latest DC entry lands with a heavy thud."
"Oct 26, 2022",positive," Jaume Collet-Serra’s Black Adam has all the makings of a special disaster, the kind of which you’d expect the Critical Dunk Contest backboards (covered with Twitter and Stella Artois sponsorship branding) and racks of helium-inflated balls to be rolled out for the participants in whatever empty arena would even have an event so few people would show up to and pay for. It’s a vanity project designed solely by the world’s last-remaining true-blue action draw that has been sitting on a shelf in development hell long enough that The Rock still had hair when he first announced his intentions to bring the character to the screen. Collet-Serra’s last project, Jungle Cruise, also with the former Rocky Maivia, was genuinely pretty miserable, and you could feel him chafing against the dimensions of the project as outlined by his cage keepers at Disney. Then there’s the creative and financial turmoil that both DC Comics and Warner Bros have endured over the last two or three years in plenty of self-inflicted ways – as a reminder, this is the last tentpole film you’ll see from the studio for the rest of this calendar year – with many pointing to the lack of a stable guiding hand wrist-deep within the DC Extended Universe’s sock puppet. You can see aspects of the film some were expecting within the final product itself: There’s plenty of failed banter and half-finished CGI strewn throughout (though, admittedly, it looks one thousand times better than anything in Thor: Love and Thunder), and the occasional turn towards a Cameron-style bonding between killing machine and charge is about as clumsily executed as you might expect. But Black Adam is surprisingly compelling, both as a reactionary statement against the state of superhero cinema with geopolitical ambitions and a fun expression of all of the things it’s railing against, and if I were a betting man, I genuinely probably would have lost a decent chunk of change on this one. Formerly known as Teth Adam, Rock’s lead was once a slave digging for rare and magical materials in the mines of the kingdom of Kahndaq some five thousand years ago. See, the king of this once-prosperous state wanted to make a crown from that miracle material in order to summon a hellish power – known as Sabbac, from beneath and cement his rule on Earth, but Adam stood up. At the moment before his execution, he was summoned away to the Rock of Eternity, where he was granted the powers of the Old Gods in the very same way that Zachary Levi was in our modern time, summoned up from the ether by the magic word “Shazam” and with its transformative power unleashed through lightning. Adam put a stop to the king’s ambitions and was subsequently sealed off in a kind of magical suspended animation, buried deep within the walls of the very prison they sealed the king’s enchanted crown within. Five thousand later, Kahndaq is a failed state, run by the mercenaries known as the Intergang, an international group of assholes dedicated to finding all of the remaining materials and, of course, the crown itself. There’s only some amount of opposition among the subjugated, who can’t compete with the high-tech devices of their invaders, coming in the form of an archeologist (Sarah Shahi), some of her family members, and her son (Bodhi Sabongui), all of whom are looking for the crown to prevent it from falling into the Intergang’s hands. When they find the crown and the tomb, they’re assaulted by the mercenaries, and in a Hail Mary play, she frees Black Adam from his suspended state. It’s at this point that he unleashes hell itself upon the soldiers, and draws the attention of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who realizes that this dude is one bad motherfucker. With all the other big-leaguers not wanting to waste a contractually-bound appearance for this little of a paycheck, she turns to the Justice Society, a group of off-brand superheroes used as a public-facing Suicide Squad who are keener to playing ball with the US Government than the boys in blue tights. They’re led by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), a winged warrior who is a kind-of alien Bruce Wayne, and the rest of their ranks – Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), who is basically a human tornado, Atom Smasher (Noah Centenio), a legacy superhero who can manipulate his size but not control insects, and Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan, having a good time), a sorcerer whose magic helmet gives him his powers, allows him to see the future, and actually speak with a British accent instead of the clipped faux-American of Benedict Cumberbatch – head to Kahndaq to make the world safe for democracy from this weapon of mass destruction. Needless to say, Adam’s not too happy about this, but he also doesn’t know if he fits in this world. His state is ruined, his enemies are threatening to reemerge (Intergang still wants that crown to summon Sabbac, after all), and he doesn’t know if he really wants to keep his power, given all of the pain and trouble it has caused him across the eons. He’s a man of the Hammurabi code in a world governed by Declarations of Human Rights and things, which means he’s more brutal than he has to be, without a single thought otherwise, and scares and injures those around him. But Kahndaq needs a hero, and as the tagline goes, they have Black Adam. At this point, it becomes clear enough that the film that has had the most impact on the direction of the DCEU’s future is James Wan’s Aquaman, which wisely positioned itself as a combination of throwback camp evocative of the days of Krull, the modern styling of blockbuster cinema, and a reasonable amount of straight-up metal imagery tossed in to boot. Shazam owed a great deal to what it had established, even if their productions were concurrent, and Black Adam continues the trend. If Marvel’s films now feel like one’s sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner table with an overly-excited teen nephew trying to explain to you why the Fortnite mythos or whatever is actually cool and meaningful and worth the effort to engage with even though you are a grown-ass man with a job and cats to feed, DC seems to be aiming for the kind of doe-eyed enthusiasm that same kid had about whatever subject he was obsessed with just eight or so years earlier. There’s a large difference – that kid only cares that you’re going to take him to see the movie and doesn’t particularly care whether or not you’re going to enjoy it (though he will demand that you nod your head when he shouts about his favorite moments) – and Black Adam does a solid job of finding that niche. It is so wholly goofy and colorful – the broad colors of the Justice Society’s outfits and powers, the fact that the bad guy’s final form is essentially Tim Curry’s Satan from Legend or the massive amounts of chaos that Adam wrecks in the course of his ass-kicking – that it naturally sheds the pretentiousness of continuity. This is, after all, a movie where, within the first ten minutes, the Rock electrocutes a dude to the point that the skin and muscle sloughs off of his bones, to say nothing of the absolute ridiculousness that comprises the film’s final half hour. What’s even more remarkable is the way Collet-Serra goes out of his way to preserve elements of the DCEU style that were once pilloried for their very presence – namely, the influence of Zack Snyder on the action photography and aspects of the thematic inner workings of Black Adam. With regards to the former, many of the film’s best action sequences preserve Snyder’s portrayal of the mythic intensity of superpowers and often evoke the best elements of his in-universe work without coming across as anything other than loving tribute. There’s a lot of fun slow-mo stuff here that is patently ridiculous, much like all of the (Academy Award-winning, however dubious that may be) Flash bits in his Justice League opus, though it substitutes the aforementioned Wan-style campiness for some of Snyder’s portentous gravitas (which, to be perfectly fair, works wonderfully in the emotional context of that particular moment in that film). The way Johnson hovers, motionless aside from the space moving around him, with his huge traps giving him a weighted hunch, creates a fascinating feeling of power even when he’s not shoving grenades in soldiers’ mouths or throwing Hawkman into buildings across the way. But the skepticism of superheroics also feels distinctly Snyderian: Adam is not all he’s cracked up to be, as revealed in a mid-film twist, and the Justice Society themselves are mere pawns in an imperialist scheme. There’s an outright element of fascist imagery here, which is endemic to much superhero media, but in Collet-Serra’s rendering, it becomes something far more interesting, as muddled as it might be. Much of Black Adam is in direct conversation with other superhero cinema, in a way that DC and Warner Bros have often specifically gone out of their way to try and avoid, aside from one or two characters in James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, which similarly skewered the kind of gung-ho adventures of government-backed c-list superheroes being given the dirty work that the State would refuse to touch with obvious Hard Power. But Adam himself is a better analog for Captain America – down to imagery from the first film in that series being lifted and recontextualized by Collet-Serra at key moments – than Gunn’s Peacemaker ever was, given that he is the representation of the soul of his nation, past glory reflected through the lens of the present to offer a path forward in troubled times. On the other hand, it’s a full-throated refutation of the utopian ideals of Black Panther, where the precious resources of a fictional country led to their wholesale isolation and subsequent prosperity as opposed to their ruin by colonial powers. The inherent contradictions in large corporations trying to make this kind of agitprop are, of course, present. Still, it’s far more interesting to see ideas of self-determination and liberation – from one’s past, from one’s present – than it is to see the importance of tradition maintained, all the way down to blood combat for leadership. While Ryan Coogler’s movie is an intended fantasy of an imagined present and is successful as such, Collet-Serra has his eyes set to a kind of future, where the founding patriarchs of a failed and exploited state war and then rend the foundations that led to their subjugation. Is it the same kind of muck and muddle that we often find ourselves in within the boundaries of the genre? Absolutely. The coherence of the thesis only really sticks together while one’s watching the film unfold, though its ultimate prescription for the ills of this fictional country is still vaguely fascinating and quite endearing. But as critique, firmly entrenched within the language of big-budget superhero cinema rather than pushed into niche-genre coding like Gunn’s, it’s undoubtedly provocative in a very real way, emphasizing the consequences of imperialism, both state and corporate, and a kind of need for individual stability and safety – which can only come from within – before a nation can fully join the ranks of international society as a full and equal peer (though, of course, without the guiding hand to enable that stability, as literalized through the metaphor of Adam, that same international society will do whatever it possibly can to prevent that from happening in resource-rich nations). Given that the superhero boom truly kicked off with two War on Terror-era works that established a kind of relevancy for a genre otherwise stylistically estranged from all geopolitical realism, it’s a hell of a thing that we’ve some fourteen years down the line and finally have a full-throated rebuke of the sort of post-9/11 Middle Eastern adventure that the escapist trappings of Iron Man helped to found the MCU on. For all of Black Adam’s messiness, the fact that it can sell this to a primarily American audience and do so in an entertaining-enough fashion is extraordinary to witness."
"Oct 26, 2022",neutral," Dwayne Johnson (La Roca, para los amigos) ha estado desarrollando una película de “Black Adam” por prácticamente quince años —de hecho, el casting del personaje fue anunciado el 2007, cuando yo todavía estaba en el colegio (¡!). No debe sorprender, entonces, que el producto final se sienta, efectivamente, como algo que fue escrito mucho antes de que Zack Snyder trajera al Hombre de Acero a la pantalla grande, o de que el Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel comenzara con Iron Man. No es que “Black Adam” sea una película terrible, entonces —si no más bien que se siente innecesariamente anticuada. Lo cual es curioso, considerando que se trata de un filme lleno de acción, efectos visuales, y destrucción. Pero es en la estructura de la historia y en el desarrollo de los personajes, que la película se siente como un producto de otra época. El humor, por ejemplo, casi nunca funciona, y más bien resulta en momentos incómodos, en los que prácticamente nadie en mi sala de cine se reía. Y la inclusión de la Sociedad de la Justicia no es del todo exitosa —personajes como el Doctor Fate del gran Pierce Brosnan, o el Hawkman de Aldis Hodge ciertamente resaltan, pero la Cyclone de Quintessa Swindell o el Atom Smasher de Noah Centineo, desgraciadamente, no tienen mucho qué hacer. Y aunque el español Jaume Collet-Serra no es mal director, parece que su estilo no combina muy bien que digamos con lo que Johnson quería hacer acá. Lo cual es una pena, porque como muy bien se sabe, “Black Adam” es un proyecto de pasión para Johnson. Se trata de un personaje al que siempre ha querido interpretar, y de una historia que ha querido traer a la pantalla grande desde hace… bueno, quince años, como ya saben. Pero parece que el haber tenido el proyecto en el horno por tanto tiempo no ha hecho más que quemar la película, en vez de dejarla bien cocida. Ya hemos visto personajes similares a estos en otras (y mejores) películas. Ya hemos visto secuencias de acción como estas (y de manera más espectacular). Y hasta ya hemos tenido un filme de “¡Shazam!”, en donde los poderes de Adam son presentados de manera más vistosa y divertida. Johnson interpreta al personaje del título, un hombre que vivió hace más de cinco mil años en el país ficticio de Kahndaq, en el medio oriente. Un prólogo terriblemente narrado nos explica que Adam era el héroe de Kahndaq, pero que fue encerrado luego de una serie de traumáticos eventos (lo cuales son expandidos durante el tercer acto, en un flashback). Ya en el presente, la investigadora Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) y su equipo visitan un templo en busca de una legendaria corona, pero son atacados por los solados de Intergang (heh), una fuerza invasora en Kahndaq. Intentando defenderse, Adrianna termina por despertar/liberar a Adam, quien procede a eliminar de formas muy grotescas a sus enemigos. Pero no se preocupen. Se supone que Adam es una suerte de antihéroe, o que al menos debería contar con un arco de personaje en el que pase de ser villano a ser héroe… pero eso nunca queda del todo claro. Siempre consciente de su imagen como estrella de cine, el Black Adam de Dwayne Johnson nunca llega a comportarse como una persona horrible, por más de que repita hasta el cansancio que no es un héroe. De hecho, no se demora en hacerse amigo del hijo de Adrianna, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), quien le enseña frases lapidarias, y quien es rescatado repetidamente por este ser superpoderoso. Lo que podría haber sido desarrollado como una relación similar a la del T800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) y John Connor (Edward Furlong) en “Terminator 2”, pues, es interrumpido por una trama que necesita incluir peleas y explosiones y ruidos fuertes cada cinco minutos. Porque “Black Adam” es una película caótica, ruidosa. El primer acto se mueve de manera increíblemente acelerada, lanzándonos explicaciones y narraciones y diálogos torpes a toda velocidad, asegurándose de que nadie en el público se pueda perder o pueda dejar de entender ciertos detalles narrativos. Y cuando por fin parece que va a moverse a mejor ritmo, nos presenta a varios personajes secundarios —entre ellos a la ya mencionada Sociedad de la Justicia—, que prácticamente terminan por opacar a Adam y a Amon, haciendo que el filme se sienta más como la historia de un equipo de superhéroes, que como el origen del personaje del título. Curioso, considerando que se trata del bebé de Dwayne Johnson. Las actuaciones son, en su mayoría, bastante buenas. No obstante, quien destaca menos, curiosamente, es Johnson. El increíble carisma por el que se ha hecho tan famoso brilla por su ausencia, y el ex-luchador la reemplaza por diálogos repetitivos y expresiones monótonas. Adam no es el personaje más interesante de DC que hayamos visto en la pantalla grande, de eso no hay duda —alguien debió decirle a Johnson que “seriedad” no es lo mismo que “aburrimiento”. Felizmente, Pierce Brosnan logra robarse la película, inyectándole energía, clase y sí, carisma, a su Doctor Fate (y sí, sé que Fate apareció en los cómics antes que Doctor Strange, así que no comenzaré a hacer comparaciones). El Hawkman de Aldis Hodge también convence (por más de que actúe de manera increíblemente estúpida la mayor parte del tiempo). Y aunque, nuevamente, Noah Centineo y Quintessa Swindell tienen poco que hacer, al menos participan en una que otra escena de acción vistosa y visualmente atractiva. Disfruté particularmente de los poderes de Cyclone, quien muchas veces aparece en cámara lenta, girando, creando colores fuertes y causando un poco de destrucción y confusión. Atom Smasher, lamentablemente, no corre la misma suerte (solo diré que hemos visto usos más imaginativos de sus poderes de crecimiento en otras —y mejores— películas de acción en vivo). “Black Adam” no es un desastre absoluto. No me aburrí al verla, y disfruté de las actuaciones de Sarah Shahi, Pierce Brosnan y Aldis Hodge. Pero curiosamente, quien destaca menos es Dwayne Johnson, quien al interpretar al personaje del título, se siente curiosamente limitado, apagado. Súmenle a eso unas secuencias de acción caóticas y abrumadoras, algunos efectos visuales poco creíbles, y una narrativa absolutamente previsible, y “Black Adam” se torna rápidamente en una experiencia que cumple con lo mínimo que se esperaría de una película de superhéroes en el 2022… y nada más. Considerando lo mucho que se ha hecho con el subgénero en los últimos años, tiene sentido que se tengan ciertas expectativas hacia este tipo de películas, y desgraciadamente, “Black Adam” no cumple con muchas de ellas.

"Oct 26, 2022",positive," Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra
Starring Dwayne Johnson, Sarah Shahi, Viola Davis, Aldis Hodge, Pierce Brosnan, Noah Centineo,  James Cusati-Moyer, Quintessa Swindell, Marwan Kenzari and Mohammed Amir. In ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly 5,000 years have passed, and Black Adam has gone from man to myth to legend. Now free, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone. Some of this cinematic universe’s strongest elements can be found in the origin movies; the first two-thirds of Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, and Shazam!, a film with which this is intrinsically linked, so-much-so that they were originally planning to debut the characters in a single film. It’s a good thing that they didn’t, because Black Adam is as crowded as Dwayne Johnson’s suit is with muscles, especially for those uninitiated with things such as the The Justice Society of America.  Their introduction are just one of the many moving parts at play in Black Adam, with the titular character’s origin story hastily covered in the opening salvo, we then have to meet Sarah Shahi’s underdeveloped freedom-fighter and her streetwise son, one of the most obvious “it’s him” bad-guys in a long while, as well as Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Pierce Brosnan’s Dr. Fate, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, and Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone. Returning as the nefarious Amanda Waller, a Viola Davis voiceover helps to fill in some of the blanks on their bios, but all credit must go to the actors bringing them to life, because they could have suffered the same superhero fate as some of the characters thrown at the screen in the latter X-Men movies and simply been lost amongst the chaos.  As it is they all get their moment in the CGI sun, with helmet’s off to Brosnan and Hodge in particular, who strike up quite the double-act as they fly around in their Jeff Bezos style spaceship. Centineo and Swindell also bring a level of charm to their heroes that would make their a return a welcome one should this prove to the box-office hit Warner Bros., DC and Johnson are hoping for.  For many the fate of Black Adam rests squarely on the huge shoulders of The Rock, who’s kind-of playing against type here, reigning in a lot of the quips and keeping the eyebrow in check. He’s the reason those not au-fait with the IP will show up to Black Adam, which a superb mid-credits sting aside, doesn’t feel that integral to your understanding of this world moving forward. His Teth-Adam is a performance of relative restraint, with the film sensibly eschewing a lot of the fish-out–of-water comedy that made something like Kenneth Branagh’s Thor a tonal success, instead it presents the character as a totem of the dichotomy between good and evil, something the DCEU has wrestled successfully with since its inception. As with all of the characters, their trajectories are quite predictable, and you wish the film allowed them more time to breathe, simply so we could give a shit about who is being tossed around those beautiful orange-hued skies.  Imbuing the on-screen action with a superhero performance of its own is Lorne Balfe’s terrific score. His ‘Black Adam Theme’ is already dislodging Harry Styles from the top of the Spotify playlist. A rousing piece of modern music built upon the kind of traditional sounds you’d expect to hear from the films non-specific fictional nation of Kahndaq.  On which, the film perhaps ambitiously attempts some level of social commentary about occupied nations or the situation in the Middle-East, but a lot like everything else in the convoluted script it gets smothered in Jaume Collet-Serra’s blockbuster action, which admittedly has impressive levels of clarity in a world that has so often been shrouded in murkiness.  Cut from the same cloth, or ripped from the same pages to that which has come before, most notably the Snyderverse, Black Adam is two hours of flying and punching that grounds its likeable cast just long enough for it to be decent blockbuster fun. "
"Oct 26, 2022",positive,"While DC explores a darker, over-serious side of the comic-book superhero genre, at least that adds an original tone to this action-packed apocalyptic romp."
"Oct 26, 2022",positive," Introducing DC Comics’ latest crime combatant, Black Adam. His superhero traits are similar to Superman’s (flying, ultra-strength, etc.), but there are key differences. One has a pleasant personality and values human lives, and the other, an angry malcontent, doesn’t give a flying leap. One was born on Krypton and grew up on earth, which many moviegoers already know. However, less is known about the enigmatic bad boy. Hence this origin film, which needs to establish Black Adam’s beginnings, why he’s so embittered and how he fits into the world, or at least the DC universe.  Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has shepherded this project, his lovechild, for decades. Bringing the story of DC’s brown-skinned superhero to fruition is a major achievement and the movie star has earned his props—even if this act/fan/sci-fi is less than perfect. He was born to play Black Adam, every role in his past builds up to this persona and it’s a crown he was destined to wear. Screenwriters Adam Sztykiel (Rampage), Rory Haines (The Mauritanian) and Sohrab Noshirvani (Informer) don’t have a successful superhero movie in their spotty filmographies. Yet, they were tasked with developing characters, storylines, dialogue and major plot points for a comic book anti-hero who was conceived back in 1945 and swathed in Middle Eastern culture. Former music video and commercial director turned filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra, who worked with Johnson on Jungle Cruise (a dubious achievement at best), helms this venture, which might explain the emphasis on movement and flow and less weight on mind-blowing special effects. The ancient city and now bustling metropolis of Kahndaq lives under tyranny. It’s citizens long for their freedom. Through a mishap in an ancient tomb, archeologist Adrianna (Sarah Shahi, The Rookie) unleashes Teth Adam (Johnson), a powerful being who’d been imprisoned for 5000 years. Angry and looking for vengeance against millenniums-old adversaries, he is on a tear: “I was a slave before I died. I yield to no one.” The Justice Society (the very first superhero team, which was created back in DC Comics in 1940), a squad of modern-day heroes, is determined to catch and detain the angry rebel.  The JS is directed by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who zooms in her commands remotely to the team:  Hawkman (Aldis Hodge, One Night in Miami…), Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan, Goldeneye), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell). Teth Adam, aka Black Adam, will not go quietly. Neither will the enemies of the Kahndaq people. The fight scenes are filmed decently (cinematographer Lawrence Sher, Joker) and the film’s depiction of early life in Kahndaq has been shot in an evocative hue. City exteriors and interiors (Tom Meyer, Finch) conjure the Middle East/North African region, everyday clothes from olden and modern times (Kurtland Bart, Deadpool 2) reflect the locals’ lives and the crusaders’s costumes are just lavish enough. Loud music piques feelings (Lorne Balfe, Black Widow) and credit editors Mike Sale and John Lee for giving the footage momentum that rarely wanes.  Johnson, over his 21-year, up-and-down movie career, has built a prolific actioner resume. Looks like a wrestler, struts like a movie star and acts like he could give anyone a beat down. Here, he’s in his glory. The lighting on his face and physique deifies him. The skintight reptile-looking costume highlights his Mr. Olympia fit body. His glare could stop a locomotive. Johnson’s interpretation of an aggrieved superhero hits a peak, but the script, direction and special effects do not reach that level. This uneven, comic book adaptation is not in the same league as The Dark Night (visually stunning), Wonder Woman (fresh and surprising), Black Panther (a monumental breakthrough) or Deadpool (deeply depraved.) Yet it’s distinguished itself just enough to satiate action film fans, entertain future streaming audiences and warrant further merging into the DC universe. "
"Oct 26, 2022",negative," After a week off, Erik Childress and Steve Prokopy return to bring you their thoughts on the latest in theaters and on streaming and catch up on at least one film from the break. Another catch up is on their review of another great music doc that they recommended from SXSW this year (The Return of Tanya Tucker – Featuring Brandi Carlile). The horror anthology series returns (V/H/S/99) and Jessica Chastain has to stop Eddie Redmayne’s reign of hospital terror in a true-life tale (The Good Nurse). Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke are half-brothers reuniting to bury their terrible father (Raymond & Ray) and Harry Styles tries to ruin another woman’s life (My Policeman). Laurie Strode’s life could not possibly be more ruined except by appearing in one more film (Halloween Ends) and Julia Roberts tries to ruin another wedding, this time with George Clooney (Ticket To Paradise). Finally, DC gives it another go but Dwayne Johnson is no hero (Black Adam)."
"Oct 26, 2022",positive,"Why the vitriol for what it an entertaining comic book movie? It wasn’t perfect, the story is tangled, but it reminded me of those memories when the hero comes around in the last pages of my 25 cent comic in the 1970s. Audience 90 Critics 39. Nuff said."
"Oct 25, 2022",positive,"The world-building in the film brings in the justice society and some notable hero names, but its still a bit boiler-plate with the plot. And while I enjoyed Johnson's BA, the character feels like it was written for ego, not for growth."
"Oct 25, 2022",negative," Dizzying action, dazzling visual effects and Dwayne Johnson, supported by a cast of lively co-actors, lend Black Adam - the first feature devoted to the DC Comics anti-hero - pace and power. The film's dynamism is, however, strictly superficial. The long-gestating action adventure certainly isn't greater than the sum of its parts? The parts that work, especially Johnson's immense star power, do the heavy lifting. The genre tropes, wrapped and delivered in shimmering packets, do not quite pull their weight. The focus of Black Adam is expectedly on the titular character and the star who embodies him on screen - both undeniably mighty. The story takes a bit of a back seat in the process without being knocked completely out of the reckoning. The spin-off from 2019's Shazam wastes no time to jump into a prelude that spells out how Adam Teth, a hero, a champion, a legend, became Black Adam. The film gallops at a steady clip from there on. That makes the Black Adam markedly tauter than most superhero flicks. It never loses momentum. If anything, there are times in the film when one feels that it might have done well to slow down just a tad. It delivers information at breakneck speed, which tends to overpower the surface inducements of a well-mounted movie with its share of highs. The trimmed length - Black Adam, written by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani, is a compact, two-hour affair - is one of its biggest strengths. The non-stop flow of set pieces, while seeming pretty familiar, does not outlive its welcome. Dwayne Johnson, acutely aware that he is the prime draw and steps up to the plate with ease. However, try as hard as he may he is unable to paper over the superhero movie cliches that the character has to deal with as he fights his own wrath and the aggressive scepticism of the superheroes of the Justice Society deployed who confront him. The actors who play the JSA members, especially Aldis Hodge and Quintessa Swindell, have their moments. As do Sarah Shahi and Bodhi Sabongui, cast as a mother and son duo. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate, too, makes his presence felt. But Black Adam is Dwayne Johnson's film all the way. There is a nary moment that suggests otherwise. The struggle of a tormented but invincible protagonist who walks a thin line between heroism and villainy is the principal conflict point in a spectacular tentpole production that, while it serves up all that it is supposed to, manages to articulate an anti-imperialist stance, advocating the cause of colonised people who have been exploited and robbed over eons of their resources. But does Black Adam pave the way forward for a new DCEU franchise that seeks to deliver megahits in the years ahead? It looks and feels strong enough as a film that is meant to start a new era. The fate of the movies that lie in the near future will rest squarely on what Warner-DC can bring to the mix. That would have to be significantly more than what Black Adam delivers. Black Adam, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra in a manner that obviates any possibility of the superhero flick playbook being recast in a new mould, begins with an introductory flashback that takes the audience to 2600 BCE and the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq, once ""a centre of power and enlightenment"" that is now ruled by a brutal despot, King Ahn-Tok. The enslaved Kahndaqi population works in the mines to extract a magical mineral, eternium, from which the nation's ruler derives unimaginable powers. A slave boy rises from among them and stands up to the King. He slays the tyrant and becomes a demi-god to his people. Adam Teth is granted the gift of invincibility by the Council of Wizards. But because he, driven by uncontrollable rage, uses his godlike powers for the purpose of wreaking vengeance, he is banished from the land and imprisoned. The persona of Black Adam is born. The film jumps 5,000 years forward and, using the voiceover of a young present-day Kahndaqi boy, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), who believes a hero will arrive one day to liberate a people under foreign military occupation for 27 years, informs the audience that the misfortunes of the nation has never ceased. Amon's mother, Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), a resistance fighter and university professor with great knowledge of archaeological remnants, accidentally summons the long-dormant Black Adam. He proceeds to wipe out several armed men of the Intergang, the international mercenaries in control of the Kahndaq, as they try to close in on the Crown of Sabbac. Adrianna stands between the mercenaries and the prized artifact. The return of Black Adam provokes Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to send the Justice Society's Carter Hall/Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Kent Nelson/Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Albert Rothstein/Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Maxine Hunkel/Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) to Kahndaq to rein in the rampaging Adam. Once the quartet lands in Kahndaq, Black Adam moves into top gear and unleashes a veritable torrent of twists and turns. Troubles multiply for Adrianna and her son - the boy who wants his people to be saved finds himself in need of a rescue act when inimical forces kidnap him to force his mother's hand. The duo, with Adrianna's electrician-brother Karim (Mohammed Amir) chipping in at crucial junctures, seeks to prevent the Crown of Sabbac from falling into the wrong hands. Hawkman tries to stop Black Adam from continuing down the path of dispensing his brand of instant and destructive justice. A descendant of King Ahn-Tok surfaces to lay claim to the priceless crown that everybody wants. Caught between the two, Doctor Fate, who has the power to see what lies ahead, exhorts Hawkman to use the time that they have to change the future. Later, he appeals to Black Adam not to ""give up on us"" because the ""world needs you"". Will the audience be saying the same when they are done watching Black Adam? Black Adam is a whirlwind of a movie. One just goes along with it. It gives you no time to pause and wonder. That, in the dictionary of superhero movie fans, would mean that Black Adam and the lead actor who holds the film together have delivered their money's worth. The question is: would a little more have hurt anyone?"
"Oct 25, 2022",negative,Will there be more Black Adam movies? I don't know but it might be best to say Shazam and hope for the best.
"Oct 25, 2022",negative,A muddled mess of a movie.
"Oct 25, 2022",negative,"It raises big ideas. Honestly, it would have been a really cool movie if they had done anything with them. [...] Instead they just take the path of least resistance."
"Oct 25, 2022",negative," There is no soul or heart to this movie. Just fights, spouting rhetoric, and some hackneyed, convoluted backstory that requires constant exposition and rule-setting throughout the film. While there is a lot of hype around Dwayne Johnson’s leap into the world of superheroes, by his entering the DC Extended Universe through Black Adam, the hype is sadly just that. Hype. While Johnson fills out the role and looks the part, the movie is one of the most dispiriting and exhausting disappointments in recent memory. As Johnson has become the biggest movie star in the world, he has also typically played things safe cinematically. As one of the most charismatic professional wrestlers in history, creating “The Rock” persona and turning that into superstardom, one would think that some of that charisma would carry into his long-anticipated foray into the superhero film. You’d be wrong. Despite The Rock/Dwayne Johnson being universally loved and recognized, why is he in a movie so joyless? Why does Johnson utter his lines with a choked-off, stunted, gravelly monotone cadence? I know we can’t have “The People’s Eyebrow” and whatnot, but to quote another member of the DC Extended Universe, “Why so serious?!”If Johnson’s grunting vocalism isn’t a barrier to enjoying the film, then allow me to point to a convoluted 15-minute opening sequence which drowns viewers in encyclopedia-like levels of exposition. Should you survive that, then perhaps the film’s odd “dialogue,” consisting of people talking at one another and not directly to them, grows so wearisome you want to just surrender. Or tap out…like The Rock forced many an opponent to do in WWE, circa 1998, with his variation of a move called “the sharpshooter.” Point is: Black Adam quickly devolves into the worst film of the DC Extended Universe thus far. The film gets spun up in creating a staggeringly dense world and fails to make any of it matter. So…what even is this thing about? In a nutshell, Black Adam is a superhero/anti-hero origin story that introduces us to a 5,000-year-old Middle Eastern/Egyptian warrior named Teth-Adam (Johnson). Adam is brought into present day, when an archaeologist (Sarah Shahi) awakens him by uttering a chant while searching for a legendary crown. The Crown of Sabbac provides ultimate power to whoever wears it. We also learn of a mineral known as “Eternium,” which creates the power within the crown and can be weaponized against people.  While there is a lot of hype around Dwayne Johnson’s leap into the world of superheroes, by his entering the DC Extended Universe through Black Adam, the hype is sadly just that. Hype. While Johnson fills out the role and looks the part, the movie is one of the most dispiriting and exhausting disappointments in recent memory.  As Johnson has become the biggest movie star in the world, he has also typically played things safe cinematically. As one of the most charismatic professional wrestlers in history, creating “The Rock” persona and turning that into superstardom, one would think that some of that charisma would carry into his long-anticipated foray into the superhero film. You’d be wrong. Despite The Rock/Dwayne Johnson being universally loved and recognized, why is he in a movie so joyless? Why does Johnson utter his lines with a choked-off, stunted, gravelly monotone cadence? I know we can’t have “The People’s Eyebrow” and whatnot, but to quote another member of the DC Extended Universe, “Why so serious?!” If Johnson’s grunting vocalism isn’t a barrier to enjoying the film, then allow me to point to a convoluted 15-minute opening sequence which drowns viewers in encyclopedia-like levels of exposition. Should you survive that, then perhaps the film’s odd “dialogue,” consisting of people talking at one another and not directly to them, grows so wearisome you want to just surrender.  Point is: Black Adam quickly devolves into the worst film of the DC Extended Universe thus far. The film gets spun up in creating a staggeringly dense world and fails to make any of it matter.

She deploys the Justice Society of America (Editor’s Note: not the Justice League) to involve themselves in Teth-Adam’s resurrection. This adds a number of new superheroes into the mix, with zero character development outside of their superhero names tenuously relating to their superhero abilities. I should mention here…Teth-Adam was bestowed with the power of “Shazam” as a young boy. Shazam, as a superpower, gives people the ability to keep Earth in balance. Shazam is also a character in the DC Extended Universe, portrayed in superhero form by Zachary Levi, and in wizard form by Djimon Hounsou. As others have pointed out, why isn’t Levi’s character in the film? The superhero, literally named Shazam, is nowhere to be found. I mean, wouldn’t two people with Shazam power be better than one?! Was he on vacation?So what do we get in Black Adam? Lots of talking about stuff that feels like it is cribbing ideas from similar films and lots of fighting, And then some more fighting. And then even more fighting. Rhetoric is spouted. Johnson gargles out his lines. Since no one is ever actually having a conversation with anyone, people speak in the vicinity of one another. Three writers, as credited here, were apparently unable to find a way to humanize any of this. Except for the singular guy who burst into applause when the end credits appeared during my preview screening, no one watching around me appeared to react to much of any of this because there just isn’t any context for anything happening on screen. This new faction is loosely led by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge). Pierce Brosnan is here as Doctor Fate, a superhero archeologist struggling with hallucinations while clutching a magical gold helmet. Quintessa Swindell spins like a “Cyclone.” Then, a guy I referred to as “Not Deadpool” shows up with the name of Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo). I guess he can turn himself into a giant. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, whose resume includes films like Orphan, Jungle Cruise (starring Johnson), and not one, not two, not three, but four Liam Neeson action movies from the 2010s, I will concede that the visual effects work is rather impressive. Though that is a little like acknowledging that the perfectly staged house for sale in the neighborhood looks stunning, but then admitting that it only looks good because no one’s really living inside. That house - like this latest failure in the DC Extended Universe - is all façade. There’s no there there. And Black Adam is about as soulless, empty, and unnecessary a superhero movie as you will ever see.

"Oct 25, 2022",neutral," From the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes, Cultured Vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming. Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Black Adam looks more like a Zack Snyder film than any DC film not directed by Snyder himself. There’s a great emphasis on slow motion, the colors are wildly desaturated, and in the film’s first sequence there’s a thick grain over every image. Beyond the look, there’s the fact that the opening flashback (to 2600 BCE) feels extremely similar to the opening of Znyder’s 300 as voiceover offers a brief history lesson on the fictional nation of Kahndaq. It places the film firmly within the visual world of the DC Extended Universe that began with Man of Steel, and yet manages to tell a surprisingly standalone tale. All the more surprising because it’s so stuffed with characters. There’s a pretty immediate sense of “you’re either in or you’re out” with Black Adam’s narrative. The voiceover explanation of how wizards imbued a young hero with the power of the gods to fight an evil king seeking the power of demons is high level superhero stuff. And when Teth Adam (Dwayne Johnson), as the titular hero is known for most of the film, is reawakened in the present, the film wastes no time introducing us to four more supers who are sent to contain the possible threat Adam presents. It’s a comic book movie with broadly sketched comic book characters, who are brought into the story with quick three sentence or less bios. Hawkman, aka Carter Hall (Aldis Hodge), can fly and has a mace, Doctor Fate, aka Kent Nelson (Pierce Brosnan), can see the future and use magic, Atom Smasher, aka Al Rothstein (Noah Centineo), can grow to the size of a skyscraper, and Cyclone, aka Maxine Hunkel (Quintessa Swindell), can manipulate wind. Together they form the Justice Society, and remarkably, unlike previous DC films, these introductions don’t feel like advertisements for other movies or TV shows. These characters are here for this story and the movie clearly communicates what the audience needs to know before we can see them use their powers in action scenes. While we’ve seen superpowered characters smash into each other and use fire/lightning/magic/etc. energy attacks countless times at this point, Black Adam’s action scenes stand out. Cyclone’s genuinely visually novel (to the screen) power allows her to create, you guessed it, cyclones that offer a gorgeous mix of bright colors which pop against the otherwise chromey beige backdrop of the film. The major focus on slow-motion in these action scenes offer us genuinely epic images of these larger-than-life heroes in action. These near still images are essentially comic splash pages that allow us to simply drink in the splendor of the fantastical scenes in front of our eyes. That those fantastical scenes are in part in service of a story about the importance and necessity of revolutionary violence against oppressive forces only makes Black Adam more special in the current superhero movie landscape. The movie introduces Kahndaq as a nation that has been ruled and occupied by invading forces for millenia, evoking Palestine and Iraq with an early scene at a checkpoint. A moment where Adam points out that the Justice Society has never come to Kahndaq to help its people and is only here now to maintain “global stability” without any care for the occupied people is downright shocking in a major superhero movie in the best way. Black Adam is the rare movie whose component narrative parts work well, but don’t cohere into something as good as the sum of those parts. The way the movie moves between its many plots is, to be quite honest, clunky as hell. Several scenes show us the burgeoning attraction between Atom Smasher and Cyclone, and while the two young actors are charming and have chemistry, these scenes feel wholly unnecessary and out of place. The introduction of the Justice Society is done mostly smoothly, but the movie struggles to balance its three major conflicts, leading the final battle to arrive rather abruptly after a genuinely bewildering lull in the narrative momentum. There’s also some issues with the score, which mixes orchestral music and trap beats in an attempt to follow Ludwig Göransson’s Oscar-winning score for Black Panther but can’t quite seamlessly bring the two together, causing it to be awkwardly distracting. Also, while much of the humor in the film actually works, there’s an extended bit about the necessity for a catchphrase that becomes annoying by the film’s end. Black Adam is by no means a perfect movie, or even a perfect superhero movie, but it delivers exciting action scenes that feel unique in a blockbuster landscape littered with uninteresting superhero action scenes, and its serious consideration of the moral grays of revolutionary violence feel, well, revolutionary. And without spoiling anything, it’s the first film in nearly a decade that has included a mid-credits scene that feels like a promise and not a threat.

"Oct 25, 2022",negative," In development for nearly as long as its titular character lay dormant,  Black Adam has finally been unleashed on the world, for good or for ill. Dwayne Johnson plays Teth-Adam, a man from the ancient civilization of Kahndaq who is bestowed the powers of the very gods themselves by the mystical wizard Shazam and his magical cohorts who reside at the Rock of Eternity. Using these newfound powers, Adam becomes the champion of the enslaved people of Kahndaq and sets them free from their oppressive ruler in a climactic battle for the ages that foils the ruler’s evil plan to harness the power of untold horrors via a legendary malevolent crown known as the Crown of Sabbac. Both the crown and Adam go missing in the aftermath of this fight. At least that’s how the story of Teth-Adam’s myth goes. Modern Kahndaq, unfortunately, has seen its people return to subjugation under the eyes of the Intergang, an international criminal organization partaking in some modern day colonialism in the country. It is in this situation that university professor turned freedom fighter Adrianna, her brother Karim, and a pair of their close allies go into the desert in search for the Crown of Sabbac and Teth-Adam’s tomb. Intergang forces catch onto Adrianna’s group trying to pull off their best Indiana Jones impersonation and intercept them shortly after Adrianna manages to obtain the crown. The crown is conveniently in the same area as Teth-Adam’s final resting place, and in an act of desperation Adrianna recites the incantation carved on the cover of the tomb, unleashing Adam and all of his godly might on the Intergang soldiers. The awakening of Teth-Adam ends up drawing even more outside attention to Kahndaq as the superhero team the Justice Society of America, under orders from Viola Davis’ Amanda Waller, sends a small task comprised of Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Pierce Brosnan’s Doctor Fate, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, and Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone into the beleaguered country to subdue Teth-Adam. Unlike the story of a beloved champion repeated within Kahndaq, the Justice Society has intel related to the real story of Adam, and are acting under the guise of preemptive global protection. With a premise like that; one that tackles how perspective can affect how events and people are viewed, there was real potential for Black Adam to deliver some powerful messages. Unfortunately, the film’s multiman writing team doesn’t seem to be up to the task, whether due to too many cooks in the kitchen or meddling from those with more power than them. The resulting film is rather middling and by the numbers narratively speaking.  Black Adam is also a weird film in that while Teth-Adam is unquestionably the film’s main character, the film at times doesn’t feel like it is about him, and outside of a handful of flashback scenes isn’t even from his point of view. The film also overstays its welcome just a bit by tagging on a big smash fest finale after what seemed like a good stopping point. It is of course expected of the genre now that a superhero film needs to end on a big action scene, and that is good or even bearable in films with stellar or even just serviceable action scenes. Sadly Black Adam’s fight scenes just left me wanting more. Don’t get me wrong, on paper the idea of seeing Dwayne Johnson just going on a whole hog tear through nameless mooks is a concept I would very much like to see, but it is also a concept that one can easily overindulge in as well. Similarly, I actually went into the film looking forward to seeing Black Adam take on the Justice Society of America, particularly because I am a fan of both Hawkman and Doctor Fate. The prospect of Doctor Fate being properly let loose on the big screen in and of itself basically sold me on seeing this in a cinema. But these fights end up also having a similar rinse and repeat feel to them. The monotony of the action scenes could have been something I could brush aside if the acting made up for it. And for me personally, it just did not. Outside of Pierce Brosnan, who now in hindsight decided to put on an acting clinic when he really did not need to do such a thing, the acting in the film as at best “inoffensive”. Dwayne Johnson in particular puts in a rather muted performance compared to what people expect. The character of Teth-Adam is the kind of “anti-hero” who is basically an absolute dick to anyone who isn’t an explicit ally of his. I was genuinely hoping for something more from Johnson with his portrayal here as under his wrestling persona The Rock he has excelled at being the exact kind of personality needed for Teth-Adam. Instead he turns in a more serious effort that he just quite honestly doesn’t have the acting skills needed to make shine. I’ve gotten this far without mentioning Bodhi Sabongui’s Amon, Adrianna’s son, and for good reason. Amon, while not a bad character, is at times rather annoying, and at other times functionally a living plot device to move the story along. Visually the film is suffice to say a mixed bag as well. On one hand you have some really great effects utilized with Doctor Fate, and some, but not all, of the effects used when Adam uses his powers are, pardon the pun, electrifying. But then you get into some of the weirder visual choices. Multiple action scenes have some very questionably chosen slowed down or freeze frame shots. This for whatever reason regularly happens when Cyclone uses her powers, but it applies to nearly everyone.  I have also noticed that there has been some peculiar choices made in framing Dwayne Johnson’s face in many shots. I have already seen one of these shots spreading like wildfire online as a meme. And of course, there are just some downright bad CGI shots in this film. It isn’t often, but when they happen they are impossible to ignore. In the end Black Adam isn’t an outright bad film. There is clearly some potential at the heart of the film, and I genuinely think the film is worth at least one watch just for Doctor Fate alone. This film will undoubtedly have its fans, but for me it is ultimately more bland than anything else and among one of the weaker superhero outings of this year."
"Oct 25, 2022",negative," I’m sure the actor Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) will despise me after I write this review for his new film Black Adam, but I actually really enjoy him and his presence as a celebrity. I’ve followed him on instagram for years and have always found him to be charming and endearing as a public figure. So imagine my surprise when I saw his latest film from DC Films and Warner Brothers and all that charisma has been sucked out leaving a bland shell of the man I’ve enjoyed for years. Others seem to be enjoying this film more than I did, but I found it to be completely inert and lifeless, especially his character. It’s a real shame to because I actually love the whole cast. I’m a big fan of Sarah Shahi, and she’s given nothing interesting to do. I love Noah Centineo and think he is going to be a big star, but he’s barely-used comic relief,  and Pierce Brosnan can be wonderful but he feels like a warmed-over imitation of what Benedict Cumberbatch is doing in Doctor Strange. The only performance that stood out is Aldis Hodge as Hawkman. He is given some diversity of expression. Not just constantly stoic and bland like Black Adam. He can be light and engaging with Centineo’s Atom Smasher but he can also be serious, even tragic in other scenes. The villain is completely forgettable. I only saw it a few weeks ago and can remember little but a devil-like creature. They even have Black Adam off screen for a large portion at the end which is bizarre because that’s when e are supposed to be getting invested in his story. If I had never seen a comic book movie I guess I’d be impressed by some aspects of Black Adam but as far as developing characters in interesting ways and using its cast effectively it massively fails. If you like it than knock yourself out. Why do you care what I think?"

"Oct 25, 2022",neutral," Dejando de lado las menciones y apariciones en animaciones, es la primera vez que el personaje de Black Adam es llevado a la pantalla grande. Dicho superhéroe tuvo su primera aparición en 1945 en las historietas tituladas “The Marvel Family” / “Shazam Family”. Black Adam (2022) es planteada como un largometraje de origen del personaje, cuyo relato inicia más de dos mil años antes de Cristo, en una civilización antigua situada en Kahndaq, un desierto de oriente. En el prólogo se narra mediante una mezcla entre mitología e historia, la génesis de Teth-Adam, quien surge de la opresión de la esclavitud, con similitudes estéticas a la esclavitud del antiguo Egipto. Esta introducción es muy importante porque el espectador creerá que allí posee toda la información, pero una de las pocas sorpresas y aciertos del relato, es que se guarda una “carta bajo la manga” para el desenlace. A continuación, la acción continúa en Kahndaq, pero en la actualidad. Dicha ciudad ya no es un sitio de magnificencia y esplendor, sino un país del tercer mundo que se encuentra colonizado por un orden imperialista. Allí en una aventura, una arqueóloga, su hermano y su hijo, intentarán proteger un poderoso objeto arcaico de los mercenarios en cuestión. Para ello, desesperadamente, despertarán luego de milenios a Teth-Adam/Black Adam (interpretado por un casi inexpresivo Dwayne Johnson) apelando a su protección. Respecto al comic que retrataba a Black Adam como un antihéroe enceguecido por el poder, aquí éste es representado como un ser más ambiguo, y a pesar de su falta de piedad, actúa según lo que considera justo, y ya no por codicia. Lo cual quizás puede molestar a los fans de la historieta en donde al parecer el personaje era más oscuro. Aquí, Black Adam instintivamente sabe quiénes son los buenos y débiles convirtiéndose en su héroe defensor. De forma poco original, su argumento centra el conflicto en la posesión de una corona antigua, por parte del villano, Ishmael/Rey King Ahk-Ton. La idea de un elemento con poderes sobrenaturales que cae en las manos equivocadas, es algo ya bastante agotado en el cine de superhéroes, ya sea en DC Comics o su competencia Marvel Studios. Lamentablemente este no es el único recurso que denota la falta de creatividad en Black Adam, también lo demuestran la semejanza estética o temática con otro tipo de personajes preexistentes. Por ejemplo, el villano al lograr su transformación remite a una especie de Hellboy (2004) o Atom Smasher (superhéroe que tuvo su primera aparición en las historietas en 1983) a una versión más joven y más torpe de Ant-Man (2015/ comic 1962), y salvando las distancias un Dr. Fate (personaje que apareció en los comics en 1940) quien con su casco metálico en brazos nos recuerda visualmente a Magneto (personaje que apareció en los comics en 1963) de X-Men (2000) y Cyclone a Tormenta. Sin embargo, se debe resaltar positivamente la belleza estética de la composición de algunos encuadres que acertadamente remiten a los comics. El filme también exhibe, una tradicional presentación de los personajes del nuevo equipo que es configurado como una “resaca” de superhéroes, de menor categoría que los líderes tradicionales de La Liga de la Justicia, quienes al parecer deben acatar las esporádicas órdenes de Amanda Weller (Viola Davis). Pues la película no sólo posee conexiones con su predecesora Shazam (2019), sino también con los largometrajes de Escuadrón Suicida (Suicide Squad, 2016) y El escuadrón suicida (The Suicide Squad, 2021). En esta ocasión el equipo que dirige Weller es liderado por Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) y Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell). En dicho sentido, se conformarán tres estructuras: el villano Ishmael, el “antihéroe” Black Adam y el equipo de los cuatro superhéroes “tradicionales”. Entre estos dos últimos, se plantea una tesis social que divide la justicia por mano propia (ejercida por Black Adam) versus la diplomacia de un juicio político que desea consumar “La Sociedad de la Justicia”. Si bien la representación ambigua de Black Adam rompe con la tradicional dicotomía entre buenos y malos -aunque no llega a problematizarla-, nuevamente en esta propuesta de cinematográfica de DC, la psicología de los personajes carece de profundidad, a excepción de propuestas como Wonder Woman (2017) o algunas series televisivas, en contraposición a varias propuestas de Marvel. De igual modo, la reiteración y subrayado exacerbado de algunos recursos conjuntos como la cámara lenta y la música contemporánea en las escenas de acción del protagonista, resultan forzados, al igual que su humor poco efectivo. Asimismo, sus relaciones intertextuales hacia el spaghetti western de Sergio Leone, no tienen ningún propósito. En conclusión, Black Adam, a pesar de resultar en líneas generales pasatista, es bastante predecible puesto que constantemente se perciben sus artilugios narrativos. Por último, empero de algunos diálogos que enuncian la decepción frente a los superhéroes legitimados por los países del primer mundo, por ejemplo: “Superman, Batman y Wonder Woman no vienen a Kahndaq”, lo cierto es que lo que produce más emoción de esta entrega es la esperada escena sorpresa post-créditos, que anuncia la expansión y conexión del universo cinematográfico de DC Comics, mediante el regreso de uno de sus más acertados personajes, al servicio de los fans."

Larry Mantle and KPCC film critics Amy Nicholson, Andy Klein and Charles Solomon review this weekend’s new movie releases in theaters, streaming, and on demand platforms. The new film ‘Till’ tells the story of Mamie Till, as she brings her 14-year-old son Emmett Till home in a coffin, a victim of a horrific lynching, after a trip to Mississippi from Chicago to visit relatives. Different from other films on the subject, director Chinonye Chukwu makes a point to never show the lynching, but chooses to focus on the aftermath, particularly Mamie’s insistence on an open-casket funeral. Mamie wanted the world to see what white hate looked like, even allowing photographers to take pictures of her son’s battered face and body. This decision ultimately transformed her into a Civil Rights pioneer. Today on FilmWeek, KPCC’s John Horn sits down with the film’s director Chinonye Chukwu as well as the head of Orion Pictures, Alana Mayo, to discuss the process of bringing ‘Till’ to the screen."
"Oct 24, 2022",negative," There is no more discombobulated genre than the superhero genre right now. Marvel seems to strike as often as it hits these days, and the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is all over the map. While DC is sticking to its guns when it comes to tonally darker, more mature fare, the results are often mixed at best. That said, their recent spate has been surprisingly successful — James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad was damn entertaining and Matt Reeves’ The Batman was outstanding. Even the spin-off TV show Peacemaker was a hit.  Other than those … things get a little spottier. I’m not going to dive into the complicated morass of the “Snyderverse” films other than to say it has its share of ups and downs, but we can all agree that Wonder Woman 1984 was an unmitigated disaster, the upcoming Flash movie is mired in controversy, and Batgirl, sadly, will never see the light of day. Curiously, one of the more unexpected delights was Shazam, with Zachary Levi as its naïve, charming goofball of a hero.  It’s from the Shazam rogue’s gallery that we arrive with Black Adam, landing in theaters this week. Veering back into the darker tones, Black Adam stars Dwayne Johnson as a brooding, vengeful antihero, a millennia-old former slave imbued with godlike powers that are granted to him by a cabal of wizards who … you get the gist. There’s a lot of fantastical mumbo-jumbo and comic booky mysticism that works fairly well onscreen, even if I have a hard time writing it out. Regardless, Black Adam (going by his original name, Teth-Adam for most of the film) has been trapped in a magical prison in the fictional land of Kahndaq, a lawless place besieged by mercenary armies searching for the mythical Crown of Sabbac, a relic of — you guessed it — untold power. In the process of searching for it, Black Adam is awakened, only for the world to learn that he’s not the hero of legend we thought he was, and rather a rageful force of nature who kills without hesitation. It lays the framework for an interesting concept — what would we do about a “hero” who is seeking justice (in this case, freedom for Kahndaq), but who does so without remorse or ethics? What happens when someone with the power of Superman seeks justice but has none of the restraint? In this case, Black Adam’s efforts are opposed by The Justice Society, a loose collection of heroes who band together (thanks to an enjoyable familiar face) to stop his rampage. There are the makings of a great many thematic strengths here — the overpowered antihero, the concept of colonialist powers who abandon a country to ruin once its usefulness has run out, the cultural trampling disguised as savior syndrome that first world powers have when it comes to impoverished brown countries — all of those threads are there. But they get mired in the action and increasingly ridiculous plot, and the film suffers for it. None of those ideas are explored successfully beyond a few impassioned soliloquies, and it almost makes you wish they hadn’t even tried, rather than to try and fall so dreadfully short. This isn’t to say that Black Adam is entirely without merit. It’s oddly fun, even within its often brutalist framework and design. The action sequences are well-choreographed and the VFX are surprisingly effective, probably even better than much of the recent work we’ve seen from the MCU. There are some standout characters, too — the Justice Society features great work by Aldis Hodge as Carter Hall/Hawkman and Pierce Brosnan as Kent Nelson/Dr. Fate, along with their younger sidekicks — Noah Centino/Atom Smasher and Quintessa Swindell as Maxine Hunkel/Cyclone. They’re a fun combination and create a clever, bright dynamic when compared to the unrelenting grimness of Black Adam. That grimness is part of what drags the film down, too — there’s no denying that Johnson is brimming with charisma — it’s what overcomes any shortcomings he may have as an actor. But put him in a role where that charisma is largely absent, and you start running into trouble. Weirdly, that charisma does poke its head up periodically, particularly when he’s interacting with the Kahndaq revolutionary Adrianna (Sarah Shahi) and her superhero fanboy son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui). Yet at times the film feels like it’s overcompensating, becoming a parody of the John Carter/Terminator relationship of Terminator 2, with Amon trying to teach Black Adam catchphrases and modern culture.  What ultimately makes the film a hit-or-miss is what afflicts many DCEU properties — an inability to choose a tone. It feels like their films work best when they pick a lane and stay there — full-blown seriousness (The Batman) or unfettered zaniness (The Suicide Squad, Shazam). It’s when they try to blur the lines between the two that they struggle, and that’s clearly the issue here. I’m sure it didn’t help that Black Adam was held up by COVID. Its inconsistencies are also right there in its history — the script was originally written by comedic writer Adam Sztykiel (Made of Honor, Diary of a Wimpy Kid), then rewritten by Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani (who worked together on The Mauritanian and the British series Informer. Throw in director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan, The Shallows) and you’ve got an absolutely chaotic blending of ideas. Is Black Adam objectively bad? No, not really. It’s got some fun moments, and occasionally has the kind of Deadpool-esque violence that can be just as amusing as it is twisted. It’s a fairly hard PG-13 in the sense that its protagonist kills a LOT, but it’s also mostly bloodless, non-scary stuff (though apparently the first cut was almost given an R). Unfortunately, what heart there is in the film doesn’t come from its main character, and I don’t just mean that he’s not warm and fuzzy — this is the least entertaining, least appealing role of Johnson’s career. While that makes for great action, it also makes for an antihero that’s hard to get behind — not because he’s an antihero, but because it’s a poor, uninspired depiction of one, further dragged down by a script whose thematic reach far exceeds its grasp. It’s balanced out by great performances from the JSA cast (my son specifically said he wished they were more prominent in the film), but the film’s inconsistencies make it a messy, shallow, and likely polarizing experience."
"Oct 24, 2022",neutral," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters this weekend is Black Adam, the new DC superhero flick starring The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson and what a spectacle it is. For those that were fans of the comics, this one will bring joy to see characters like this and Hawkeye to the big screen, but, of course, just like anything in comic fandom, will also come with plenty of backlash because it doesn’t look or sound like the source material. That said, Johnson is a star and always a joy to watch on screen. But add in the talents of Aldis Hodge, Noah Centenio, Sarah Shahi, Pierce Brosnan, and Viola Davis along with sharp production and direction and you’ve got box office gold. Will that mean critics will love it? Absolutely not. But will you love it? If you love big popcorn movies and The Rock? You bet. Is it the best DC entry? No? Is is on par with the best of Marvel? No. But it’s quite loud, wild, fun, and for sure a crowd pleaser so take it for what it is and smell what The Rock is cooking. That’s it for this week and join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK and AMFM Magazine."
"Oct 24, 2022",positive," While the Marvel Cinematic Universe veers off in countless strange and indulgent directions, the DC Extended Universe sits suffering from a glaring identity crisis. What exactly is the DCEU? Who’s running the DC ship? Is there a roadmap? Which movies and what characters are a part of it? There was a time when I could answer those questions, but not these days. It’s all so convoluted and confusing, which is frustrating considering the iconic characters in their catalog. Zack Snyder had a well defined blueprint he was following. Unfortunately, his vision was “too dark”, “too gloomy”, and “too serious” for many who cut their teeth on the MCU. That, along with the Joss Whedon debacle and a considerable amount of studio meddling, insured that Snyder’s vision would never be fulfilled. So here we are, still wondering where they go from here. Sure, DC Films has put out some incredible movies (“The Batman”, “Joker”, etc.) that aren’t connected to their extended universe. But what about the DCEU? Enter Dwayne Johnson and “Black Adam”, a pairing that attempts to bring balance and (more importantly) direction to the DCEU. The engrossing superhero epic “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” aside, “Black Adam” is the first DCEU film since 2018’s “Aquaman” that genuinely feels a part of something bigger.  I’m not knocking smaller and more individual projects, but a sprawling universe needs interconnectivity and continuity. With “Black Adam”, it looks like the DCEU is finally ready to deliver that once again. One of the film’s biggest strengths was also one of its biggest question marks – Dwayne Johnson. The wrestler turned movie star brings loads of influence and notoriety to whatever film he’s in.  But he also has a truly larger-than-life personality which begs the question: would we be able to see beyond Dwayne Johnson to see Black Adam? The answer turns out to be a resounding “Yes”, and it’s in large part due to Johnson himself who gives a lights-out performance. He’s surprisingly restrained, intense and menacing, and slyly funny in some good moments of levity.  Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and written by the trio of Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, “Black Adam” quite intentionally avoids heavy exposition within its origin story framework. The most we get comes in a prologue where we’re taken back to 2600 BC. In the country of Kahndaq, a despot named Anh-Kot enslaves his own people, forcing them to mine for a mysterious metal called Eternium. The corrupt king wants the metal to forge the powerful Crown of Sabbac, but the people revolt. Legend says a champion named Teth-Adam was granted the power of Shazam which he used to kill Anh-Kot and free Kahndaq. In the present day, Kahndaq is oppressed by a high-tech organized crime syndicate called Intergang who are seeking the location of Crown of Sabbac. Knowing the dangers if Intergang gets its hand on the Crown, archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) tracks the artifact to a secret chamber deep in a mountain. It also happens to be the tomb of Teth-Adam. When she and her team are ambushed by a squad of Intergang soldiers, Adrianna recites an inscription that summons Teth-Adam himself (Johnson), an incredibly powerful being who immediately slaughters all of the Intergang soldiers. With Adam’s arrival, the people of Kahndaq believe they have finally found their champion. But his powerful presence is discovered by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), a ruthless government official who dispatches the Justice Society of America to apprehend him. With a team consisting of the Nth metal empowered Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), a master sorcerer Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), the wind controlling Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), who can grow enormous heights by manipulating his molecular structure, the JSA set out for Kahndaq. A big chunk of the movie operates within an interesting moral gray space as it wrestles with the questions: is Adam the hero longed for by the people of Kahndaq, or is he a dangerous villain who needs to be taken into custody? They’re questions that shape the very battles between the JSA and Adam as well as their inevitable team-up later on, once a more sinister threat arises. The movie offers no easy answers. Adam’s willingness to brutally kill his enemies clearly poses a problem for the JSA who are much more by-the-book. But where were the JSA and earth’s other heroes during Kahndaq’s centuries of oppression? This opens up some of the film’s deeper themes. And things only get more complicated as facts of Adam’s past come to light. All of that makes for the kind of compelling dynamic that superhero movies rarely engage these days. But make no mistake, this is a popcorn genre film through-and-through. “Black Adam” is the epitome of ‘action-packed’ with Collet-Serra putting together several terrific set pieces. Every character gets their moment to shine, with Hodge’s Hawkman and Brosnan’s Dr. Fate making intriguing new additions. But this is Black Adam’s show. Johnson energizes things with his magnetic antihero grit and gnarly kills which push the PG-13 rating, yet are still very much in tune with his character. In its noble effort to avoid the usual origin story trappings, “Black Adam” bypasses a lot of meaningful backstory, leaving us with a few too many questions. I was hungry to know about the Justice Society, and what is Waller’s connection to them? That said, “Black Adam” does a admirable job introducing new pieces and charting new courses for the DCEU, all within a mostly self-contained story. Obviously those quick to roll their eyes at franchise-building or DCEU movies in general will find plenty to nitpick. But “Black Adam” accomplishes everything it needs to. It offers big action and cracking new characters. It puts its own unique stamp on the superhero origin story. And it sets the DCEU on an exciting new trajectory. “Black Adam” is now showing in theaters. I liked it. I admittedly grade DC movies “on a curve” because they are…well…DC movies. It’s a big win for Dwayne and for them. I did think the character intros were a shade clumsy and could have been better done, but it features non-stop action thereafter, a little bit of humor, and a genuine interest in what comes next. Glad you enjoyed it, and I hope everyone gets out to see it in theatres if they can. Really glad to hear you enjoyed it too. I’m a bit frustrated at the thrashing it has received from fellow critics. It’s not without problems, but I think it’s far better than how it’s portrayed. It’s interesting to see how high the audience score is. Hardly a reliable measuring stick, but in this case I think it fits. Everyone I’ve talked to who has seen it enjoyed it. It almost sounds like some critics had their review ready and minds made up before they saw the movie. It kinda sounds like it. I don’t get it. I understand it not being for everyone, but this type of criticism of a movie that’s not nearly as bad as it’s being portrayed is puzzling. I’ll wait for it on HBO Max or something though I’m not really interested since I think the Crock has become nothing more than a bland and gullible bitch who refuses to take risks as an actor and play it safe.  It’s time for the Tribal Chief to make the Crock acknowledge him dammit!!!!!  It’s also time for the Crock to do the job for the honorary Uce in Sami Zayn.  I love him as my honorable Uce. It’s crazy man. I’m not sure what fellow critics were looking for, but you could sense this was going to happen even before the first screenings. It’s crazy.  I 100% believe Black Adam isn’t for everyone. But it’s completely honest about what it is. It doesn’t overthink things. It sets up some really cool possibilities for the DCEU going forward. It has some cracking new characters.  And it also touches on some surprisingly rich themes such as colonialism, foreign intervention (or the lack there of), and the questionable definition of a “hero”. Nothing deep, but in a way that very few of these superhero movies do. I dunno. I had a really good time with it. This one didn’t work for me as well as I wanted it too, but I still had a good time at the movies.  I just wish it was less….Snydery. I’ve been pouring through critic reviews trying to understand why Black Adam is getting harsh reviews whereas other superhero films have comparatively light on criticism in its reviews. It’s annoyingly bias to me. I understand this protagonist and style of movie might lend itself to disliking the film. But it just feels like critics were shockingly lazy in their analysis of the film. You’re the 1st critic out of 12 that I found that were positive about Black Adam but also pointed out its flaws as well. This review felt more balanced than the negative reviews I read. Thanks for that. I try to be fair but always honest. I’ll say this, I really don’t understand the disdain and dismissal from fellow critics. I get it not being for everyone, but this is far from a “bad movie”. And when I look at some of the other superhero movies/television shows that has gotten wildly positive marks, all I can do is shake my head. Finally had a chance to see Black Adam and from the perspective of all that’s happened in the DCEU , I really enjoyed it. I thought Johnson was understated , menacing and very good . The Justice Society was cool and overall fun to see . I don’t get the negativity of most critics. I enjoyed it more than most of the recent MCU movies and better than half of the rest of the MCU. Sadly the cameo of Cavill ,which was so great , is wasted now with Gunn taking over and wrongly in my opinion, ditching Cavill who I love as Superman. Plus it’s a shame Black Adam looks now to be a possible footnote with the new direction.Too bad , I would like to see more  I’d give it too a solid 7.5 . Great to hear. The mass criticism it has received has been frustrating. I’m guessing much of it is the hyper pro-Marvel sentiment. Sadly we’ll never get another BA movie and probably no more Justice Society. What a shame. I am also surprised that Dwayne John is starring in this movie. I bet his character is very different than his portrayal of Maui in “Moana.” Hey Steven, thanks for reading. I’m definitely at odds with the majority of fellow critics on this one. And to be honest, I’m not surprised. Some of the chatter prior to the movie’s release had me wondering if there was some kind of baked-in push-back to the movie. I’m not saying that’s the case, because I certainly have no absolute proof. But it’s far better than the criticism would have you believe. I went and watched it a second time just to see. It only reinforced my enjoyment of the film."
"Oct 24, 2022",negative," 'Black Adam' has a crisis of personality, not just in the movie's plot, but in itself. When we're first introduced to Teth-Adam, he spends about five minutes throwing CGI characters around like rag dolls, zapping them with electricity, and generally being a superhero. When confronted by Sarah Shahi's character and her on-screen son, Bodhi Sabongui, he says that he's not a hero and never claimed to be one. Kahndaq, the fictitious Middle Eastern country where the action is set, needs one. Can he be that for them? Of course he can. It's all but certain that he's going to be that. Yet, still, he wants everyone to know that he's not a hero. Especially when he's being a hero. 'Black Adam' presents itself as this kind of antidote to the cookie-cutter superhero movie we've seen dozens of times before, that its hero is really an anti-hero, that he kills people when others would let them live, and that he fundamentally represents something different. Except this isn't really true. Batman, Captain America, and Iron Man - they've all killed people in the past. Sure, they might equivocate over and dodge around it, but that's really what they essentially do. Here in 'Black Adam', however, they want you to know that he does it and he doesn't care if you know it. Challenging stuff. Dwayne Johnson is utterly miscast in the lead role. Sure, he's a physically fearsome presence on screen, twice the size of anyone standing next to him, but he isn't able to exude the kind of danger and threat that the role seemingly requires of him. More to the point, we're supposed to see this journey from grief-stricken avenger to superhero, but his performance is so one-note that it just can't get to either end. He's just hovering around the place, spouting trailerspeak dialogue and frowning at people. The only one who seems to have a handle on things is Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate, who's able to chew scenery like it's a fresh piece of gum. He even turns up in one scene wearing a nifty smoking jacket and a cravat, before rattling through his lines, and then disappearing into the sludge of CGI effects that surround the movie. Jaume Collet-Serra's made a career out of unremarkably entertaining movies, perfect for an aeroplane screen. 'Jungle Cruise' was decent enough fun, and undoubtedly the reason he got the job here. 'Non-Stop', 'The Commuter', and 'Run All Night' were some of Liam Neeson's action highlights, and 'Orphan' is good, trashy fun. 'Black Adam', however, is clearly leaning on Zack Snyder's visual language to translate a relatively unknown quantity in Black Adam to an audience. There's lots of gold in the costumes, there's a lot of hand-wringing over powers, and there are slow-motion scenes set to Spotify favourites like 'Paint It, Black' (see what they did there?!) and Kanye West (which will probably be swapped out for something else in the home release). The reason for all this isn't that he's trying to blend 'Black Adam' in with the existing DCEU landscape - because that doesn't even exist anymore. It's probably got to do with the fact that Jaume Collet-Serra doesn't really have any unique visual style of his own. He's perfectly happy to look at what's been done before, take a few pointers, and generally just play it again with his cast. Compared to something like 'Shazam!' or even lesser entries like 'Aquaman', 'Black Adam' is remarkably drab and bland. The CGI looks cut-price and sloppy, the dialogue is stock superhero schlock, and the plot is equally so. Even when it tries to say something interesting about the role of interventionism or power structures, it doesn't have the strength to commit to them in a meaningful way. 'Black Adam' blasts through the action, but it ends itself at a logical point and then strings the action on for another half hour, where a CGI villain in the shape of a Satan-inspired GigaChad appears for no particular reason whatsoever, all before it resolves exactly as you'd expect."
"Oct 24, 2022",negative," We are a society living under a Rock, as in, former wrestler-turned-actor and entertainer Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.  There are few times when his involvement in a project doesn't guarantee our engagement. With a career in film and television spanning over 20 years, Johnson has built his brand on sarcastic humor, white-toothed charm and ultra-masculine strength. That hard work ethic and powerful fandom of fervent admirers have led to this: Johnson as the titular character in a DC Comics feature film, a sign of prestige, popularity and, above all else, the studio's confidence in his ability to rake in the ticket sales. The heavy-handed caveat about his lead role in ""Black Adam,"" however, is that Black Adam, a deviant ancient being with untenable superpowers, mega physical strength and the ultimate impenetrability, is also morally corrupt and operates as a rogue champion of his enslaved people in the timeworn city of Kahndaq, a nondescript Middle Eastern metropolis. In layman's terms, Black Adam is the villain, not the hero one may expect. Given our association with Johnson as the perpetual ""good guy"", it would be much easier to grasp him as a ""villain"" if he were explicitly bad or troubled. The antihero Venom found surprising cult status among fans who reveled in his charming transgression, despite its subpar storyline and its abominable sequel. In contrast, ""Black Adam"" never firmly establishes Teth-Adam, his birth name, as anything other than a misunderstood protector and, at worst, a self-consumed alien deity.  Like a genie in a bottle, Black Adam is released from his tomb in a moment of great need. Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), a scholar of ancient mythology, enters an old cave of wonders in search of a mythical crown forged by demons. Her aim is to guard the dangerous relic from Kahndaq's oppressors whose tyrannical control has forced the people of the ancient city to seek any means of liberation. When she's cornered by the gun-wielding military operatives, Adrianna speaks the words - ending in the now famous calling queue ""Shazam!"" - and demands the city's fallen protector to do his work, namely blow up all the people hounding her and keep her resourceful son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui). Unlike Robin Williams' ebullient genie, Johnson's Black Adam enters the stage with little fanfare, stamping out the fight without hardly lifting a finger. He's all-powerful and invincible, a doozy of a combination played with monotone stoicism by a normally effusive Johnson. His flat delivery may call to mind another body builder-turned-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The difference between Black Adam and The Terminator, however, is that the latter is a robot designed to kill without human ethics getting in the way and the former was a human whose personal backstory (death of his family, political injustice, you know the drill) should give Johnson a much deeper, complex character to dig into.  It is the writing, perhaps, that muddies Black Adam to the point of near obscurity, wiping away any proper establishment of character until all that is left is a meathead magician who can spar with jets of electricity and drop his foes from the middle of the ozone layer. Assigned to contain and detain the antihero is Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) and flying Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), who leads the Justice Society team on a mission doomed from the start. Despite their combined powers - Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), some kind of mystical relative to Dr. Strange; Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), the new kid with the ability to grow ten times his size; and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), a wind witch who can manipulate air into a tornado - Black Adam can flick them away like annoying ants, putting his lack of weakness on repetitive display. As the film progresses, it becomes painfully clear that there is no epic villain to stretch Black Adam to his breaking point or make him realize that he's actually one of the good guys. Ishmael (Marwan Kenzari), one of Adrianna's collaborators, has ambition for world domination and becomes a fairly generic horned devil king thanks to the plagued crown, forging his reign on the backs of corpses he raises from the dead. Black Adam and the Justice Society must come together to save Kahndaq, even if as a temporary collaboration and not a binding peace treaty. ""Black Adam"" certainly isn't meritless. Centineo's character is included purely for comic relief, and even Johnson sneaks in some dry-humored laughs. There are enough different ways Adam pulverizes his adversaries to retain audience attention. For some, a mildly interesting comic book movie may just be enough. But for those hoping that a Dwayne Johnson superhero film will paint the town black, it'll feel a little colorless."
"Oct 24, 2022",negative," With a seemingly unlimited CGI budget, one of the most charismatic and one of the most high paid actors of our time, plus Viola Davis and Pierce Brosnan, I expected to much more. I mean, I love Dwayne Johnson just as much as the next girl, maybe even more, but from start to finish his signature panache is cloaked in a black shroud as he looms and hovers and glares. One or two quips must get us through the entire two-plus hour explode-a-thon. Director Jaume Collet-Serra, who did a decent job on Jungle Cruise, has come up with a film that is ridiculous, overcooked and disjointed from the start. That’s when Black Adam, an original, super-juiced, man-god who has been out of commission for 5,000 years, is released and set free to ravage at whim or not (he can’t decide). He has to contend with an unfamiliar world, a pack of B-list superheroes sent to reign him in, and a corrupt regime that is oppressing the citizens of the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq, where Black Adam was born all those millennia ago. Throughout the film characters and audiences are relentlessly pummeled by lightning bolts, fiery jolts and villainous dolts with such intense abandon that thumbs start subconsciously twitching for a fast forward button. And yet, it goes on and on, with one ludicrous plot “twist” after another. Just when you think you’re about to be released from Black Adam’s immortal coil, the damn film starts all over again, and there’s an army of the dead to contend with. Please! Make it stop! Still, it pays to endure to the end. That post-credit scene that must be included in all super hero movies is one of the best parts of the film. Well intentioned to be sure, it’s hard to find much to like about this unfortunate misfire. So many resources and opportunities regrettably wasted. How is the Rock ever going to be elected president when he’s involved in such an epic fail?  Products recommended by At Home In Hollywood are selected by our editorial team.

"Oct 24, 2022",negative," Much like Sony/Marvel’s Morbius earlier this year, Warner Bros/New Line Cinema/DC’s latest cinematic superhero showcase Black Adam is nothing more than a splashy, two-hour coming-attractions reel for future films. It’s a better motion picture overall than that earlier one was, and there are certainly a few moments that forced me to sit up slightly straighter and pay moderately more attention. But that doesn’t mean I’m giving this one a recommendation. Far from it. I’m not familiar enough with the character created by Otto Binder and C.C. Beck to know how closely director Jaume Collet-Serra (Jungle Cruise, The Shallows) and writers Adam Sztykiel (Rampage), Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani’s (The Mauritanian) mirror the source material. Not that it matters. It’s like the team took a Superhero Storytelling 101 course and this is their final project. It’s connect-the-dots filmmaking, and precious little comes alive or ever feels emotionally authentic. That’s a shame. There are plenty of commendable building blocks that Collet-Serra and his team lay down as a foundation. They’ve populated their world with a talented cross-section of established superstars and promising newcomers. They’ve chosen a uniquely intriguing Middle Eastern setting for all the chaos and carnage. They broach several complex topics that pertain to international peacekeeping and all that goes with it. They just don’t do anything substantive with any of it. Everything is rushed through and glossed over. Why the fictional country of Kahndaq is under the thumb of a multicultural gang of surprisingly well-equipped thugs known as “Intergang” isn’t clear. The left-field connection of the mysterious “big bad” to the film’s 2600 BCE prologue and the person who has been secretly pulling the strings of this country’s occupation is underdeveloped and poorly revealed. These are only a handful of this production’s issues. It’s as if a new item springs forth every other minute to shake one’s head at in annoyance. For every terrific moment — and there are terrific moments — there are at least four or five that are either obnoxious or troublesome (or both). With rare exceptions, there is no momentum to the action, and even less urgency. Also, the ancient magical crown the evildoers are trying to get their claws on is a throwaway McGuffin that serves zero purpose until the random second it’s needed — and then all hell literally breaks loose. This comic book tale revolves around Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson). Having been asleep for 5,000 years, the fabled Kahndaqian “hero” is released from his stone prison by Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), a tomb-raiding freedom fighter who has been a major thorn in Intergang’s side. A group of powerful wizards led by the original Shazam! (Djimon Hounsou) bestowed upon Adam the power to overthrow an evil king, but his anger got the better of him and he almost destroyed the entire country instead of saving it from tyranny. Few know that part of the story, and this includes Adrianna’s adventurous teenage son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui). He looks at Adam and only sees his country’s savior. But Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) knows exactly who they are dealing with. She sends the leader of the Justice Society (or JSA) Carter Hall, aka Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), and a small band of fellow heroes to Kahndaq in hopes they can convince Adam to surrender before he starts making an angry and vengeful menace of himself. What follows are a series of disconnected scenes in which Adam rips through Intergang like butter, bonds with Amon as the latter tries to teach him how to be a superhero, and has a couple of fights with Hawkman and his compatriots Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), the latter two out on their first save-the-world assignment from Waller. There is also the search for that aforementioned mystical crown, as the person who unlocks its secrets will tap into some seriously demonic, potentially world-ending powers. The first fight sequence between Adam and Intergang after his awakening is borderline awful. Collet-Serra attempts to channel his inner Zack Snyder and fails miserably. But the director redeems himself with the first confrontation between the awakened antihero and the JSA. This is a nicely staged slugfest that does a solid job of spotlighting everyone’s various powers without the aid of individual origin stories. From there, one confrontation leads to another, with spontaneous bits of (mostly worthless) exposition sprinkled throughout. Yet all of this leads nowhere and only sets up character motivations and scenarios destined to be explored in future adventures, not this one. Even the climax doesn’t resonate, and no matter how final the decisions by some of the characters may prove to be, these sacrifices carry no weight and even less meaning. The cast does what they can, especially Hodge and Brosnan, both of whom are excellent. But it’s not enough. Collet-Serra’s sojourn into comic book theatrics is tedious and never justifies its existence other than to suggest what’s on the horizon for DC’s catalog of heroes. In all its zeal to expand this universe, the film forgets about the here and now. It’s going to be a hit. There will be sequels. This character will return. But that doesn’t change my reaction.

"Oct 23, 2022",negative," The latest DC spectacular is a film conjured by the internet, with Dwayne Johnson linked to the role by eager fans since at least the mid-2000s. The former wrestler’s armour has been slightly dented by the failures of Jungle Cruise and Red Notice last year, can Black Adam put him back on top? Set in the fictional country of Kahndaq, Johnson plays Teth Adam, a former slave bestowed with superpowers who is imprisoned for 5,000 years when he uses those gifts for vengeance. Awakened in the present day, he has little interest in being the saviour of his home, but protects the mother and son who released him as they are terrorised by a military force. With superhero team The Justice Society looking to imprison him on the orders of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), Teth Adam must decide if he is the world’s reckoning, or its guardian.  The character is linked to the Shazam films, but clearly intended to reinvigorate the stuttering DC Universe. Disappointingly, there’s little here that distinguishes itself from the many comic book movies already available. There’s more magical items, more mythology to digest quickly, and another vaguely foreign city to save. Director Jaume Collet-Serra plays it safe, delivering a story that has explosions in all the right places, but nothing distinct.  The central moral conflict, where we question whether the Justice Society are actually the good guys, feels reminiscent of Marvel’s Falcon and Winter Soldier, but nowhere near as nuanced. Being content with formula means that the script’s insistence that this is a new kind of hero feels laughable, particularly when the film reportedly cut some R-Rated deaths intended to establish the character’s vindictive streak. Like Henry Cavill in Man of Steel, Johnson is better than the film that surrounds him. The most electrifying personality in Hollywood is muffled by a deadpan persona in the first half of the movie, only warming up as he bonds with likeable young co-star Bodhi Sabongui. The Justice Society give it their best, with Pierce Brosnan the standout as Dr Fate.  He may get hammy toward the end, but noone can accuse the former 007 of not taking his role seriously. Newbie heroes Atom Smasher and Cyclone (Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell) are a sweet duo, while Sarah Shahi is the film’s heart as a resistance fighter who uncovers Adam’s prison. Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman is burdened with a lot of moralising dialogue, but gives the film purpose in between CGI battles.  Black Adam is a standard superhero movie, executed sleekly and designed to bring the most bang for your buck. However, despite the best efforts of Johnson, it may be a film that’s only remembered for its explosive mid-credits reveal. "
"Oct 23, 2022",negative," We've all read the stories over the past few months: Dwayne Johnson has arrived to save the DC Universe from itself. After years of meandering and uncertainty, the DC Comics film series has fallen into disrepair. Batman and Superman have been left to stagnate, Aquaman and Wonder Woman are churning out sequels as we speak, and The Suicide Squad and Shazam! movies seem to be living in completely separate universes. Black Adam attempts to rectify these wider problems within the franchise, and - for the most part - succeeds. It's just a shame the film itself is painfully dull. Black Adam (or Teth-Adam, as he's known for most of the film) is an ancient being blessed with powers from the gods and is resurrected after 5,000 years of slumber. What is his purpose? What does he want? What master or fight does he want to champion? Unfortunately, most of these questions are never answered. What's worse is that Johnson plays an unfortunately bland rendition of the memorable DC supervillain throughout the two-hour epic. While it certainly feels like he gives as good a performance as he can in the film, the writing is completely lacking. Black Adam, as a person, is paper thin and entirely gormless in many scenes where emotion and weight would have helped (a lot). On one side, DC fans will be thrilled to learn the Justice Society are some of the best heroes ever shown on the big screen. Made up of Cyclone, Atom Smasher, Hawkman and Doctor Fate, these newcomers are interesting, flawed, powerful and endearing throughout the entire picture. Surely some of this creativity and love could have gone into some of the other superhero romps from Warner Bros in the past few years? On the other side, the ""human"" characters helping Black Adam in their quest to save the world (or something like that, probably) were just truly, painfully irritating. Adrianna, a university professor (apparently?) and her son, Amon, plague the movie with their presence in almost every scene. Nothing they say is, really, of consequence, and a lot of their dialogue could simply be cut out. Thankfully, the monotony these characters bring to the big screen is often split up by some exhilarating action sequences. What Black Adam lacks in precision he makes up for in showmanship. He is firmly brutal, to all who oppose him, and the CGI work on his powers - and Doctor Fate's - are particularly spellbinding. Unfortunately, as a viewer, there's nothing to really get behind in the story. The evil crown everyone is looking for feels like an absolute afterthought. And the final, 11th-hour villain, Sabbac, barely says two lines before inevitably being defeated. Ultimately, the only thing more forgettable than his name is his secret plan for world domination. Regardless of how imperfect Black Adam is, the film does have some brief moments of greatness. Pierce Brosnan shines as Doctor Fate, and Hawkman has a powerful presence during every commanding moment. Johnson plays his role well, but it isn't deep enough for my liking. With a real battle on his hands, and maybe even some stakes, the antihero could be an excitingly memorable big-screen character. Until then, you can wait until this hits streaming services."
"Oct 23, 2022",negative," Cheaper, trashier, perhaps even dumber films have been saved by the presence of Dwayne Johnson. So why is DC’s latest so doggedly immune to the redemptive power of the Rock? The key is in the secret ingredient: the priceless element that bestows unimaginable power on its owner. In this story, with its cobbled-together, disingenuously generic Middle Eastern backdrop, it’s allegedly a rare stone called Eternium. But in fact this is a red herring. The most valuable element, the one that unlocks Johnson’s considerable appeal, is rather more prosaic: humour. Give the man a couple of jokes and he works magic. Starve him of gags – as this loud, baffling screenplay does – and what’s left is stony-faced, gravel-voiced posturing. Johnson plays an all-powerful entity called Teth-Adam, the saviour of the country of Kahdaq. But he has been interred in a sacred mountain for millennia; meanwhile, his country has been pillaged by invaders. Teth-Adam is reawakened by Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), apparently some kind of scholar, but who knows? The film doesn’t dignify her with much in the way of a backstory. Meanwhile, Viola Davis has dispatched the Justice Society to neutralise Adam. The ancient archaeological sites of Kahdaq take the brunt of it all."
"Oct 23, 2022",negative," It turns out that 5,000 years ago, the city (or country) of Kahndaq was ruled by an evil king, Anh-Kot, who made his enslaved people dig for a magical crystal called Eternium, which would then be used to create the all-powerful Crown of Sabbac. You can guess why the king wanted this particular crown, since it would bestow upon him great powers, etc. Amid a revolution against Anh-Kot, a slave named Teth-Adam (Johnson) lost his son but received the powers of Shazam. He then became a very powerful warrior who has been entombed ever since. Fast forward to the present and Kahndaq is a modern city now occupied by invaders known as Intergang. We then meet archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi), who is conducting a dig in search of the infamous Crown of Sabbac. She also has a pre-teen son, Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), who worships superheroes. Inevitably, Adrianna accidentally reads an ancient inscription that awakens Teth-Adam, but just in time when Interangers surround her. Decked in black with a yellow thunderbolt, Teth-Adam (soon to be called Black Adam) annihilates enemies with no mercy, until the Justice Society, a band of heroes supervised by the government, drop in to stop him. It quickly dawns on the viewer that a lot of “Black Adam” simply recycles everything that has been done before, to an obvious degree. DC is now turning into a big studio equivalent of those straight-to-video productions that would try to ape big hits in the ‘80s and ‘90s. For every “Conan the Barbarian” you would get “The Barbarians.” This movie is obviously chasing after “Black Panther.” Instead of Wakanda, we get Kahndaq, and as in Wakanda they covet Vibranium, here we get Eternium. Light political allegory abounds in how both nations are threatened by fictional imperialist interests. Imagine a bolder “Black Adam” where Kahndaq would be a commentary on Iraq or Gaza, but we’re talking unabashed commerce here. Even the way Black Adam crashes into a mini crater and is found by Adrianna and goofy colleague Karim (Mohammed Amer), is almost a shot-for-shot re-do of how Natalie Portman meets Chris Hemsworth in “Thor.” Dwayne Johnson is then allowed to flex some of his comedic chops by playing another take on the muscled dummy lacking a sense of humor, but is expected to liberate his people from modern invaders. He has no sense of irony and kills every opponent by throwing them high in the air, because that’s how it was done in ancient times. He also flies a lot and smashes through walls.  By now director Jaume Collet-Serra should be mentioned, even if his style or voice is nowhere to be found in what amounts to another franchise for-hire gig. Serra is best known for atmospheric thrillers like “The Shallows” and “Orphan.” Here he’s chained to the drained aesthetic established by Zack Snyder for all DC movies since “Man of Steel.” We also get the required slow motion action sequences where people leap, impale others and fall off cliffs which could have been shot by Snyder himself, or lifted from his “300.” There’s little grace or originality to any of the violence in this movie, as if we’re watching an automated system. Room also has to be made for the whole new superhero team thrown at us for yet another franchise expansion. The Justice Society is just copies of copies. There’s Hawkman (Aldis Hodge in a costume where we admire his courage in delivering lines while wearing it), Dr. Fate (a relaxed Pierce Brosnan), who wears a gold helmet and can see the future, Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo seeming to imitate Mark Ruffalo), who can grow very big à la “Ant-Man,” and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), who can control powerful winds but does little of that during the movie. They are linked to the overall DC universe through Viola Davis, who returns as government overseer Amanda Waller from “The Suicide Squad.” There’s another link in the bonus end credits scene, which will either inspire a tired sigh or excited fist pump, depending on how invested you are in this franchise. The rest of “Black Adam” follows the playbook of everything else, including “Wonder Woman” by giving us a villain, Ishmael (Marwan Kenzari), who turns into a flaming demon from hell Black Adam then proceeds to pummel through a lot of wreckage. What is sorely lacking, especially with an anti-hero story, is the satire and dark humor of someone like James Gunn, who last year gave DC its most original burst of creativity with “The Suicide Squad.” That one had its own aesthetic and wicked charm. This one simply continues a stale line of factory films. DC has been suffering from an incoherent form of world-building, where random art projects like “Joker” swirl around with big-budget spectacles like “Aquaman” (which is “Titanic” compared to “Black Adam”). None of it connects and even that should take a back seat to simply telling a good story with craft. “Black Adam” at least features Middle Eastern characters at the forefront, but in expanding representation, it should also try harder at expanding horizons. These are expensive productions for sure, but it doesn’t always have to be about the money."
"Oct 23, 2022",neutral," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzSpanish filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra (“Jungle Cruise”/”The Commuter”) directs this underwhelming big-budget action superhero B film, using the DC Comics characters created by Bill Parker & C.C. Beck. It’s scripted with stilted dialog, confusion over whether the Black Adam anti-hero character can overcome his anger management issues to be accepted as a superhero and there’s little emotional impact created by the writers Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani.It stars the miscast ex-wrestler, Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson, who is not allowed to play his usual ridiculous cheesy character, which is not a good thing for the limited actor  who seems lost here. The Rock plays the former slave, the so-called villain Teth- Adam, a role he is not suited for and can’t plausibly transform into a superhero that would make us care about him.It begins with a narration going through thousands of years of history of the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq. We learn of its slaves, the glowing demonic magical blue crown of power and of it being the place where a villain is someone who opposes the repressive regime. Tet-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) has accidentally been freed from being locked in his prison tomb for 5,000 years, because he led a slave revolt. He’s given super powers by the same wizards from the 2019 “Shazam!” (here played by Djimon Hounsou), and will rise in this  colony city, floating above it, to kill the evil king. Tet-Adam comes into the impoverished modern but futuristic world of Kahndaq as a conflicted, angry man, with godlike powers.The adventurous freedom fighter professor, Adrianna Tammis (Sarah Shahi), an artifact hunter, searches for the demonic ancient crown with her bumbling brother, Karim (Mohammed Amer), and her hero-worshiping son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui). She meets the powerful Teth-Adam, who has no qualms zapping to death any baddie he encounters.Teth-Adam, the slave, who revolted against his oppressive rulers, is considered by the downtrodden dwellers in Kahndaq as their hero, but he still thinks of himself as a villain.Adam’s arrival from the dead features an uninteresting second-rate superhero ragtag group of American characters who call themselves the Justice Society, viewing themselves as the defenders of peace. They include the team of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan); Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell); Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and, the group’s leader, Hawkman (Aldis Hodge). All of them conspiring to take down the angry loose cannon Teth-Adam, who is prepared to unleash his super powers without caring whether or not to do it in a reasoned way. Teth-Adam must decide if he’s to side with a powerful demon Sabbic, sent by his ancient rulers, or to save the modern Kahndaq people from the countries still exploiting it, by battling with the demon. The Justice Society tries stopping the god-like Teth from saving the world in the only way he knows how to act, but can’t.It’s a soulless comic book film (more interested in becoming a money-making franchise than in saying something special about its tragic story and, in the end, offers no payoff). It disappoints with flat characters only sketchily drawn; overwrought rote-like CGI heavy action scenes; an unfinished debate on what’s morally right or wrong about dealing with certain vital issues; and offering little entertainment value or logic in its narrative (too many gaps in its story to make things add up). Only the visuals are arresting, and its fast pace at least keeps it moving along.The  so called Teth-Adam now is named Black Adam, in the third act, where he must learn how to be a superhero.  The film repeats its message throughout–“The world doesn’t need a white knight: sometimes it needs something darker.” It also could use a better superhero film. "
"Oct 23, 2022",negative,"With a horrid script, lackluster performances, and a waste of potentially awesome characters, Black Adam is an explosive, $195 million, anti-heroic dud."
"Oct 22, 2022",positive," Set in 1823, The Woman King takes us to the Kingdom of Dahomey in West Africa. A young new king, Ghezo (Boyega), is threatened with the prospect of colonialism and annihilation by the mighty Oyo Empire but in his corner are the fearsome and unrelenting Agojie - an all-female tribe of warriors led by the formidable Nanisca (Davis). Gina Prince-Bythewood’s historical epic may not be entirely historically accurate, but it carries many truths of the time and the spirit of the warriors with it. Part-action, part-drama, part-commentary, The Woman King manages to conjure the feel and spectacle of an epic whilst managing to retain an intimate atmosphere throughout. The action scenes are captured and choreographed excellently and deliver a raw and realistic experience without ever feeling the need to stray into gory territory, and how these sequences weave with the dramatic elements of the narrative are handled wonderfully. The commentary revolves mainly around colonialism, slavery, and sexual abuse the warriors and women faced, but the bulk of the drama focuses on a young girl, Nawi (Mbedu), who is enlisted in the Agojie after refusing her fathers wishes to marry an older man. We follow her rise, setbacks, and eventual truths thanks to a superb performance from Thuso Mbedu who nearly outshines the spectacular Viola Davis, who, alongside her terrific acting ability, is able to show off just how much of a badass she is. Seeing these two warrior women thrust together on opposing ends of their journeys was a highly intriguing element of the movie powered by two tremendous performances. The rhythmic and pounding score from Terence Blanchard further accentuates the scope of the story, and also provides a lift for the sequences or moments that don’t quite feel as balanced or well-defined - though they are fairly few and far between. The Woman King exists to celebrate the brave warrior women of the Agojie and to humanize them along the way, there is no sexualization or slack-handed messages of empowerment here, just strong yet vulnerable, fearsome but not fearless fighters who fought back against their oppressors and stood up for their beliefs. The Woman King is a first-rate epic combining commanding performances and storming action with a powerful story. David Bruckner has such sights to show us. Well, that was my hope anyway. Hellraiser, a reboot of Clive Barker’s 1987 genre classic, becomes the latest horror staple to be reimagined for contemporary times, though I’d argue that the Hellraiser franchise as a whole isn’t quite as revered as, say, the Halloween series. Not to say that that brings less pressure but potentially less expectation - having said that, this is how you reboot a franchise. 2022’s Hellraiser is not a perfect film, or a perfect horror movie, but it goes out of its way to not simply be the original Hellraiser whilst delivering new lore and fresh takes on an established world. The narrative again focuses on the Lament Configuration being toyed with, paving the way for the hellish Cenobites to come to our dimension to deliver their unique brand of pain and pleasure - here, Odessa A’zion’s Riley attempts to harness the power of the box in order to resurrect her brother who disappeared in mysterious, Cenobite-y circumstances. Where Barker’s Hellraiser was dripping in leather and sex/BDSM, Bruckner’s instead deals with addiction, loss, and the lengths they send us to and it ends up as a successful combination alongside the more standard horror and gore that one would expect from a Hellraiser affair. In doing this, Bruckner ensures we spend more time with the characters ahead of the hellish headliners appearances, and A’Zion is very strong in her performance, however, the same can’t really be levied at the supporting cast around her. In terms of the nasties, Jamie Clayton’s The Priest (Pinhead) is badass, she manages to capture the characters ethereal evil presence whilst also delivering a unique spin on an iconic character (all whilst being used sparingly) - the overall design of the Cenobites is excellent, their fleshy, wet, sinewy appearance feels more unsettling than the biker gang approach of before and the character designs are spot on. The production design of Hellraiser also is strong, this is a great movie to look at visually and technically, the in-camera effects holding up more often than not. Now, Hellraiser clocks in at around two hours and it probably didn’t need to, there are moments where it begins to run the risk of outstaying its welcome, and, whilst it never reaches that point, it was definitely noticeable - and to be picky, I would have liked a few more kills for the list here. For a movie that could have easily gone the way of the more recent (and awful) straight-to-DVD franchise efforts, Hellraiser delivers admirable restraint at times and an exciting take on a flagging franchise - it has its flaws, granted, but there’s also emotion, mystery, some great gore, and an ace turn from Jamie Clayton as The Priest. The hierarchy of power in the DC Universe is about to change. That’s according to Dwayne Johnson, the star of Black Adam when asked to describe…Black Adam. The million-dollar question is, of course, will the hierarchy of power actually change following the release of Black Adam? In short, probably not, no. But, Black Adam is certainly not a disasterpiece - it may not be particularly special or unique, but it has enough. A lengthy opening exposition dump tells us that Adam was once known as Teth Adam 5000 years ago and was a slave in the city of Kahndaq before he was bestowed with God-like powers that led him to enact justice born solely from rage. After being imprisoned (...sigh), he is finally released by mother and son Adrianna (Shahi) and Amon (Sabongui) but his presence doesn’t go unnoticed - the Justice Society (titter...), comprising of Hawkman (Hodge), Dr. Fate (Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Centineo), and Cyclone (Swindell), rock up to try and put an end to Black Adam’s rage whilst a group of angry, gun-wielding nuts are also after a demonically-infused crown that would grant the wielder…God-like powers. It’s a bit heavy in terms of exposition and OTT comic book lore and at many points it all started to feel a little silly, but some fun action sequences and character interactions help prevent this from smelling like Batman vs. Superman. The majority of the movie’s success falls on the beefy shoulders of Johnson, his natural charisma carries the performance, and, despite Black Adam being an antihero of sorts, it’s nigh-on impossible to dislike The Rock - plus his introduction was a nice slice of badass. Similarly, the connection between Brosnan and Hodge was strong, delivering a solid double-act performance that only made the sidelining of Atom Smasher and Cyclone even more egregious. On the other hand, Sabongui’s Amon was bestowed with every bad sequence, line of dialogue, and decision throughout the movie, that character was not a highlight. To be fair, the dialogue throughout is mostly rough but the comedy (outside of Amon) worked well. Many of the action scenes were satisfying, though the repetition became noticeable as did some dodgy CGI but it was hard to shake the feeling of enjoyment throughout. Maybe it was simply seeing a new set of heroes that made Black Adam palatable, I’m not sure, but whilst acknowledging the movie’s flaws, it still remained a fun watch even if the big bad of the movie was a bust. I can’t say whether the hierarchy of power in the DC universe has changed or not, but I can say Black Adam delivers just enough to be on the right side of entertaining. Just. 2022 has been a great year for horror movies (except for you, Halloween Ends, Jeepers Creepers Reborn, Dashcam...) and Zach Cregger’s Barbarian is next up to the plate - but do we get a horror home run or simply a horror show? The story revolves around Georgina Campbell’s Tess who, after arriving at her reserved Airbnb, finds Bill Skarsgård’s Keith already at the property - the issue is that she has no idea who he is. She spends the night there with socially-awkward Keith only to later find that the property harbors nasty secrets that weren’t on the listing. There’s so much more to the story, but Barbarian is absolutely one of those movies where you need to go in blind, and when you do, you’ll be in for a treat. Barbarian is another 2022 horror home run and is packed with atmosphere, tension, gross-out moments, and surprises throughout - it falters at times in the finale, but the vast majority is a dark delight, the movie’s unpredictable narrative elevating what would have otherwise been a strong movie on its own given the setup. The movie is full of twists and misdirects to ensure no one feels too familiar with proceedings and the dark (sometimes satirical) comedy that simmers beneath the surface only adds to the feeling of unease - Cregger excellently balances any levity with real chills. Across the board, the performances are strong, at times playing on the audience's own experiences with the actors, but generally, just performers going all-in for their characters - the impressive Campbell especially. Another impressive aspect of Barbarian is that it received a wide theatrical release as opposed to being dumped on streaming and respect goes to 20th Century Studios for having the confidence to go big on what is not a mainstream horror movie - The Conjuring franchise, this ain’t. To say more about the movie would be to begin giving away too much about a cleverly structured affair, but if you’re a genre fan who doesn’t mind it going a bit further, Barbarian will satiate your needs. A constantly swerving thrill ride, Barbarian is one of the year's strongest horror movies and one that is as wickedly entertaining as it is unnerving. The boys are back in town. Well, an island, actually, and a fictional one at that - Inisherin. The Banshees of Inisherin reunites director Martin McDonagh with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson for a fantastic film that explores friendship, anger, depression, rage, and sadness but all doused with some deliciously dark McDonagh humour. The narrative revolves around Brendan Gleeson's Colm who one day decides he simply does not like his one-time best friend Pádraic (Farrell), the reason being Pádraic’s apparent dullness is preventing Colm from enjoying his final years and leaving behind a musical legacy (he’s a fiddle player). Pádraic takes umbrage with this, alongside a huge dose of confusion, and his attempts to regain his friendship lead to some dark places. Set against the backdrop of 1920s Ireland in the midst of civil war, The Banshees of Inisherin boasts two of the best performances you’ll see this year, both Farrell and Gleeson delivering sumptuous performances that cover so many emotions - Colm is both melancholic and menacing, Pádraic is appealing and frustrating all at once, and their odd couple double act is intoxicating to behold. Both performances carry a sense of fortitude, sadness, and stubbornness that will leave you either smiling, wincing, or crying with the characters. Similarly, Kerry Condon’s bookish Siobhan also delivers excellently as Pádraic’s sister who dreams of more than this small island that offers nothing but beautiful views. Those views are captured wonderfully by returning McDonagh DoP Ben Davis, the rolling hills of Inishmore doubling for Inisherin and providing a beautifully rural slice of the world to set this hard-hitting tragicomedy. Alongside the performances, McDonagh’s fizzing screenplay further elevates the story and simultaneously allows for many scenes of laughter and moments of awe - every aspect of the film is simply strong and everything combines to create a starkly profound, and sometimes devastating, experience. A story of alienation and mortality, this meditative and dark dramedy delivers sensational performances, high emotion, and one of the year’s best films - if not the best."
"Oct 22, 2022",negative," A needlessly dark pile of steaming genre trash that takes itself way more seriously than it should, Black Adam is still pretty entertaining in parts. It would be inaccurate to say that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has never been in a bad movie. He’s almost never been in a good movie. But he’s The Rock, and that seems to be all that matters to the audience. This is a DC comics movie, so there are immortal gods, an indestructible substance, lightning bolts and fire coming out of people’s chests, and people hurling other people into buildings. The Rock plays a slave from a society older than Babylon (that’s old) who acquires powers that he can’t control. So a bunch of wizards imprison him a tomb. A determined anti-colonialist college professor, well-played by the appealing Sarah Shahi, unearths him 5,000 years later by saying a magic word, and the game is on. Black Adam winks and quips and bulges out of a Spandex suit that can barely hold his massivity, which was enough for the phalanx of chortling Comic Book Guys who were in the theater with me. In an early sequence, he murders hundreds of people while ‘Paint It Black’ plays on the soundtrack, a mix of seriousness and irony that befuddles the rest of the movie as well. Meanwhile, something called “The Justice Society,” which has never before appeared in a DC movie product, and which, as is the DC way, this movie barely bothers to introduce. They zip off from headquarters, mysteriously located in Louisiana, to the Middle East to stop Black Adam. These are the “heroes” that the movie deploys to  crank on its Black Adam anti-hero with increasing futility. The murky script never gives them anything interesting to say, fills in their backstories with expository dialogue, and gives them very little to do other than kick ass based on their various powers. Fortunately for us, they’re all pretty engaging to watch. Pierce Brosnan plays Dr. Fate, basically DC’s version of Dr. Strange, who has a golden helmet that allows him to bend reality and see through time. Brosnan brings dignity and gravitas to some ludicrous dialogue, and has something close to a complete story arc, though only because he gives us his origin story in a monologue. Aldis Hodge, last seen effectively playing Jim Brown in ‘One Night In Miami,’ is Hawkman, a top-20 DC character. The movie doesn’t explain who Hawkman is, why he is the leader of the Justice Society, why he has a super spaceship located in a secret Louisiana headquarters, or why he has magical Hawk armor or wields a mystical mace. We’ve never seen this character in another DC movie (though he has shown up from time to time on TV), so liking him requires a knowledge of Hawkman and a willingness to say, “whoa, that’s Hawkman.” Considering that he basically exists for other characters to pummel into the ground constantly, Hodge still does a really nice job with Hawkman, leaving me and the Comic Book Guys to think “I’d see a Hawkman movie.” The other two members of the team are Atom Smasher and Cyclone, both of whom are pretty cute, but we don’t know much about them other than that Atom Smasher got his costume from Henry Winkler and some evil scientist injected nanobots into Cyclone’s blood. They make a few quips and occasionally wink at each other. In the last 20 minutes, we meet the CGI villain, who is a demon without a personality. These characters are all basically props for Black Adam, and for The Rock. Unlike the rest of the characters, Black Adam gets approximately three origin stories in this movie, though the story keeps changing through a series of dusty and predictable flashbacks that allow us to see The Rock in a loincloth, which must be in his contract. We also follow a boring but demographically necessary modern Middle Eastern family as Black Adam “saves” their city and their home by progressively turning it into rubble, which they don’t seem to mind for some reason. They have more lives than the average superhero. It’s one thing for Superman to emerge from the rubble time and again. It’s another to see a 12-year-old skateboarding whiz survive an insane amount of supernatural abuse with barely a scratch. But this is an approach that DC seems to take a lot when it comes to “liberating” foreign lands. James Gunn’s Suicide Squad ravaged Latin America for laughs. Black Adam pillages the Arab world for our amusement. Though there’s some sort of anticolonialist message hiding underneath this movie’s ample capes, it exists mostly to serve a series of slow-motion fight scenes, bland speechifying, and murky cinematography. In the end, it doesn’t really matter. Unlike ‘Ms. Marvel,’ or ‘Moon Knight,’ which made excellent use of actual mythologies and histories to spotlight cultures that American entertainment has degraded or neglected, Black Adam features a made-up country, a made-up pantheon, and made-up and generic problems. The so-called Third World exists in this universe for one reason alone: to show off The Rock’s rack. Maybe, given how much the world loves The Rock, and given an awesome end credits sequence promising much more, that’s enough.

"Oct 22, 2022",positive," At this point, it’s reasonable to not realize the “DC Extended Universe” is still something in active development. From its multitude of canceled or delayed projects, to the near-constant stream of controversies surrounding DCEU films and shows, to all of the well-publicized studio dysfunction behind the scenes, it’s amazing that any project makes it to the screen amid all of that chaos. And yet, Black Adam has finally arrived in theaters — a feat seemingly accomplished through the sheer force of will of its star, Dwayne Johnson, who’s been dragging it toward production for more than a decade now. It’s an OK film, too — mainly due to Johnson’s boundless charisma — but it falls far short of being the course-correcting cinematic spectacle the DCEU is desperately in need of. Directed by Jungle Cruise and Orphan filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra, Black Adam casts Johnson as Teth-Adam, a former slave who was granted the powers of Egyptian gods to protect humanity, only to end up destroying his homeland of Kahndaq while seeking vengeance for his murdered family. Imprisoned for more than 5,000 years by the same wizards who imbued him with near-invincible power, Teth-Adam is awakened by an archaeologist searching for a powerful relic to free modern-day Kahndaq from a vicious mercenary network. Teth-Adam’s explosive resurrection and the resulting slaughter of the mercenaries soon puts him on the radar of the Justice Society of America, a team of superheroes tasked with maintaining international peace, who must decide whether he’s a potential enemy or ally to the world. Johnson is joined in the cast by Aldis Hodge (Straight Outta Compton, One Night in Miami) as JSA leader Carter Hall (aka Hawkman), Pierce Brosnan (GoldenEye) as the superhero sorcerer Kent Nelson (aka Doctor Fate), Quintessa Swindell (Voyagers) as wind-controlling hero Maxine Hunkel (aka Cyclone), and Noah Centineo (To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before) as size-changing, aspiring hero Al Rothstein (aka Atom Smasher). Outside of the film’s superpowered characters, Sarah Shahi (Sex/Life) portrays the archaeologist who awakens Teth-Adam, Bodhi Sabongui (The Baby-Sitters Club) plays her son, and comedian and actor Mohammed Amer (Mo) plays her brother. Marwan Kenzari (Aladdin) plays the Intergang member in pursuit of the powerful relic known as the Crown of Sabbac. It’s a crowded cast, but as the title suggests, Johnson’s superpowered character is the focal point of the story, and his performance often drags it back to center whenever the meandering, overstuffed narrative begins to wander. For much of the film, Black Adam feels like a project uncertain of exactly what type of film it wants to be, and as such, it borrows elements from various DCEU films before it. That would be fine if the DCEU films maintained a relatively consistent tone akin to their counterparts at Marvel, but franchise studio Warner Bros. prides itself on letting each DCEU film deliver a standalone experience. The tone of Black Adam pinballs from the silly superhero hijinks of 2019’s Shazam! to the darker filter of Zack Snyder’s grim and gritty, hero-averse version of the DC Comics universe to the CG-fueled, brawny action spectacle of 2018’s Aquaman over and over again, allowing little time for any overarching aesthetic to take root. Johnson’s Teth-Adam — who is compelled to remind everyone that he’s not a hero and is totally OK with killing people at least once every five minutes — bounces between angsty contemplation of his tragic backstory and trying to nail down a snappy catchphrase, alternately injecting humor and bleakness in moments where they seemingly don’t belong. The film’s decision to make Teth-Adam’s willingness to kill villains his primary, defining characteristic is also puzzling given that WB and DCEU filmmakers have spent a decade insisting that superhero characters killing people is no big deal. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and countless other DCEU heroes have killed hundreds of villains across their DCEU films, so the suggestion that Teth-Adam’s approach to justice is somehow at odds with what the world understands superheroes to be feels forced (at best) in Black Adam, and verges on laughably unaware the more often this sentiment is reiterated in the film. Black Adam also borrows from one of the most-maligned recurring elements of DCEU films to date, closing with a CG-fueled villain battle that is so mired in digital effects that it would look just as (if not more) comfortable in a video game cutscene. This is an issue that isn’t reserved to just DCEU films — the Marvel Cinematic Universe has made that mistake more than once, too — but it’s been a particularly disappointing element in some of the studio’s standout films so far. Wonder Woman and Aquaman, two of the best DCEU films to date, both concluded with frantic, confusing sequences of CG mayhem that ended otherwise entertaining adventures on a down note, while films like Justice League and Suicide Squad (the 2016 film, not James Gunn’s 2021 reboot) turned into glorified game cinematics nearly every time action unfolded. Johnson is one of the most capable action actors in Hollywood these days, so it’s a shame to see him reduced to a head in a motion capture suit, all wrapped in visual effects, as often happens in Black Adam. Johnson is endlessly fun to watch in just about anything he does, and it’s his charm and charisma that elevates Black Adam above its long list of flaws. He’s the rare actor who can effortlessly pivot between heartbreaking pathos, smirking humor, and intimidating self-assurance, and he puts all of these — and other — aspects of performance to frequent use in the film. Without him, Black Adam is one of the worst DCEU films to date, but with him, it’s an entertaining experience that sits somewhere within the highest tier of entries in a frustratingly disappointing cinematic universe. While the crowded cast is light on standout performances from anyone other than Johnson, Brosnan does deliver a memorable performance as the enigmatic Doctor Fate, who feels like the supporting character most deserving of another appearance in the DCEU. Both Swindell and Centineo are fun to watch in limited screen time too, although that has more to do with the spectacle of their powers than their performances in the film, which doesn’t give them much to work with as characters when they’re not engaged in battle. Although Black Adam manages to be an entertaining film thanks to its star’s performance, even Johnson himself can’t manage all the heavy lifting required to turn the film into the franchise-changing project the studio seems to hope it will be. Flashy and fun at times, but overly reliant on its star and a cohesive vision for the DCEU that it neither projects nor even exists at this point, Black Adam offers mountains of potential without much payoff. Audiences looking for an escapist adventure without any meaningful mental or emotional connection to the story — preferably with bright colors, plenty of explosions, and cringeworthy jokes — will likely leave Black Adam satisfied. Those looking for something deeper, though, aren’t likely to be as happy with the film’s return on their investment. It’s no secret that the DCEU needs something big to turn it around and unlock its potential, and unfortunately, Black Adam isn’t that project. It is, however, a relatively entertaining film. For now, it seems like that will have to do. Warner Bros. Pictures’ Black Adam is in theaters now. For a spoiler-filled overview of the film, including the explosive ending, check out our Black Adam’s ending explained article. The Black Phone is at its best when it's working with as little as possible. A majority of the new film from Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson takes place in a grimy basement, but it manages to make the most out of its central confined space — filling it with intimidating shadows and secrets for its protagonist to discover over the course of The Black Phone’s 102-minute runtime. Based on a short story of the same name by Stephen King’s son, Joe Hill, the film follows a young boy who gets kidnapped by a notorious child killer and has only a few days to escape before he becomes the man’s next victim. Have you ever wondered why Dwayne Johnson has dedicated over a decade of his life to bringing Black Adam to the big screen? As originally conceived, Black Adam was just a villain who was the darker reflection of Shazam (back when he was still allowed to be called Captain Marvel). Within the last two decades, Black Adam's portrayal in the comics has shifted from an unrepentant bad guy to an antihero who isn't truly evil. But it's a real stretch to call him a good guy. The first trailer for Black Adam shows off some of the title character's impressive powers after he is freed in modern times. This may be one of the reasons why Johnson was so drawn to him. Black Adam has Superman-level strength, and no desire to hold back. The Man of Steel may prove to be more powerful, but Black Adam's ruthless streak may place him on a higher plateau. As the film's tagline says, ""The hierarchy of the DC Universe is about to change."" In 2019, Adam Sandler proved he still has what it takes to be one of Hollywood’s most versatile and charismatic performers with his performance in the Safdie Brothers’ adrenaline-fueled Uncut Gems. Not since 2002’s Punch-Drunk Love had Sandler played a character so different from his usual goofball archetype, and he earned some well-deserved acclaim for his turn as the film's self-destructive lead. But Uncut Gems did more than just reaffirm Sandler’s status as a more versatile leading man than his filmography would have you believe. The film also offered the promise of being the first entry in a new chapter in Sandler’s career, one featuring more variety and legitimately dramatic stories from the Happy Gilmore star than viewers had seen in previous years. While it remains to be seen if that’s the direction Sandler’s career will ultimately take in the coming years, Hustle certainly seems to suggest that it might be.

"Oct 22, 2022",negative," Part of the beauty of the Justice Society of America in the nearly forty years since the genre-defining comic book crossover event “Crisis on Infinite Earths” erased their home planet Earth-2, itself largely a creation designed to differentiate older Golden Age heroes from their more modern Silver Age counterparts, was the way that the team came together to fight the good fight even as the world had largely passed them by. There’s something inherently relatable in watching more obscure, less powerful heroes battle back the tides of time and their own declining relevance. Ironically, given the frantic explosion-laden extravaganza that defines Black Adam’s attempt at a narrative, the JSA represented a quieter time for superhero storytelling. Superhero filmmaking has come to embrace the obscure, making household names of characters such as the Peacemaker or the Guardians of the Galaxy that few people outside of diehard comic fans would have heard of just ten years ago. Characters like Black Adam and the JSA don’t completely fit under this bill, having achieved mainstream success back in the 1940s, but the idea that Shazam/Captain Marvel’s archnemesis’ live-action debut would come through a solo effort lacking Billy Batson entirely is still a bit hard to believe. The champion of Kahndaq has straddled the lines between villain and antihero for years, a fascinating, sly figure ripe for the greying morality of the post-9/11 era. Dwayne Johnson has largely avoided villain-type roles throughout his career. His approach to Black Adam displays a puzzling amount of apprehension toward playing an antihero as well. The Kahndaq that Teth-Adam is awakened into is occupied by a force called the Intergang, which the film essentially presents as a Blackwater-type oppressive military force with an ill-defined mandate in the complex geopolitics of the Middle East. Leaning heavily into antipathy, Johnson’s best effort to sell Adam’s reluctance to rid the Intergang with a snap of the finger is the fact that he’s been asleep too long to care anymore, a lazy excuse indicative of Black Adam’s larger shortcomings as a film. Black Adam squanders the DCEU’s meatiest moral quandary with an atrocious script hellbent on saying absolutely nothing interesting about its narrative or stacked roster of characters. It’s quite astonishing how boring this movie really is. Johnson’s wooden performance is largely a hodgepodge of the Guardians of the Galaxy’s Drax the Destroyer mixed with T2-era Terminator, a god with too much power that sucks the soul out of his film. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has no idea how to balance the film’s large cast of characters. The rapport between the JSA is established at breakneck speed, veterans Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) and Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan) are joined by newcomers Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), an awkward team dynamic, especially in a movie serving as an origin story to a completely different character. Black Adam spends much of the film alongside his liberators, Adrianna (Sarah Shahi), her son Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), and brother Karim (Mohammed Amer), a bloated collection of protagonists that leaves little room for the film’s breathtakingly underwhelming villain. The humor in the film is largely a derivative mess, Johnson stumbling over his badly written lines whenever he tries to crack a joke. Brosnan is the only actor present with an understanding of the comedy he’s expected to deliver. Hodge delivers the best performance of the film, working quite well off Johnson and Brosnan, though the film suffers from its emotional overreliance on Carter Hall in a narrative that’s supposed to be Black Adam’s moment to shine. The decent CGI is rendered moot by the lifeless fight choreography, a further waste of Johnson’s immense talents as one of the most dynamic performers in the history of professional wrestling. The politics of Kahndaq are the film’s biggest failing. The narrative comes close to hinting that it wants to take a side against America’s propagation of the military-industrial complex, a game of footsie that it never follows through on. Further puzzling the situation is the presence of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), whose efforts in service to the exact same cause were scrutinized in last year’s The Suicide Squad. There is not much difference between Waller’s antics in that movie and the Intergang here, not that anyone working at DC appears to notice or care. After years of Zack Snyder’s Ayn Rand ramblings soiling the DCEU, it’s a little disheartening to see such a waffling from a film that clearly understands its lead’s anti-imperialist ethos. Black Adam is a disheartening failure for the DCEU. Johnson embodies the awe and wonder Black Adam evokes, but he doesn’t do any interesting with his subject. There’s nothing at the core of this film besides tropes and plot holes, a predictable third act that unravels the film’s earlier tight pacing. The JSA is brought to life with obvious love, though clearly established with the intention of setting up their own spinoff down the road. It’s a sad kind of train wreck to watch. Words are easy things to write. We shouldn’t live in a world where expensive blockbusters are completely undone by atrocious screenplays. Black Adam has plenty of talent and first-rate special effects, neither of which can cover up just how bad this screenplay truly is. The studio executives should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this easy layup to go completely off the rails. “Words are easy things to write. ” A charming denigration of your craft, and, to an extent, I agree with you. Alas, stories aren’t easy to tell, apparently. I will still see this movie, if only for a break from the plethora of movies peddling on-the-nose messages as storytelling. Maybe such sentiment accounts for the vast gulf between critical and popular opinion on this one. What do you think? P.S. I like your style.
