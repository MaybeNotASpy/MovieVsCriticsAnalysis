Apr 14 2024,negative,bad animation weird and meaningless script
Apr 14 2024,positive,fun cute thoughtful nostalgic and timely
Apr 14 2024,negative,my best friend and i both 19yearold avid writers watched this movie together we both collectively agreed that the story and animation were horrible  starting with the story its bland and hard to follow we had trouble understanding it as adults there were too many unnecessary characters to keep track of and the main character asha is your average disney princess character from circa 2015 she was shallow with no personality traits that really differentiates her from any of the other princesses  the story really did feel ai generated and while it did have potential it was executed badly  even the songs were nothing to write home about  lastly the animation felt unfinished it seemed as if they were going for something similar to the style of the spiderverse movies yet failed miserably my best friend who makes a living as an artist was not impressed with it in the slightest and neither was i     tldr this film is unoriginal and yawn inducing we need something new from disney
Apr 13 2024,negative,movies animation was wacky but the plot was rushed they tried to cram too much in with too little time villain goes from 1 to 200 in five seconds plot jumps from one point to the next if possible i would like to bleach my eyeballs
Apr 13 2024,negative,magnifico is the hero of the film magnifico built the kingdom gave people homes and granted his people magic wishes to their safe wishes not all people are good and some have bad intentions therefore magnifico filters out the bad peoples wishes this movie demands the audience to be ungrateful for leadership and the help people give you and it reminds us all to always stay ungrateful it is only a matter of time before asha is put in the same situation and everyone dislikes her for having all the power
Apr 13 2024,negative,incredibly bland broken and offensive as a celebration of the art of disney the real negative highlight at show are the unintelligible and insipid songs that add absolutely nothing to the story and are just begging to be used out of context for some ambiguous reason look at the worst offenders youre a star at all costs this wish and this is the thanks i get thats nearly all of the songs the main character is extremely unlikeable the villain flipflops between misunderstood and comically douchey and the storypacing are broken beyond repair seeing the behindthescenes promotional material to this film hurts
Apr 13 2024,positive,i avoided watching this because i heard it was bad but found myself loving it when i finally did watch it no the music isnt what you hear in traditional disney movies but that doesnt make it bad  just different people need to also keep in mind that this is a kids movie your nostalgia for old disney is because you watched it as a kid youre not going to have those same feelings for kids movies youre seeing for the first time as an adult i enjoyed all the disney easter eggs and think that overall it was a creative and thoughtful way to honor the 100year disney legacy
Apr 13 2024,negative,amazing animation the story was not written by humans the songs suck and the moral is if anyone holds you down kill them including government officials everyone must be equal and all be happy down with capitalism up with communism this movie teaches kids the good morals of starting a rebellion and replacing a monarchy with communism in the end the conflict isnt resolved one person still decides what wishes get granted stay clear
Apr 13 2024,negative,the movie from the beginning was too rushed to show whos the bad guy this movie lacks originality it seemed to me like a mix of many different old disney movies combined into one
Apr 13 2024,neutral,i thought it was decent there were some slightly cheesy parts and it wasnt anything that stood out to me but it was entertaining enough for me to want to watch it in its entirety
Apr 12 2024,negative,this movie is genuinely so arse i dont think ive ever seen such garbage in my entire life and i work for a garbage disposal company if this movie was a fire id have a never ending bucket of water i honestly would rather put myself through saw movie traps than watch this absolute dog water movie i had to make an account just to post this review thats how terrible this dang movie is i think chess has a more interesting storyline than wish id rather watch a presidential debate which has better plot twists unforgivable
Apr 12 2024,positive,this movie remember the best face of disney its a clear face of modern films great job for all the family
Apr 12 2024,negative,the writting is so bad that the writters dont even know who the villain should be    the king is not wrong in the movie giving everyone always what they want is a bad thing  he keeps giving and giving without getting and that pushed his limits
Apr 12 2024,positive,like frozen but villain stealing everyones spirt 
Apr 12 2024,negative,watchable and decently entertaining although the story and songwriting are terrible its ok for kids i think
Apr 12 2024,negative,it seemed interesting but once the kid walked out we turned it off this one didnt land with the kiddos and hasnt been view since total letdown
Apr 11 2024,negative,the star is cute the goat is funny the songs arent great or memorable neither are the characters which suffered greatly from a lack of development lots of plot holes forced dialog awkward song lyrics lack of backstory and too much of a focus on cramming in easter eggs frozen 12 and encanto get regular replays in our house and their soundtracks are on repeat in the car cant say the same for wish
Apr 11 2024,negative,animation acting and singing isnt bad and it might be fin for very young kids but the story it self and characters failed very hard for me    it was very fast pace and it felt like things just happened out of nowhere some of the many issues is the main characters reasons to go against the king it seemed more like a teenager being upset that she didnt get her way because these issues seems to be centered around how this effects her not anymore else also she seems to flip back and fourth from wanting to save her grandfathers wish to wanting to save everyones wishes then back to just her grandfathers then back again    we also get very little reason to think the king is evil or doing anything wrong until he just decides to be evil just because people were asking questions   it felt very out of nowhere especially since none of their questions were negative at all if anything it just seem like similar to the main character he threw a tantrum    we are also given so little information on his back story even though it was very vaguely hinted through bits of the film felt like they build it up for no pay off in the end    for the songs they were also pretty forgettable to me and some didnt seem to fit the scene or context of the moment    overall the film is a mess it felt very incomplete sadly not something i expected to see for disneys 100 anniversary
Apr 11 2024,neutral,i loved the visuals animation references and music but i think the story writing isnt great i would like a disney movie that isnt afraid to have the princessmain character fall in love with a prince as well as a more thought out and memorable characters  im not good at words but i am just feeling disappointed i loved movies like rapunzel princess and the frog and mulan as a kid even though love wasnt the main part of the story and the disney princesses didnt even consider the princes to begin with it did make the character growth shine in these movies and make me want to watch them over and over again love really does shine  wish feels just lackluster compared to these movies
Apr 10 2024,negative,if youre looking for the definition of boring well this is it i wanted to give this movie a chance because of how awfully people rated and thought id like but i played this movie at least 4 times and couldnt finish it because i fell asleep on it plot is bland music is plain wish is just straight up garbage
Apr 10 2024,negative,terrible story visually pleasing but empty headed nonsense trash of a storyline with mediocre music promotes ideals of theft over communication and disloyalty over compromise and understanding good stories teach you valuable lessons about the world and humanity at least thats what disney used to stand for once upon a time
Apr 10 2024,positive,nothing exceptional but wish remains completely watchable the little star is adorable the villain is a little bit more nuanced than what you usually see he gets corrupted and is not dangerous since the beginning otherwise its pretty average but better than what the critics said of it a pretty good moment to spend although you wont keep an undying memory of it
Apr 9 2024,negative,i usually yell at my family to shut up when a movie is on but sorry disney i really didnt care when this movie was on and disapointed that alan tudyk was in this he was on so much better stuff that was worth watching
Apr 9 2024,positive,fantastic soundtrack and animation thats let down by a story thats just a bit too busy and fails to adequately address the complications of the themes that it brings up
Apr 9 2024,positive,disneys wish was refreshing humans have relied on some type of organized religion for eons this movie gives us a chance to think about selfreliance and not banking on an individual to save us it speaks of how we are all connected and how there is a power to working together the animation is gorgeous the characters are believable and the songs are lovely
Apr 9 2024,negative,what a weird confusing movie with exceptionally good graphics and exceptionally bad pacing and horrible song lyrics who the hell writes and throw caution to every warning sign and thinks thats a good lyric the songs have the same amount of soul as ai generated things do none of the songs were actually about anything it was amazing
Apr 9 2024,positive,this is an incredible movie fantastic music with a traditional plot and great characters that tell a traditional feeling story a great way to celebrate 100 years of wonder
Apr 9 2024,neutral,wish was a wasted opportunity for disney more notable as an example the slump that the house of mouse is trapped in than as a celebration of its centennial   the movie seemed more interested in fan service and callbacks than telling a compelling story or creating interesting characters and the movie felt flat lifeless and largely forgettable
Apr 9 2024,negative,very sad that disney characters only represent the villains journey im correct righteous smarter and know more than others i simply need to convince them that i am right so that i can step into my power the main character felt like the reap villain of the story
Apr 9 2024,negative,terrible voice acting for the animals awful politicized writing  main character has no personality or depth honestly i remember her hair animation but not her name thats how transparent she is
Apr 9 2024,positive,honestly its not a bad movie the songs are catchy and the characters are pretty well written
Apr 8 2024,negative,disney has lost touch in its story lines and now just focuses on things that their fan base arent as drawn to that the writers value more than good writing  do better writers
Apr 8 2024,negative,this was the worst disneypixar movie ive ever seen where was the person in the story trust who could have called out the annoying cliches it even starts with a once upon the time disney you need a better critic on your staff this one should have been scrapped
Apr 8 2024,positive,this is the sweetest film and i love the nod to picture books of the past the animation is breathtakingly nostalgic the villain is so great the magic the wonder the friendship the family this is why we go to the movies the critics were wrong
Apr 8 2024,positive,wow this is one of the disney films that i had low expectations on but after watching it myself i actually find it to be a good film does it have issues yes but that doesnt stop it being enjoyable wish is a solid movie with a decent story some breathtaking animation and likeable characters a decent tribute to walt disneys legacy this is what i highly recommend to anyone who wants their wish granted just be careful what you wish for
Apr 8 2024,negative,i turned it off after 30 min its slow and silly  i guess ill watch meet the robison or zootropolis  disney doesnt make movies good anymore    i miss good family movies like robots and anything tim burton created   i have no desire to return to disney movies  if i did not receive disney for free id cancel
Apr 8 2024,negative,i will never see this
Apr 8 2024,positive,wish sets out to celebrate disneys illustrious 100 years of movie magic but unfortunately its more of a flicker than a dazzling display ashas wish on a star brings her an unexpected companion a mischievous star that adds chaos to her life while the premise holds promise the execution falls short of capturing disneys quintessential heart and soul    the songs though passable lack the infectious catchiness that disney classics are known for everything feels a bit flat lacking the depth and magic synonymous with the house of mouse however the film redeems itself with a plethora of delightful easter eggs and nods to disneys rich cinematic history    the plot follows a predictable trajectory with a straightforward and generic storyline yet its not without its charms including a classic villain whose antics add a touch of nostalgia    despite its shortcomings wish manages to entertain albeit fleetingly it teeters on the edge of greatness but ultimately falls short due to its inability to fully immerse viewers in the enchanting world of disney    while it may not reach the lofty heights of disneys most beloved films wish still offers a modicum of enjoyment and for those who stick around for the postcredit scene prepare for a heartfelt moment that may just bring a tear to your eye
Apr 8 2024,negative,nothing special animation storyline songs all feel like an intern project it reminds me of straight to home video low budget movies got bored 20 minutes into movie then it felt forced to finish the movie huge miss by disney
Apr 8 2024,negative,may contain minor spoilers the artwork was good and i have to say disney was brave with the choice of antagonist but not only that but also letting the antagonist win brave stupid but brave    to be honest so was the story quite bad and the songs not memorable at all we get the image of a safe and prosperous country that apparently has little to no taxes a king who fulfills around 12 wishes a year and people still complain because everyone dont get everything they want this entire movie starts and is driver fully by greed and narcissism the people i mainly like in this movie are those we are not supposed to like and i cant get over the smug and condescending attitude of the loyal queen when she realised she could get rid of her husband and get the throne all to herself and the main character our antagonist asha gets fully rewarded even tho everything bad that happens is completely because of her    there are so much more that could be said but to end before this go on too long this is one of if not the worst disney movie i have seen
Apr 8 2024,positive,a good movie but lacking the extra magic of moana or frozen  odd for me to say but a bit too much singing
Apr 8 2024,positive,this film wants tomatos cause it got tomatos
Apr 8 2024,negative,fmc was very visibly a mix of rapunzel moana and mirabel the songs were not catching the ending was just stupid huge disappointment
Apr 8 2024,neutral,it is not the best disney movie nor is it the worst but it does entertain for a while the song this wish is one of the best and what i liked it is not the movie that i would remember 100 years of disney but not bad
Apr 8 2024,negative,this movie was garbage its story was just about a town of ungrateful people never getting enough and being rude to the king who grants them wishes and makes sure the kingdom is peaceful but since he doesnt give everyone what they want all the time they all hate him theres no character development or arch the moral of the story is if your not getting what you want throw a fit and tantrum about it
Apr 8 2024,negative,i would rather write a review on this censored website than stay in anyway silent on how bad boring and honestly horrible this god awful career ending chat gpt vomited boring tone deaf awful movie just ask chat gpt to write you a movie and boom go lie and say you had a soul or enough creativity to pretend to be human
Apr 8 2024,positive,not perfect and lacking the creativity of past classics but still better than much of the current rehashed nonsense available from disney the company has been resting on its laurels for far too long and they need to bring out more of that old time quality originality this is at least a small step in the right direction instead of all the sequels and remakes they need to get their heads back in gear and even though its rather meager at least this is an attempt though the story is convoluted and a slightly weak outing im proud of disney for sticking their neck out for a change instead of relying on regenerated glop
Apr 8 2024,positive,wish was released last year and fell victim to terrible reviews and a busy holiday slate of movies i admit the word of mouth even had me questioning if i wanted to see it well now that we are about to watch this film for the third time i can safely say that it gets a bad rap     wish is a very charming beautifully animated story with catchy songs and fantastic characters it has everything youd want in a classic disney movie and leans heavily on easter eggs and nostalgia now some people might find that lazy tugging at our memories from the past that made us enjoy the long slate of disney magic to draw us into something new but everything happens organically throughout the film i loved every second of it actually my second watch made me appreciate it even more     the other thing that ive heard is that the music wasnt very good and that its too confusing i must have a different idea of what makes a song good beacuse these tunes are solid welcome to rosas is ear wormy material for sure and this wish is obviously going to become a staple on our disney adventure playlist along with youre a star which is littered with so many throwbacks its ridiculous and chris pine is perfect in his villain song this is the thanks i get     speaking of which my favorite part of the whole movie is magnifico his plight throughout makes him stand out hes just well magnificent now that could be because i love pretty much every movie chris pine is in but i believe he plays a great villain through and through the star is very cute valentino is hilarious but magnifico in my opinion is the king of this movie also hes tied to possibly the greatest blink and youll miss it easter egg ive ever seen it makes his whole character on another level and made me root for a disney villain for the first time since scar also a king and scar was right haha    so again im sure youve heard bad things about wish but i think they are unwarranted i highly recommend it great movie great songs great characters and worthy of multiple watches
Apr 8 2024,positive,my daughter loves it we have been watching it over and over doesnt have the best reviews but if you give it a chance you will really start to enjoy it soundtrack is a1  everyone did a great job my daughters favorite part is when the chickens do their dance very fun for the kids thats all you can ask for
Apr 7 2024,positive,absolutely wonderful movie if you are a long time disney lover than this movie is for you
Apr 7 2024,positive,subble in many ways you need to be able to read between the lines to enjoy this latest disney masterpiece
Apr 7 2024,negative,maybe the worst disney movie ive seen the graphics are the 2nd best part but the best was the credits the music is pretty awful and the characters are not interesting the king could have been good but by the end of the movie he is just evil with no motivation that kind of worked with some old disney movies but its not like hes trying to get to power like ursula jafar or hans hes already in power the only decent song is the this wish but the lyrics are so cringe like dont you think youre the prob im gonna vent when things go wrong come on disney you can be better
Apr 7 2024,negative,bland flat nostalgia milking substance less trash
Apr 7 2024,negative,disney tried to put in too many dynamics characters and too many references to other movies it didnt appeal to a large audience its the kind of movie that you enjoy when youre young and hate when you grow up the songwriting was low quality it lacks the true disney magic of appealing to children and adults alike
Apr 7 2024,negative,doesnt have any effort put into it with lazy writing boring and predictable story and horrible animation disney really wanted this to be a love letter but it didnt pay off im very disappointed
Apr 7 2024,positive,a beautiful mix of disney past and present with stunning animation and soundtrack with apart from villain immensely lovable characters
Apr 7 2024,negative,another poorly written story from disney do yourself a favor and pass on this waste of time
Apr 7 2024,positive,i loved this movie especially on a second watch having not read any reviews on it i watched it completely unbiased and nearly switched it off in the first sequence this wasnt because i didnt like the music but simply because the animation was so jarring had i read up i on i would have realised i was watching a celebration of one hundred years of styles that said i persevered and was hooked by the beautiful song at all costs between asha and magnifico and completely bought in to it as soon as star appeared from then on i absolutely loved this film its clever nostalgic traditional yet modern themes all rolled in to one next day i booked tickets to see it in the cinema and watched it again it was even better  for me this was childhood disney magic which i havent felt with some of the latest movies for older disney fans this is a must the younger audience in the cinema laughed and even clapped at the end of one song too well done disney
Apr 7 2024,negative,terrible worst disney movie i have ever started to watch watched finding nemo and then disney suggested wish this movie is unwatchable and i wish i could give this movie 5 stars
Apr 7 2024,negative,unimaginative and feels really flat is this really the best disney can give to celebrate their 100 years anniversary there is no passion there and coming from a big disney fan i dont feel like i got a product that is on the quality standard of their artistic level they can achieve so much more when they give their best efforts it seems that nobody cared during the production process even the music was dull
Apr 7 2024,negative,it felt unfinished not enough back story motivation or fleshing out of the characters the songs all sounded bland and out of place overall very lackluster
Apr 7 2024,positive,absolutely charming story with beautiful songs and quirky characters plenty of easter eggs referencing disney magic of the past 100 years to make it engaging and a sweet message for of holding on to your dreams and having it up to you to amie your dreams come true
Apr 7 2024,positive,it was a pretty good movie
Apr 7 2024,negative,just dreadful horrible script awful music cheap graphics and no character development how did this even get made 
Apr 7 2024,negative,i think the movie is not even close to disneys quality story line is cheesy songs lyrics are nonsense and forgettable just like the characters i think asking ai to write this would have been a lot better
Apr 6 2024,negative,the characters are lackluster the story is boring and the songs are as lively as mud and totally forgettable while not totally horrible this is far far far from disneys best efforts
Apr 6 2024,positive,this is going to be long lets see what happen to this movie is like the opposite thing that happened to spiderman into the spiderverse movie that movie was in the firsts ones with that kind of animation many maybe didnt know what to think but were with some hope and then many loved it this movie wish the thing that went wrong was the weight over it many were very illusionated with this because was the movie for the 100 years of disney their first movie with this animationwhich is like a lie disney already haved a short film call paperman who has this animation and it was liked this movie has the nostalgic thing in many things and also in the script because think it snowwhite cinderella were like a little silly in their script but without the weight they were loved you can see it that way this is my opinion alright but i think this movie is going to be a little cult sometime also i wanna add that the songs are very enjoyable with the ariana debose voice are very good
Apr 6 2024,negative,i think it was like written by ai
Apr 6 2024,negative,are they sure this isnt ai it feels like ai was told to write a disney   i mean it the story comes off as written by ai nothing makes sense and the characters just do things or say things like no human would the songs are nonsense and very hard to follow my partner and i found ourselves zoning out when they where singing its that bad oh and they sing a lot even for a disney film its a lot of songs the bast thing about this movie is the colours of the art and seems how much it got dragged online for looking ai i dont think its much of a plus
Apr 6 2024,positive,my family and i saw wish in the theaters when it was first released and really enjoyed itnow that its on disney we are loving it all over again the songs are wonderful the animation is beautiful and the original storyline is cute  and i especially love all the nods to the 100 years of disney classics
Apr 6 2024,positive,very lovely art work the animations characters and world are interesting would recommend
Apr 6 2024,positive,i thought the plot was a little loose songs are decent cute plot a good movie but nothing exceptional
Apr 6 2024,negative,this movie fell flat extremely disappointed to see this is what disney came up with for their 100th anniversary celebration animation felt cheap and similar to watching  cocomelon the defense ive heard regarding the terrible animation is they wanted to pay homage to older 2d but why not just make the whole movie hand drawn 2d it just ends up looking lazy there was no real character development i found myself most of the time not rooting for or against any particular character songs were meh just more percussion based songs that just make me feel like im listening to current pop instead of beautifully orchestrated pieces heard in almost every disney movie out there the plot was questionable the whole time still have no clue as to why the wishes felt so important that the king had to hold onto them or why people felt grief once their wish was gone its like the writers went out of their way to not explain anything youd think at the end when the king harnesses all the wishes that hed have jafar from aladdin type powers but in reality can only create a sandstorm type pulse that would fail to knock down my three year old overall this movie felt like an ai request if you asked it to make a disney movie with a lin manuel miranda type soundtrack hope disney can come up with something better their next go around smh also i created an rt account just so i can review this one movie buyer beware
Apr 6 2024,positive,first off let me just start off by saying that the movie looked absolutely stunning the animation style was beautiful blending 2d animation with 3d animation that being said lets get into the meat and potatoes of this movie after watching this movie i felt the villain king magnifico wasnt actually a villain  he just wanted to do what was best for the kingdom that he literally built from the ground up this movie wouldve been better if it turned out asha was the true villain instead of making her a disney princess she is entitled and believes that all wishes should be granted regardless of consequences i may have been watching it through adult eyes but he wasnt being unreasonable
Apr 6 2024,positive,i think the movie was great and it shows that greed can become a powerful thing and it shows that we can always make our dreams or wishes come truethe songs are so empowering i could listen to what we know now over and over again
Apr 6 2024,neutral,i loved the concept of the movie its just the graphics and the way it looked made me want to stop watching it all the other disney movies and the older ones had better design and graphics this one just looked meh the story also had barely any story the concept was there just felt rushed and no story no background nothing to make me feel happy joy sadness and fulfilled as the other movies they made
Apr 6 2024,negative,this movie is absolutely terrible i can overlook many things i didnt like about the movie if the story was actually wellwritten but it wasnt theres no explanation for anything things just happen and youre just supposed to sit there and accept it why was the king taking wishes he doesnt know why does he grant wishes he doesnt know that either why do people forget their wishes not explained why do people feel grief when their wishes are destroyed not explained why did the main character want to become an apprentice no idea why do the animals know so much about the star animal intuition did the star actually do anything no nothing why was the king threatened by the star no idea     i could not connect to anybody in the movie so no moment was actually impactful at an emotional level too many songs that didnt explain anything or felt as if it didnt fit into the moment happening in the movie     im disappointed because there were so many opportunities for this movie to be incredibly impactful and have deep emotional moments but it was seemingly never considered for example they only had to do one thing in the movie to leave the audience feeling moved play when you wish upon a star at the end of the movie that would have been its redeeming quality but no  what a waste
Apr 6 2024,positive,its not a smash hit but its a good film having disney go back to its roots in making friendly fairy tale films
Apr 6 2024,negative,good for a few chuckles but fails to deliver what youd expect from a disney production over does it on the songs that are all forgettable but provides the audience with a unique mixture of 2d  and 3d artistry
Apr 6 2024,negative,if you are looking for disney magic look elsewhere forgettable characters bad story meh animation a shame of a movie specially since its celebrating 100 years of disney
Apr 6 2024,positive,as an avid disney fan not all movies under their umbrella hit the heart string like this one and heres why   i purposefully didnt want to know anything about it when i started catching easter eggs to other disney movies it finally clicked this is a disney origin story ill leave out the spoilers but this was a beautifully made movie with elements that reminded me of the classics outstanding music and an ending that gave me the chills this is the perfect 100 year anniversary movie to the history of disney and we all loved it
Apr 6 2024,negative,the music was entertaining the lack of true villain was the biggest flaw of the movie
Apr 6 2024,negative,disney is just a little off their game these days this movie is another overlycomplex and philosophical movie for kids and its a bit dark i just dont know who this movie was for but miss the superior storytelling and adventure of older disney animated movies
Apr 6 2024,negative,the music was just awful
Apr 6 2024,negative,absolutely terrible        the animation was hard to watch the main character is a complete mess the movie is all over the placeunsure of what its plot is and the stated message of the film is that our wishes represent who we are and that we should do the right thing even when its difficult however throughout the movie what it actually touts is that life isnt fair and most people arent willing to try to achieve their dreamsthe negative connotation         ive never felt the need to write a bad review before on any book movie or item ive purchased but i believe that this movie could very negatively affect young audiences and overall is just mediocre in its plot soundtrack and animation    zero stars
Apr 6 2024,negative,wow 20 minutes deep and we turned it off  the songs were horrible the characters bland the story was ridiculous and it didnt feel like i was watching a disney movie  there was no emotional connection at all  sad to see disney has lost their mojo
Apr 5 2024,positive,absolutely loved it so cute colourful and a great message the songssinging are amazing and put a modern pop twist on the classic disney musical so many fun easter eggs for disney movie fans too definitely a must watch the story is simple but lovely dont miss the postcredits scene
Apr 5 2024,positive,deserves a better score than its current creative plot
Apr 5 2024,negative,the writing is so lazy it hurts the talwnted voicecast is wasted on the generic characters and songs the animation looks clumsy at best shame that one of the very few original movies in the endless sequel parade disney has done in the last decade cant live up to any of the classics its supposed to celebrate new low point
Apr 5 2024,negative,too dark not a good message for kids also just not a good story which is said because the main characters and side characters were fun
Apr 5 2024,negative,boring storyline songs are meh missing genuine humour i was bored as where kids
Apr 5 2024,negative,hell no this is worst than a musical hell no avoid it if you can cant even imagine small kids liking this
Apr 5 2024,positive,an absolute pleasure from the beginning to the end it was wonderfully animated and original a true masterpiece for the house of mouse
Apr 5 2024,negative,i really really wanted to like this movie the voice acting was good the animation was a bit strange but i didnt mind it what bothered me was the storyplot like many others have pointed out the audience feels very rushed through the story there are points that are never explained or expanded upon where did this evil book come from what happened to the tapestry in the kings chambers we are shown this half burnt tapestry of his family and in my mind im like oh there is going to be some story about this later nope nothing about why its burnt whose his family was etc its all rushed either expand on things you showcase or dont show them im not sure im just used to disneys storylines and pacing i dunno it was disappointing and nothing that im going to remember or have any songs stuck in my head   i feel like it could have been so much more and much better with more time more fleshing out of the story etc
Apr 5 2024,negative,this movie its just plainly bad the music is mediocre especially for a disney movie the story is flat and predictible and it just feels like forced writing trying to put as many references in their even if they dont fit its just astonishing that this comes from the same studio as encanto and even more that this is their 100 year celebration title    they will try to milk it but i think it will be forgotten quite soon
Apr 5 2024,negative,without personality and with a plot wholly predictable oh no the guy in power is actually the big bad guy lets heal everything with the power of friendship like seriously im sure there are people out there that can think of a better storyline also an incredibly short film at that and the art of the film itself looked unfinished blurry and incoherent at times the art style kind of reminds me of some games cutscenes for some reason from such a big company and this film being for said company anniversary im very disappointed to say the least
Apr 5 2024,positive,i have mixed feelings i wanted it to be good so my score might already be a bit biased the story is shallow lacking depth and is quite plain the editing is weird too  the story progresses very quickly and i felt forced to connect with the movie the main characters motivation isnt strong enough and it wasnt emphasized much the villain is very basic now for the good parts some of the songs are pretty good the animation is beautiful and a bit strange in a good way and the star is really cute
Apr 5 2024,positive,the music is elite they basically took lin manuel mirandas formula for writing and copied it the story is fun the characters are likable the ending was well foreshadowed and satisfying it celebrates the 100 yes of disney wonderfully the after credits scene was a gem i missed it the first several times watching it my kids love it they really needed to include the after credits scene earlier so everyone sees it it ties the whole movie together even better
Apr 5 2024,negative,i dont even know what to say anymore this is entire movie is just disappointing all the way through i had high hopes you would be more successful making more movies on little mermaid than anything
Apr 5 2024,negative,visually interesting but every other aspect of the film is awful the villain is one dimensional his animation and movement is weirdly comical very obvious story twist gods i really hated this movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,i thought this was a wonderful movie left my heart full like the classic disney movies 3
Apr 5 2024,negative,super dissapointed in the fall of story quality since moana the characters dialog were terrible and the only lovable person was the villan the only scenes i genuinely enjoyed were the couple featuring olddisney styled forest creatures
Apr 5 2024,negative,if i could have i would have given it a zero takes too long to get investedslow start visually boring animation seemed unfinished the plot pacing feels off very dark themes of magic horoscope and witchcraft songs felt lazy and unimaginative it took so much energy to make myself pay attention while watching
Apr 4 2024,positive,it was masterpiece beautiful animatian and great characters ashas a great new disney princess and king magnifico is a great new villain
Apr 4 2024,positive,the story and characters were enjoyable i feel like this could have done well without being a musical this way there could be more details and exploring in the story side of the film as some songs just werent needed in my opinion
Apr 4 2024,positive,we all need to remember who disney movies are made for my children loved it i enjoyed the nostalgic elements to the film and thought it celebrated disney well with enough throw back references to keep the real disney nerds excited some of the songs were great but one or two seemed misplaced i think the protagonist was great  strong willed with good intentions but learned along the way the villain was a true villain in the way you could see where he was coming from but he took it too far due to vanity and lust for power overall dont look at what the critics say  if youre a child or a true fan of disney you will enjoy this
Apr 4 2024,positive,i loved this movie the animation was beautiful the songs were fantastic and the story was adorable and funny i teared up a few times and we will definitely watch it again
Apr 4 2024,positive,maybe its not the strongest disney princess film but it means well as it is a gentle reminder of some of the best disney films of the past just as it was meant to be and im glad it brought us an actual villain again and not one of those plot twist villains no matter what anyone else thinks of the character
Apr 4 2024,negative,for disney traditionally being known for making unique stories wish was not one of them the main issue with wish is that it feels like a theater show you would watch in a disney park like mickey and the magical map you go to those shows because the park wants crowed control and the show doesnt need to be written well it more just has to look pretty enough for your kid to enjoy it while you can sit for an hour disney animated movies at least traditionally have not done this the movies have more been engaging for adults and kids so to see wish pull the theme park writing and pacing is disappointing and frustrating
Apr 4 2024,positive,this movie offers a compelling storyline that prompts viewers to contemplate societal and spiritual strength it goes beyond the typical disney romance and is both an entertaining and thoughtprovoking experience im eager to see where disney takes its storytelling in the future
Apr 4 2024,positive,the entire family loved this movie great music funny characters and its a cute story
Apr 4 2024,negative,i am so unbelievably disappointed in not only this movie but this company i thought this movie could not be as bad as everyone has been saying but i was wrong a villain who is morally good and a protagonist who is selfish naive and onedimensional the music is disgustingly written and forgettable with a horrid message for an 100th anniversary special this feels more like a poorly written retirement special truely the death of disney 
Apr 4 2024,negative,while the idea of the wishes is great it was executed very poorly i dont understand what the king main villain of the movie did wrong exactly except for getting a bit too angry for a pretty valid reason his citizens are happy are they not wishes get granted pretty often i would have loved it if the movie had someone threaten the reign of the great king and asha has to save him or something
Apr 4 2024,positive,unreal songs beautiful animation old school disney storyline with the magic and escapism that disney classics offer really loved it
Apr 4 2024,positive,beautiful movie providing the older audience a touch of our childhood throughout the entire movie highly highly recommend
Apr 4 2024,negative,honestly this movie is so bad that i dont even feel like it deserves a rating the songs are bland the story feels like it was written by chat gbt and overall its just a really bad movie a mockery really to the classics i do honestly believe that disney is in its flop era
Apr 4 2024,positive,different kind of art style   my daughter seemed to enjoy it as we watched it twice in a row
Apr 3 2024,negative,trite uninspired storyline bizarre animation styling
Apr 3 2024,negative,the plot isnt that great and it could just as well be written by ai but the end credits are a great honoring of all past disney classics
Apr 3 2024,negative,i couldnt even finish the whole thing i had heard barely anything about the movie and i guess there was good reason for that every aspect of the movie was poorly done the songs the character design and development the plot really not worth the time to watch
Apr 3 2024,positive,my two 4 year old granddaughters loved this movie and have watched it more than once thats all that matters
Apr 3 2024,positive,a very heartfelt disney film despite having a poorly art style and the plot needing more work its still very entertaining and nostalgic not deserving of all the hate it got
Apr 3 2024,negative,a hollow forgettable movie that spends most of its time shallowly referencing disneys past much better works
Apr 3 2024,negative,asha comes off pretty entitled it felt like it was written by those chronically online people who lack critical thinking skills and want all their feelings and emotions validated  plus the songs werent very good
Apr 3 2024,negative,the story was okay but lacked depth the villain seems contradictory in that he seemed to care and want his kingdom to thrive but was also immensely selfish the songs were forgettable the dancing chickens were unnecessary in every way after encanto this is just disappointing
Apr 3 2024,negative,i got 3 quarters of the way through and turned it off i couldnt sit through another second of this trash they basically took anna from frozen and made her a different ethnicity she has every one of annas characteristics the side characters are lame the goat is a weak sidekick the villain was  easily the lamest villain ever
Apr 3 2024,positive,the expert critics judged this one harshly they just lost the magicnostalgia of being a kid these movies are made for kids not for adults my kids loved it and now that its in d we have watched it on repeat because thats what kids do
Apr 3 2024,negative,story line was good but songs were no where near up to disney standards and animation was poorly designed looks unfinished rushed or from 50 years ago
Apr 3 2024,negative,really wanted to like this movie as its the first new animated one from disney in a while but its just not good
Apr 2 2024,negative,songs were not good and very undisneylike the storyline and move in general were very dark and my two kids asked to leave midshow never a good sign
Apr 2 2024,negative,wish is the story of asha an entitled naive teenager who destroyed a kingdom
Apr 1 2024,negative,overall bland and not up to disney standard of animation song story felt like a rushed production and the animation felt like shrek 1
Mar 31 2024,neutral,the story of this movie felt ai generated
Mar 30 2024,positive,daughter loved this the little star character had so many cute expressions  
Mar 30 2024,negative,if you want a fun movie to watch with your kids this ones the right thing for you but if you want a movie that has interesting characters a good plot a good villain or villains and songs that are good then this movie isnt the right one for you also the fact that people liked trolls 3 more than this movie is absolutely hallarious but also concerning that the singing germlin movie was more liked than a disney film note before you get the last part of my review the wrong way and think i dont like trolls 3 i actually do
Mar 25 2024,negative,this movie is an atrocity it makes megamind 2 look like an oscar winner i would honestly rather watch megamind 2 and frozen over this terrible movie i would rather watch the sonic movie this movie deserves all the hate that it gets and it doesnt deserve any of the praises that it gets disney has done better than this this begs the questionwhy didnt disney make a kingdom hearts movie instead of this trash why didnt they why not a kingdom hearts movie would have been perfect for the 100th anniversary and an easy win for disney
Mar 25 2024,neutral,basic as hell to say planely disney has been fumbling the bag lately and this is no different i went on a date to see this because nothing else good was out at this point in 2023 and well it passed time ig it was weird i didnt like the mixed animation they were going for through the first half of this movie felt more like disney channel the second half however was way cooler the characters meant squat to me i honestly did not like any of them nor care about them the music was cringey plain and simple and with disney yeah its childish duh but it wasnt even childish or overly kiddy the music just sucked boring music for a mid movie however was not awful not the worst movie ive seen in theaters if anything may be on par with the worst ive seen in theaters it was just eh the villain was not scary to me or a big threat till the last 20 minutes and didnt like the protagonist meant nothing to me but spent time nothing more nothing less
Mar 24 2024,negative,disney is trying but without trying hard enough to mimic what masterpieces like into the spiderverse and puss in boots the last wish did they tried to imitate but watered down the much more vibrant and lively styles by animating some effects in 2d and slapping an awkward paper texture over it all it looks and feels very flat and out of place especially knowing the source materials and how so much better they are   as an animator who truly wanted to like this movie i cant bring myself to and i wont even delve into the disastrous writing of the characters and the nonsensical story  it wasnt particularly enjoyable still dont know why they hired pop song writers instead of musical ones   idk kids might like some visuals and the talking baby goat but disney what are you doing
Mar 24 2024,positive,meh not the best disney has to offer
Mar 24 2024,negative,wow what a flop again what were they thinking this is incredibly bring cliche uninteresting i can only imagine those overpaid noerd saying to each other this is going to be good and a nonbinary character wtf
Mar 23 2024,positive,the movies animation is a highlight with a unique style that blends classic and modern elements while charming the plot did not offer a lot of depth or complexity overall wish is a fun and visually appealing adventure for younger audiences offering a familiar disney experience
Mar 23 2024,negative,uninspired music lame villain stupid formulaic plot this is not encanto this is a train wreck that cant be saved wit a cute goat cracking oneliners
Mar 22 2024,positive,not really as bad as people say it is tho sure there were some problems but at the same time its a great movie
Mar 22 2024,negative,horrible just really horrible
Mar 22 2024,negative,a passionless project with no real stakes ai generated songs and an underwhelming plot
Mar 22 2024,negative,this movie made no sense and it was very corny
Mar 22 2024,negative,bad music bad characters bad plot and overall bad movie
Mar 17 2024,negative,the fuckest movie everrr i fucking hate it
Mar 16 2024,negative,king magnifico is the true hero base on the logic of this movie asha is the greedy villain
Mar 15 2024,positive,my daughters love these songs they keep singing them over and over  i personally love all of the references to so many other disney movies i also love that it has a wonderful message about uniting against oppression and reclaiming the power of the people and of course graphics and artwork are as beautiful as ever it will be a classic for our family
Mar 15 2024,positive,firstly why didnt they use 2d animation for their 100th anniversary secondly who cast this thirdly the songs are  forgettable i really wanted to like this i genuinely do not understand how their nod to their centenary was such a let down it coyld have been spectacular instead it was just meh the goat is the best character
Mar 14 2024,negative,the songs seemed they were originally written for something else  definitely seemed like a b team got together to write the movie to push something out while there was a writers  strike its pretty bad
Mar 12 2024,positive,being a disney fan my whole life i must say i was hesitant to watch this one for fear of being disappointed given all the negative things being said about it but  i was pleasantly surprised i thought it was a great movie all around i enjoyed the music and especially enjoyed the presence of a strong villain for the first time in a while the animation seemed to be lacking a little bit im getting burnt out on 3d animation however i was a big fan of wish
Mar 6 2024,positive,i think this movie was an amazing blend of lightheartedness and perfectly encapsulated the princess fairytale vibes with funny and story driving side kicks the story is so moving for the message disney carries about wishes and dreams and had the perfect amount of nods to disneys enriching history overall amazing film would definitely watch again
Mar 5 2024,negative,wish showcases a visually enchanting tapestry that captivates with its vibrant colors and imaginative animation however the films appeal falters in its accessibility for younger audiences as the intricate narrative proves challenging to follow despite the visual spectacle the plot lacks the necessary depth and intrigue leaving room for improvement through more skilled and imaginative storytelling a missed opportunity for a truly exceptional cinematic experience
Mar 5 2024,negative,just a nothing movie and i hate the goat so much he brings nothing to the plot whatsoever but at least the star is cute and has pretty animation
Mar 4 2024,positive,great movie but definitely not disneys best film the movie felt like it was rushed there wasnt as much story as encanto and the songs werent as catchy
Mar 3 2024,positive,it doesnt deserve any of the hate this film got it might not be among the studios best it still delivers with the heart music visualsdespite being a bit faulty and humor
Mar 3 2024,negative,this movie is awful  the animation is pretty thats it the villain of the movie isnt even really a villain at all until the main protagonist tries to steal all his stuff  this probably shouldnt have been made at all
Mar 2 2024,positive,our family loved this movie 47 and 9 year old kids we loved the combination of historical and modern animation techniques good songs storyacting my wife and kids will be watching this again and again
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is definitely a good snack the characters are awesome and funny while this story is so beautiful
Mar 2 2024,positive,funny and narratively simple the story is successful with the intention of making the film a warm reference to many of the studios classics as concluded by the critics consensus although the story has nothing new and can be easily predicted there are some elements that can hardly find in recent disney movies and can therefore offer some entertaining for example a villain that is a complete evil
Feb 29 2024,negative,not worth your money
Feb 29 2024,positive,its good not great and hampered by being more of an assignment than an organically occuring film of its own but they did fairly well considering those confines
Feb 29 2024,negative,is that movie made by ai the only good about this movie are the songs
Feb 29 2024,negative,the perfect depiction of disneys current state dull looks unfinished story and art but specially the story a heroine who almost doesnt change at all throughout the whole film she was always right a villain with a sudden and forced personality twist forgettable songs and characters disneys 100th anniversary ladies and gentlemen
Feb 29 2024,positive,bought wish on amazon prime video for 1299 on digital its on sale currently and we finally got to see it we were unable to see it in theaters before it left due to extenuating circumstances that arose multiple times during its theater run    it was an amazing film it had all the fun magic and pure storytelling that disney has been lacking in recent years it was reminiscent of the original disney we all know and loved for so many years which was refreshing compared to their recent lineup of films from the past few years     additionally the cast vocals were phenomenal every song was beautiful additions to the film to guided the story     this film has not gotten nearly as much love as it deserves its a  from myself and my family especially my six year old who loved it this film was the perfect tribute to the magic and wonder that walt disney created for all us 100 years ago
Feb 28 2024,neutral,disney ended 2023 with wish which fealt like a bit of a hail mary to get the studio back on track    synopsis a young girl named asha wishes on a star and gets a more direct answer than she bargained for when a troublemaking star comes down from the sky to join her    whats going on at disney at the moment is a major question from everyone within the industry although visually their product hasnt dropped in standard theres been massive issues story wise with most of their recent films they have been a mess and wish is a perfect example of this    whilst other studios are excelling and catching up to disney they themselves seem to be floundering    wish is a tribute to disneys history and a celebration of its 100th birthday many people have said this film links everything which has come before and although there are maybe hints to this overall thats not the case    as great as this film looks with its subtle twist on their animation style its the story where this film really falls down it feels like all the effort went into the visuals leaving behind a messy story for us to wade through    it feels lacking in emotion which is something youd never expect from a disney movie    its just not very good a massive disappointment    510
Feb 28 2024,negative,very generic movie not really worth the time
Feb 27 2024,negative,ai generator characters plot is a joke
Feb 26 2024,negative,bad movie characters music plot and the goat isnt funny
Feb 24 2024,negative,a disappointing movie for the disney centenary there arent any redeeming qualities from the generic main character to the forgettable side characters annoying sidekick villain that isnt really a villain and songs with uninspired lyrics it may look cute on the surface but just feels hollow
Feb 24 2024,negative,i think the watercolor art style was cute and was charming the characters and plot were all underdeveloped and sudden it feels like they cut out scenes and pasted in new ones without changing anything else to make sure the changes coherent story the story ended up felling like some parts didnt fit together or like parts necessary to understand the story were missing definitely a skip for me chris pine really tried hard to carry this movie unfortunately no amount of good acting or singing was going to save the poor writing and directing of the story
Feb 23 2024,negative,i love the idea but fell very short 
Feb 22 2024,negative,the only decent songs were the chickens and the villains no one appreciates me song the story is decent though the villain is fairly simple and the script is dumb the character animation is good but the backgrounds are all in a very bland color palette making for a blandlooking movie dont waste your time
Feb 22 2024,positive,star was cute so was valentino as the comic relief it was a decent watch story felt a bit hollow to me the random bursting into song reminded me of musicals like the king did not need to be in two songs he was an easily defeated villain easy movie for kids to enjoy but maybe a bit too simple for grown ups
Feb 21 2024,positive,the animation and attention to detail was unlike any disney movie ive seen before it was amazing
Feb 21 2024,neutral,after hearing so much negativity about this film i decided to watch it without prejudice and with an open mind the storyline to me at least seemed unique enough to keep me engaged i found myself genuinely laughing a few times throughout the film   the musical numbers in this picture are not memorable and i doubt any child would be singing along to them i think i would have appreciated it a little more if disney committed fully and went old school with the animation instead of this weird blend of styles they used for the animation  its not the worst movie ive ever seen but its far from disneys best your children will probably enjoy it enough
Feb 20 2024,negative,wow this was absolute trash  dont waste your money on this film
Feb 18 2024,positive,mid i didnt ever care about the story or characters music was ok
Feb 18 2024,neutral,its okay not great not terrible
Feb 17 2024,negative,under normal circumstances id just write wish off as another dull bland soulless and forgettable release from the oncegreat walt disney animation studios as it continues its descent into obscurity however as this was meant to celebrate 100 years of the studio i expected more     the story has some good ideas but arent really wellexecuted the characters are uninteresting asha isnt really someone i care to follow for an entire runtime magnifico is one of the least interesting villains in disney canon the supporting characters are all bland and pretty pointless       the animation is weird i see what they were going for but its just very offputting and does not work the voice performances are okay chris pine is definitely hamming it up as magnifico there are references to previous films but its so lazily done and typical of current disney the musical numbers are forgettable i cant remember any of the songs which has never happened for me with a disney animated feature this movie is about ninety minutes but feels as if its over two hours      you know jeremy jahns said it was more of a celebration of current disney as opposed to a full celebration of the companys hundred years of existence and i totally agree and its a shame i held out some hope that theyd put a little heart and effort into this one but at the end of the day wish is simply further proof that the magics gone and it brings me no joy to say that
Feb 16 2024,positive,great story amazing songs and beautiful animation
Feb 15 2024,negative,what a load of rubbish doesnt deserve to be a disney movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,this disney film give people joy to the world
Feb 15 2024,negative,cant believe this has a better audience score than shrek forever after
Feb 14 2024,negative,forgettable characters bad script insufferable main character soulless songs and more    but this movie teach us a valuable lesson every wish should be granted no matter the cost or consecuences at all cmon
Feb 14 2024,positive,we loved this movie  i was hesitant because it didnt do well in theaters but its good old fashioned disney with tons of references and easter eggs to the classics   the songs are catchy and i dont mind when my 2 year old wants to listen to them on repeat    i hope this movie get the attention and credit it deserves streaming
Feb 14 2024,negative,a total embarrassment for disney to present this as their 100 year production poor animation poor soundtrack senseless songs tossed in at a whim they tout references to their past shows but its lame at best no real connection at all not one memorable thing from the whole movie sorry disney you failed big time if this is all you have to show for 100 years of some fantastic productions
Feb 12 2024,negative,ironically the best part of this movie was the credits scene it was nostalgic nevertheless it hasnt a good script nor should be a piece to celebrate disneys centenary
Feb 12 2024,positive,songs were catchy though plot and pacing is a bit jarring at times overall a good disney film for kids to enjoy that also honors its history of magic
Feb 12 2024,negative,a movie that celebrates what disney has tried and failed to achieve in its 100th year rather than what its accomplished over its 100 years like it was try to perceive and trick audiences into believing
Feb 11 2024,positive,i know my films and this is great critca are weird  the art  music and story is top shelf disney and i love the dark glow effects used throughout
Feb 11 2024,negative,that is just a complete mess in the form of a film just another disney horrible film
Feb 10 2024,positive,such a great tribute to past disney classics kids loved it
Feb 7 2024,neutral,wish is the new disney animated musical which is to celebrate 100 years of disney the movie follows asha played by ariana debose as she makes a wish so powerful that a star falls to earth and befriends asha and teams up with her to take down king magnifico and free everyones wishes the movie also stars chris pine evan peters and alan tudyk i went into this movie hoping that id have a different opinion than others that had seen this movie but honestly this movie is mediocre and just recycles old material and i noticed that with the opening musical act which feels like a ripoff of the encanto opening song i really enjoyed both debose as asha as debose is an amazing singer from this movie and from her work in west side story but the music in this movie is just not good and i have no problem with this movie recycling material if they use it to enhance the story and these characters and i can say that they tried but everything with this movie fell flat i even found myself questioning whether asha was the actual good person in this story as the reasoning for why the king kept the secrets hidden seemed reasonable overall wish can be entertaining when it comes to the recycled material but fails to keep me invested as the story and material just feels redundant and nothing feels natural in this movie it just feels like every story element feels forced together and tries so hard to make this the next classic that it feels like the big mouse house is focusing less on the creatives and more on the dollar signs wish gets a well deserved and disappointing c
Feb 7 2024,positive,this film embodies all the best elements of disney from over the years i havent seen a disney film in years that evoked the emotion i felt watching this one i loved picking out all the subtle nods to previous films and it was amazing to see my two year old nephews enjoy the film just as much as i did the songs especially this wish has that classic magical feel to it and it was great to see a truly evil villain i dont understand the negativity this film has received so dont let those reviews put you off from watching especially if you enjoy the classic films
Feb 6 2024,negative,a sad excuse for a disney film nothing interesting terribly vague and boring songs that dont capture any of the magic they were going ffor the artstyle looks cheap and even after seeing the explanaitions for it it missed the mark of any kind of watercolour or storybook theme not to mention that its a shame that the singers voices were autotuned to oblivion
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was a fine distraction for me and the kids but overall felt like it was missing any soul and seemed to just feel like a derivative of every other disney movie
Feb 6 2024,negative,i was honestly on the kings side and i doubt that was the intent of the movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,i love disney from the classics to the newer movies and usually i dont agree with the critics but hell i didnt expect such an emotionless story and characters really wish i could get my time back from this one
Feb 4 2024,negative,terrible one dimensional movie an epic fail
Feb 4 2024,positive,wish brings back everything we needed from disney that was lost along the way and still finds a way to give us even more than we have been given before     this film has found the way to be honest relatable enjoyable and magical for viewers no matter what age or walk of like someone is coming from ashas love and respect for her family and the people in her life was so powerful that she was able to make a change that gave everyone in her world something they had lost and needed  the wish that drives them we needed someone to tell this story to give us hope to remind us that we can find that strength within ourselves and if we all come together to help one another nothing is impossible    i do not know why disney did not promote this film as mush as it did with some of its other films tlm was crammed down our throats from every angle but disney sponsored promotion of wish never reached me the only reason i had even heard of wish was from some fb ad article about wish being the same quirky disney princess with an animal sidekick story  asha and her story are so much more than that i cant say more on without spoiling some of the smile nuggets that are placed throughout the film if you take the time to watch it youll see    please watch you will love it 
Feb 4 2024,positive,loved everything about this movie my grandchildren loved it too
Feb 3 2024,positive,story was okay with a few cute and humorous moments but it was more disappointing that the songs were not memorable
Feb 3 2024,neutral,nah      glad this movie is getting some blacklash    what i will say is i liked this movie better than encanto and strange world      yes i said it come at me its still not very good but its better than those two
Feb 3 2024,negative,really it looks like new animation for the characters and 1970s animated for the background good job on saving money disney sooooooo disappointing
Feb 2 2024,negative,bad villain terrible songs overall wish is such a borefest
Feb 2 2024,negative,i dont know why the audience really enjoyed this movie because it was bland they had a unique idea behind it but the movie did not capture it well this was one of their big disney movies of this year and it did not impress me in the slightest the first 15 minutes of the movie i found myself checking how much longer i needed to watch i have seen disney do better the only thing that is doing for this movie is the art style they used the twist was expected and the kids were bored
Feb 2 2024,positive,wish turned out to be quite enjoyable while the soundtracks may not be flawless the storylines concept appealed to me i actually found the poster to be quite visually appealing the reprise scene wherein the protagonist overcame the antagonist managed to evoke a slight tear from me a rarity when it comes to films or shows for me kudos on disneys centennial celebration
Feb 2 2024,negative,in all honesty i thought this movie really sucked being a disney movie the songs in it just werent it specially compared to other recent disney movies and the characters felt all over the place
Feb 1 2024,positive,it is clearly not the best disney movie i have seen in my life it is true that they made this film to pay a tribute to previous ones and that the story isnt the most interesting onebut i as a disney fan  have quite enjoyed it i think you should see it at least once or twice in your life because asha is beautiful and because music is pretty cool
Feb 1 2024,positive,overall the movie was good but i dont recommend small children seeing it i would hate to think that they actually think that someone can possess their wishes and destroy them i think it was a little too violent for small children but my friend and i being senior citizens lol we enjoyed it
Feb 1 2024,negative,i feel like everyone that rated this movie highly is paid to do so
Feb 1 2024,negative,my kids didnt care for it  what happened to original story telling
Jan 31 2024,positive,ok so this movie is actually good but their is some flaws  revealing the villian to early in the movie  i think its pointless   the villian it self was chaos and keeping all the wishes and not granting them and taking the power  the music tho is amazing
Jan 31 2024,positive,i think its a cute movie because its filled with dazziling animation interesting characters i really liked asha and king magnifico was one dastardly villain catchy songs and nosgalic moments for long time disney film fans though the story could use some tweaking as it does use a lot of elements from prievous films
Jan 31 2024,positive,good movie with plenty representation not surprised when critics and major media dont support
Jan 30 2024,negative,i am disappointed by the effects and the songs it seems disney is no longer producing great animations like before
Jan 29 2024,positive,it was amazing i want a part too with more details about her and maybe to see the king come back and try to ruin the island again
Jan 29 2024,positive,it was it was interesting
Jan 29 2024,positive,was alright super simple story predictable but i thought the songs and general vibe was pleasant and nice nothing mind blowing but its enjoyable imo
Jan 29 2024,neutral,wish    in this asha a seventeenyearold girl in the kingdom of rosas wishes upon a star which comes alive together they both team up to bring down the evil ruler of rosas magnifico crafted to mark disneys centennial it serves as an origin story for the wishing star    wish does a lot to pay homage to former disney movies in this it has a familiar air around it which doubles as a positive and negative its too familiar to the point that its bland and the magic it tries to portray falls flat    the songs featured here vary from impressive to fair and then unnecessary but ariana debose who sings most of these songs has a beautiful voice that manages to shine through the animation here is cool but nothing spectacular the voice cast is capable    its a shame that wish is what disney culminates its 100 years of animation on    4510
Jan 28 2024,positive,its a very nice story with sympathic caracters
Jan 28 2024,negative,did my kid enjoy this no he did not and nor did i that is all 
Jan 28 2024,negative,no sense maybe the worst disney animation on history
Jan 28 2024,positive,ignore the bad reviews this film is amazing and the songs are fantastic
Jan 28 2024,negative,this was just okay nice songs but the story line be just all over the place for me didnt feel like the movie id go see more then once
Jan 28 2024,positive,wish may lack a certain charm other disney films have had in the past  but it is still a good movie with some great music a unique art style and a complete plot which offers more than many films in the past few years have
Jan 28 2024,positive,i cant understand the lackluster reviews this has gotten ive watched it about 8 times and it just continues to get better so many great little details and easter eggs its like you can see something new with each viewing    beautiful animation great music and a moving story about perseverance and faith in the face of great adversity its also a movie about living up to ideals not looking up to idols theres a lot more too    my family loves it it is a movie filled with beauty
Jan 27 2024,positive,it was so nice the animation style and storyline really feel like im watching a modern but yet old school disney film it is nostalgic and lets me think of my childhood this was the best movie for the celebration of disney 100th anniversary
Jan 27 2024,negative,it felt like an extended episode of a disney jr cartoon lacking the excitement of past heavy hitters
Jan 27 2024,positive,original with some well placed nods to disney classics  hopeful and inspirational at a time when hollywood seems to want us all to blow our brains out
Jan 26 2024,negative,lame one long commercial kids were bored
Jan 26 2024,negative,horrible the movie just  jumps into the whole blnd soulless musical idk who the chrcters are very stndard basic with no deoth to them the plot jumped so fast you couldnt bother to care about it very weak and badly planned movie the animation was also terrible they relly thought this was strong enough to follow encanto
Jan 26 2024,positive,i love this movie its simple with many easter eggs and very funny im in love with star and the songs its perfect dont pretend to be something mega ultra innovate its a pressent for the disneys fans
Jan 26 2024,positive,kids loved it beautiful animation and music lots of laughs
Jan 25 2024,positive,i think its a good movie music is amazing and the characters are fun i didnt really like the new animation style combining 2d and 3d but i see it as a tribute to all the movies animated in 2d style the story is nothing new and a bit of cliché but i think that the focus wasnt on the plot it seems to me that this movie as a whole should be taken as a presentation of 100 years of work and not as a new amazing standalone but maybe as a summary of all the disney works and it was fun for me to find all the references to older films i just think of it as a journey full of nostalgia
Jan 25 2024,negative,the king is the villain because the movies tells you he is since his reasons actually make sense lets have an evil book brainwash him into becoming evil so that there are no more doubts and that we can imprison him inside a staff for the rest of his life
Jan 25 2024,positive,the music a great story with hope and magic  it was everything that i expect from a good disney movie
Jan 25 2024,negative,be careful what you wish for    wish is a 2023 american animated musical fantasy film produced by walt disney animation studios and distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures it was directed by chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn in her feature directorial debut      meh it passed the time   sort of     the animation is supurb   the songs and storyline are not    asha a sharpwitted idealist makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force  a little ball of boundless energy called star together asha and star confront a most formidable foe  the ruler of rosas king magnifico  to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars wondrous things can happen
Jan 25 2024,positive,i dont understand these so called critics maybe time to get an actual job i thought the movie was absolutely watchablenothing that will knock ur socks off but nowhere near as negative as they said
Jan 25 2024,negative,great concept but poorly executed its like they had everything but fell short with making basic safe choices in their execution and in story telling it just couldve been so much more i really hope this movie is a sign for higher ups to get out of the way of artists story telling too many cooks in the kitchen and not enough time made to develop concrete ip
Jan 24 2024,positive,a very bythenumbers disney movie that feels like it was written by a committee of execs instead of team of writers with an organic inspiring story to tell despite some stunning visuals and some solid voice acting the plot is almost entirely forgettable     the result is a film that may leave many viewers especially those over the age of 10 feeling rather bored
Jan 24 2024,negative,if you told me that this movie was made in 2005 i would have believed you disney animation is in a rut yes the technology is there but not the art of animation there is zero originality in the animation we have seen incredibly creative new ways to present animation but it seems disney has no interest in trying new things also a bit tiring of seeing gogirlpower movies since 2010 disney has had only two minor releases dealing with being a boy big hero 6 and luca compared to an annual major release about a girl discovering her superpowers enough pandering
Jan 24 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie from start to finish the little mouse and star are so cute in particular  funny and emotional movie it has something for everyone whether kids or adults also cleverly deals with adult themes like narcissism gaslighting and futurefaking
Jan 24 2024,positive,i love this movie from the soundtrack to the animation yes it may be a little generic but its made to show all the movies in one love the plot though and references
Jan 24 2024,negative,nothing to say its just stupid and bad nothing new under the disney sun
Jan 24 2024,positive,wish is a special animated film the graphic of this movie is combined by the old animated 2d and new animated 3d the most important of the film is about the 100 year anniversary of disney for me i think wish is the best animated movie that everyone should watch the story telling of this movie is very reality in real life especially in some country who doesnt have freedom the citizen in that country have been controlled under the government back to the movie the songs are so good each of the song has meaning and the actors are so passion i wonder why the critics they underestimate this film so much i think this film is more deserve than their mind
Jan 24 2024,positive,wish wasnt horrible it wasnt the best either  for me there was just too many songs i did enjoy most of the songs to the point when they sang the songs in unison the same lyrics of that song and that there was almost literally 1 song moment every 10 minutes   i would have loved it if what was on that tapestry was explained in some way or how the king came in possession of that dangerous book
Jan 24 2024,negative,too many songs that disrupt the plot and none of the jokes land this may be the worst disney animated film and its sad it was the 100 anniversary movie
Jan 23 2024,positive,beautiful in sight song  especially story see it for yourself dont take the critics word for it they got it wrong  for good reason it doesnt match where they want societys money or ideas invested i wish i spent my money at the box office instead of waiting on the convenience during a snow storm to buy it on a streaming service in the comfort of my home like ive gotten accustomed to postcovid id gladly have forked over double just to support a film that deserves it
Jan 23 2024,positive,clever animation mixing the forefront characters in a modern style whilst the background has that classic disney animation style think beauty and the beast robin hood etc i loved the message throughout and not to give up on your dreams no matter your age and nobody can try and take those dreams away from you i think ashas nationality and image will help many children feel represented which is special but what really got me on a personal level was the credits rolling and looking back at all the characters i grew up with and to be sitting there after all these years almost gasping like a child and pointing at the different characters with my own children really got me choked up disney is loved by generations and that is magicali think this was beautiful unique and uplifting
Jan 23 2024,positive,that movie was great
Jan 23 2024,negative,ok it was all bad like really bad but good news i know how to fix it first toss all the songs they all sucked next hand draw it so it feels like the classics you are trying to get us to remember that we all love hire a real musical song designer and for the hero song use when you wish upon a star smh how this was not obvious  and last the people were said to have been from all over so why do they all look and sound the same you want to be inclusive so be inclusive and give them outfits and voices from all over i am not a smart person but i guarantee if this was done you would have had a hit after all that if you have time maybe give the villain some reason for being evil like getting tricked by the book or you know just hire melol oh yes one last idea have the old man start the song as he sees his granddaughter being hurt so it fulfills his wish and ties everything off with a bow
Jan 22 2024,negative,you could say disney is killing it and by it i mean its company
Jan 22 2024,positive,i wanted to really like this movie but i did not sadly the animation was okay and the songs although kind of forgettable were good but the script was pretty bad it used a lot of disney tropes and didnt really add anything new
Jan 22 2024,negative,total dissapoitment disney you did ot again even with no expectation you dissapoint jajaja
Jan 21 2024,negative,we could have had a gorgeously 2d animated story with unique characters and a compelling plot instead moneygrubbing ceos put everything bad about disney into a blender and called it their magnum opus hopefully this will serve as a lesson to let artists do what they want i will never get over how we lost that star boy romance because they wanted to sell more toys
Jan 21 2024,positive,epicesplendidamazingextraordinário movie  disney classic centenary
Jan 21 2024,negative,i was not impressed with this disney film the animation looks unfinished which makes you feel they rushed the film the characters are forgettable and the songs are the worst i have heard from a disney film
Jan 21 2024,positive,beautiful film with beautiful references a good story and songs that structure the story
Jan 20 2024,negative,honestly this is the worst disney movie ive ever seen the music was clunky and literally sounded like ai wrote it its sad how disney went from the classics of the 90s to this
Jan 19 2024,negative,without doubt the worst disney movie a complete flop the animation itself is great everything else to do with the film is shockingly bad
Jan 18 2024,negative,this movie was a total waste of time disney is losing money with this
Jan 17 2024,positive,what a lovely movie really great songs all the way through it seemed like disney went old school it had good meaning to it and they delivered the message well me and my 7 year old loved it
Jan 17 2024,positive,loved the movie i thinks it works as a fan service since it has a lot of references from classic movies the story is basic but meaningful
Jan 17 2024,negative,watchable but pandering
Jan 17 2024,positive,very good movie i recommend it
Jan 15 2024,neutral,with caricatured characters and a notatallmemorable villain wish only takes itself a little seriously because of the charismatic protagonist a great secondary character the star some good songs and thats it the script would also need to be better for me to increase my rating of the film
Jan 15 2024,positive,this film is essential to watch in the company of the family it is very fun and it reminds us of the importance of deaths and how to make them come true
Jan 15 2024,negative,the animation was beautiful as per usual with disneypixar films the story and songs however left much to be desired the main character didnt have a clear motivation and the side characters were forgettable the main villain was worse both he and the main protagonist had tragic back stories but these stories were barely even glossed over and the conflictresolution made no sense its a shame this is disneys 100 years tribute clearly they value profit over telling a good story nowadays and gone is time where they were innovative with their art
Jan 15 2024,positive,my 8 year old daughter and i really enjoyed it better than i expected and a great mix of humor meaning and magic
Jan 14 2024,negative,poor sound quality not a very good story
Jan 14 2024,neutral,i really wanted to love this movie  but it just didnt work and the more i thought about it upon leaving the theatre the less sense it made instead of celebrating disneys musical legacy it celebrated the convenience of autotune rather than a simple classic story it left plot threads unanswered left right and centre and a nice first act led in to a disappointing second act and an absolutely unearnedfeeling conclusion while i dont regret watching it its not one ill be rushing to put on again any time soon and not one that will make it into the list of disney greats
Jan 14 2024,negative,this is a boring slog to get through do not recommend this is a completely nothing film where the direction for the villain changes halfway through the music is bad with one decent song oh also it has the worst line ive ever heard throw caution to every warning sign great animation and interesting villains wasted on the worst movie ive ever seen
Jan 14 2024,positive,i watched wish today with my family and its fantastic its a very beautiful film and perfect for the whole family the art direction is beautiful
Jan 13 2024,positive,great movie to take my granddaughter to enjoyable and relayed some good values
Jan 13 2024,positive,excellent musical score appreciate that the story line was doing right prevailed over evil
Jan 13 2024,positive,honestly enjoyed it the singing parts were powerful and amazing story kept my attention and it had some funny parts too
Jan 13 2024,positive,i personally really liked this movie and feel its been getting a bit too much hate sure it has its flaws that do kind of bug me but it still feels like a good disney film the animation is also very good there are some parts that look a bit funky but for the most part is great i also really admire the music as a pop fan i dont mind the decision of making the songs more poplike   a good movie with a great cast that i like even with its missed opportunities
Jan 13 2024,positive,it was missing the magic a disney film usually hasit was hard for my kids to follow the storyline and seemed more about the bad guy than about the good
Jan 12 2024,positive,wish was a cute movie with an adorable little character called star that captures your heart however the storyline left something to be desired after disney put out frozen certain expectations are put out sadly wish leaves one wishing for a better plot
Jan 12 2024,positive,a must watch for true disney fan of the animated classics i loved all of the easter eggs and references to some of their most classic titles it really felt like the perfect movie to represent the 100 years of the companys history the music was amazing i cant stop listening to the songs and the combination of hand drawn and cgi made a completely beautiful animation
Jan 11 2024,negative,this is a bad movie filled with so much bad story and character writing the story needed more time and was so like they had the story in a list but had no idea how to progress between each im feel like they jumped the motivations to fast and with no chill i felt the music was more in the line of illumination film and not for a disney film it breaks the story and doesnt flow out of the characters right i felt they did not care for the art of what made them the lead in western animation or former leading disney used to use the music for the story and characters for info and a way to progress the stories the wanted franchises for this and other and it shows so without passion and life i do like the basics of the story but they dropped it in the first act i could have seen this work if given the effort was there
Jan 10 2024,positive,disneys wish was a masterpiece to be the 100th anniversary film era for disney i saw it yesterday and i thought it was really talented and one of the best disney films that ive seen since frozen  and the liveaction version of cinderella in 2015 with the creators behind frozen 2013 and moana in 2016 this is the best 100th anniversary film ever this reminds me back in the time when walt disney had first started walt disney animation studios for a reason overall this is another win for me this time to go to the movie theatres
Jan 10 2024,positive,it was a nice story showing a very brave and determined girl standing up for what is right
Jan 10 2024,positive,is a beautifull movie for kids
Jan 10 2024,positive,i loved the message of the movie the characters specially the goat the magic for a long while has been like disney lost their wayso happy to see they are still able to deliver beautiful stories
Jan 10 2024,positive,i wasnt expecting that predictable final but i loved most references to previous disneys movies and of course the music
Jan 10 2024,positive,i usually dont notice if a movie is too good or too bad im just here to enjoy the ride and i did its really nice i disagree with the plot holes others say it has it has a nice message and nice songs the animation was also cool i liked it
Jan 9 2024,positive,a good film full of references and with a really bad villain
Jan 9 2024,positive,it was good not the best but good
Jan 9 2024,positive,i got a friend request we talked for a few hours and when i found out he was a fraud i ignored all his messages i honestly wouldnt have suspected him if not for the exposure of a professional hacker whom i hired after realizing my bitcoin wallet had been emptied i sincerely dont know how or why these fraudsters operate and if they know the pain and trauma they cause in the lives of their victims when i found my wallet had been emptied i nearly had a cardiac arrest i am a 58yearold taxi driver and i need money now more than ever i resolved to find ways to recover the stolen money and thats when i found cyber genie recovery expert these guys used their wild tech skills to help me trace and recover all that was stolen from me within a short period i hired them i was really patient and understanding with them because after a few sessions i began to have my doubts during these trial moments cyber genies team was very persuasive and encouraging i am glad my doubts and fears never won because the recovery was a success at last all hopes lost were restored stolen money recovered and created a lifetime relationship with cyber genies team   cybergenieatcyberservicesdotc0m  wha sapp 12525120391  telegram cybergeniehackpro
Jan 9 2024,negative,boring kids were uninterested throughout the entire film such a let down unmemorable characters and songs which are usually disneys musicals strong point
Jan 9 2024,positive,good story with a nice message about wishes and hope great for my 45 yr old granddaughter and i to see together
Jan 9 2024,positive,great movie with great songs  unfortunately a little scary for our seven year old
Jan 9 2024,positive,i think this movie shows everything a disney movie represents its full of magic music a villain an amazing princess is this what a good movie is made for
Jan 8 2024,positive,lots of songs narrating whats happening colors and people have good dynamics similar to tangled

Jan 7 2024,negative,pretty standard disney fare formulaic without anything really new great for kids though
Jan 7 2024,negative,disney has lost the magic and really need a wish right now
Jan 7 2024,positive,great movie for kids and adults about wishes and reams coming trusp
Jan 7 2024,positive,what a nostalgic feel good movie with original storyline the fact is the critics that report to rotten tomatoes are special in all sense of the word this was a well dont movie with great animation and fits perfectly as the disney 100 movie the ratings by the audience is all that should matter this has characters you can fall in love with it has a great villain with depth the visuals the music all of these things make this one great new movie by disney the only reason why a critic would find fault in this movie is on their own prejudices
Jan 7 2024,negative,i wish i never watched this  movie it wants to be frozen sheik aladdin and cinderella at the same time failing to find its own phase style     the story lacks on a deeper level as well
Jan 7 2024,negative,the movie was really bad not ones at all make the movie better 
Jan 7 2024,positive,i liked the singing and the animation the story was a little weak and predictable but overall it was good for the younger age group
Jan 6 2024,negative,bad 2d animation but beautiful images  forgettable script and characters  100 years  disneys story deserves a much better celebration film
Jan 6 2024,positive,i thought it was beautiful the songs are great beautiful voices great plot and story telling i love the were all made of star dust theme our hopes and dreams our wishes  make us who we are the animation is beautiful its digital but looks like its done in water colors first big screen movie i took my 6 year old daughter to and couldnt be happier cant wait to watch it again
Jan 6 2024,positive,absolutely stay all the way through the credits
Jan 6 2024,neutral,i believe that wish is not the concept of disney animated films but ultimately the concept of their weaknesses
Jan 6 2024,positive,songs and concept of
Jan 6 2024,negative,wish had forgettable songs  the art felt so unfinished  the goat wasnt funny  for some reason the queen easily dumped the king without any hesiation like theyve been together for years
Jan 6 2024,negative,never went anywhere
Jan 6 2024,negative,honestly te animation and the music is fine but nothing that is catching attention that much in these years also is like a desperate intent on making money disney is not making good villains or music like before is more cliché also the storyline and the styling of the movie is not really something that can be appreciated disney movies are decreasing on creativity and quality
Jan 6 2024,positive,really cute enjoyed it a lot
Jan 5 2024,positive,honestly i was not looking forward to seeing this movie after watching the trailer however i was happily surprised by the storyline references to other disney movies and the music i think the trailer makes the movie look very childish and annoying but this movie wasnt too bad i have seen better but i have also seen much worse its not that bad of a concept and the musical numbers are pretty elaborate overall cute film
Jan 5 2024,neutral,what is happening to disney this felt like it was written by ai 
Jan 5 2024,positive,my daughter absolutely loved the movie  she now wants a talking goat  lol  very family orientated
Jan 5 2024,negative,so disappointed with this one the story line was meh the songs and singing were pretty awful in comparison to other disney movies the typically funny lines to engage adults were really really really bad and not clever at all and even the animation quality was terrible it seemed like they had to hit a deadline with a lot more work left to do and just kind of hot potatoed it to the theaters glad we caught it at a matinee and didnt pay full price we were baffled that it was just released to theaters in november and it wasnt even playing any more at the theaters in the city we were visiting for christmas  we had to wait til we got home to see it and now i understand why i honestly would have walked out of this one if my daughter didnt want more snacks lol
Jan 5 2024,positive,its a alright and classic disney movie but a few of the musical songs were very catchy and i loved seeing chris pine in it
Jan 5 2024,negative,the worst disney movie ive ever seen the characters have no personality at all the protagonist is the same adorkable that were already tired of and the villain is pathetic he never actually becomes a threat and is defeated as if he was the weakest character of them all the songs are terrible and some parts of the lyrics looks ai generated ask chat gpt to make a movie script and youll probably get something really similar to wish the animating style is ugly too they tried to make 3d and 2d like the spiderverse but ended up looking like something unfinished with ugly blending and weird looking parts there are some beautiful parts though ngl but most part of the animation is just bland what a shame that this was the 100 disney anniversary movie
Jan 4 2024,positive,is good so funny  and happy
Jan 4 2024,positive,kept my 6 year old granddaughter attention
Jan 4 2024,negative,this movie is objectively bad in a hollywood sense they spent so much time putting in references to better disney movies they forgot to put in an actual movie with a good plot and more than three good characters the only characters worth mentioning are asha and king magnifico disney can make good movies in these times like encanto but this movie falls flat on its face while illumination and dreamworks made better movies i just want that to sink in
Jan 4 2024,negative,the movie is boring and lacks of plot and writing  disney you dissapointed again the songs and writing feel like they were written by chatgpt the characters lack of personality the plot is like being talked not staged as intended the animation is bad 2d animation in the back nope spider man atsv or puss in boots the last wish that literally talks about wishes did a better job in 2023 dont watch this movie dont waste your time  i give it 2 stars because i am good the only good thing was the end credits putting original and classic disney characters other than that this movie is complete trash
Jan 4 2024,positive,really cute movie we loved it
Jan 4 2024,negative,really an absurd over the top wanna bee frozen movie  my 8yo daughter asked me all the time what the movie was about and  rightfully so  the theme is really far fetched and the movie needs the full time and far too many words to the explain it  the cute star and goat didnt make up for the flaws in the script and vage meaningless lyrics of the songs who were song far too loud and were no contribution to the storyline do not spend your money on this can i give minus points
Jan 3 2024,negative,i didnt like it it was another disney flop this movie was not worth watching at all i wasted my time all it had going for it was the visuals the story was bland and lacking in anything to grab your attention or hold you i found myself wondering off and not able to focus on the movie and pay attention very well the message that i gathered from the story wasnt that great either it was kind of dumb the message that all wishes should be granted all the time is absolutely asinine to think what if somebodys wish is very selfish selfcentered and would actually do harm to others around them should that wish be granted also wishes cannot just be granted because you want to be benevolent thats a fools way of thinking the story seem to wander off into different avenues and just i couldnt find it entertaining at all the ending was also dumb disney should do a much better job and go back to the old renaissance way of making movies
Jan 3 2024,positive,good movie no slow parts songs really good  definitely funny lines
Jan 3 2024,positive,unique animation style a good plot and story throughout the film
Jan 3 2024,positive,it is in my opinion one of the best disney movies of the last years catchy soundtrack good plot and characters and despite the common critic that would like to portrait the villain as underperforming it is one of the best ive seen in years 100 worth it
Jan 3 2024,positive,enjoyed the musical score
Jan 3 2024,positive,great movie even for adults lots of positive messages loved it
Jan 3 2024,positive,its animation is beautiful and the references to the 100 years of disney are very good my family and i love this movie and the story that the characters and the star who steals the entire show told the villain is great i give it 5 stars
Jan 3 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it was so cute the writers put so much thought into making this memorable for disneys 100yr celebration and even though kidsin this generationmight not see the references my generation absolutely did i caught most every reference to other classics there were so many comments about the movie copypasting things from other movies which is just dumb it isnt copypasting anything it is purposely referencing things from other movies for its 100yr celebration the story and the music and everything behind it was so well done yes the concept might gone above the heads of kids but if you ask them what the princess movies are really about they will respond with its a movie about a princess people love to critique every tiny detail of every movie now a days when really some movies are just good as it is and doesnt need to be nitpicked to death its nice to go into a movie and just come out feeling ok without thinking of ways it could have been improved my kids thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the writing was a greate tribute to disney especially the end credit scene we loved it
Jan 2 2024,positive,weve gone to the movies twice to see it my daughter love it
Jan 2 2024,negative,the movie and the animation looked horrible compared to previous disney movies its like it was hunchback of notre dame ii compared to first hunchback movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,i wish this film would get an oscar
Jan 2 2024,negative,oof is the perfect explanation
Jan 2 2024,positive,i dont get the backlash i saw this movie in theaters and honestly i loved it the disney easter eggs where so cool so honestly i recommend this movie for all ages 10 out of 10 watch the movie before you start hating   on it
Jan 2 2024,negative,the movie didnt really make sense was very confusing and pretty lazy for a disney movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,funny and charming and inspirational i loved it
Jan 1 2024,positive,first movie we ever took our 3 year old daugther to and it was the perfect film for it
Jan 1 2024,negative,it felt like an unnecessary film that served to retcon existing disney properties the songs are immediately forgettable and didnt advance the story the story was bland uninteresting the only saving grace was the artwork and animation style it was a fresh cgi art style that blended watercolor and rotoscoping id love to see more films that look like this in the future only they should have an actual substantial story to tell
Jan 1 2024,negative,it is so painfully sad to see disney make a movie like this the story is mediocre and doesnt have the same feeling as disney i personally am not a fan of the animation but it is very well animated and some scenes are visually amazing but the story isnt there its not memorable the songs arent something you would want to listen to more than once the characters are basic and have no qualites that make them stand out from other disney characters disney is stuck in a trope with princess and her lovable animal sidekick many movies were successful with this trope but we need something refreshing disney
Jan 1 2024,negative,weak storyline weak characters no connectionthis is just proof disney needs a change in management
Jan 1 2024,negative,disney sure has fallen far in recent years i gave it a chance taking the little ones hoping my expectations would be exceeded they were not the magic just wasnt there and both i and they were bored and restless i think well be skipping disney films for the foreseeable future
Jan 1 2024,positive,it was a great movie not much people watched it there was around 8 only 2 laughs came out of me but the movie had a good plot an ok movie to celebrate disney 100
Jan 1 2024,positive,lovely music great storyline
Jan 1 2024,positive,the star was adorable great story
Jan 1 2024,positive,super cute and my kids really enjoyed it
Jan 1 2024,negative,not the best disney film story line was pretty weak animation was meh
Dec 31 2023,negative,i dont like saying this but for a 100 year anniversary disney flopped the characters sucked the story was lame the singing hurts my ears i dont like the singing it was bad and the plot doesnt make sense spoilers ahead magnifico is a bad villain honestly at the start of the movie he is granting wishes and trying to help his community for the better and asha was just complaining like a whiny 5 year old the king should decide whose wishes he gets to grant he worked hard for that power to grant wishes he should be able to decide if the wish is dangerous or not and even then the king was contemplating on if he should do it or not i feel asha is the true villain and king magnifico was definitely not the most evil villain disney ever made as disney claimed that he is he is pathetic compared to other villains ive seen this year this movie is pathetic and i could tell you more but i dont feel like writing a full book on why is movie is bad perfect movie to watch if you wanna lose brain cells
Dec 31 2023,positive,one of the best disney movies we have seen in a long time music is very catchy and the message of the movie was better than most disney movies
Dec 31 2023,positive,the movie was a great blend of a new story with subtle nods to old classics my daughter loves asha the young heroine who does whats right and refuses  to conform to the evil king who keeps his unknowing citizens captive beautiful animation style and great story
Dec 31 2023,negative,it was okay i was expecting a little more but the songs sang in the movie wasnt the greatest coming from disney i felt like there was no effort to making the movie just one of the movies just to make to release at the moment for the holiday
Dec 31 2023,negative,it was a little boring the music was decent but overall i wouldnt see it again my eight year old fell asleep half way through
Dec 31 2023,positive,beautifully drawn  voice acting good  but it didnt inspire to see it a second time  my 5 year old thought it was ok
Dec 30 2023,positive,the songs are enjoyable this is a delightful and original story great family film
Dec 30 2023,positive,my 45 year old loved it theres a few good songs and scenes that made him smile and giggle not as good as moana was his general reviewthe animation is beautiful and a brilliant callback to the classics i really enjoyed it not sure why the critic score is so low  it plays just like any other disney film
Dec 30 2023,positive,i havent disliked a disney film this much in a while felt rushed yet slow characters didnt make sense its just a money grab
Dec 30 2023,negative,not a very clean origin story for wish upon a star
Dec 30 2023,positive,we all loved the movie it brought back so many good members of all the past movies disney has done over the past hundred years
Dec 30 2023,positive,we dont understand why the critical panned this disney movie  we loved it  great music lots of disney easter eggs good storyline  im glad we saw it in the theaters
Dec 30 2023,negative,it was okay the animation was actually really beautiful and whimsical it felt like a classic disney film so bravo  but i just wanted wish to be more of its own film like encanto the directors were way to focused on all disney references from other movies to celebrate their 100 years of disney that the narrative fell flat the supporting characters like dahlia were kinda boring and rather meh compared to any other disney princess supporting characters the other goofy friends were also very meh and very cringe at times 4 of the songs were awesome including the opening soundtrack the duet song with the king and asha her solo and the villain soundtrack but the animal forest singing a song about being a star sounded like it came straight out of sofia the first and sesame street overall this film was a big disappointment and it could of been amazing if they went in a different direction
Dec 30 2023,negative,music and lyrics seemed very forced coupled with a lackluster plot and story
Dec 30 2023,positive,this movie is a perfect example of a meh movie this movie takes no risks and it shows it feels like disney was just trying to check all of the boxes for a disney princess movie it has cute talking animal sidekicks a quirky protagonist and a villain there just arent enough redeeming qualities about this film to make it interesting it is almost like disney went to chat gpt and asked it to write a script for a disney movie its just the same tried and tested formula that disney has done a thousand times
Dec 30 2023,negative,gowns beautiful gowns
Dec 29 2023,positive,movie was great songs are lovely tones of easter eggs just a really great film
Dec 29 2023,negative,i wish my money back this is most generic princess story disney ever made its not so colorful mostly blueish and desaturated one or two songs are nice odd animation 2d and 3d dont blend well lame story and kids were bored i fought boredom by tracing references and easter eggs or rather memberberries but its not enough to call this movie even mediocre streaming quality disney magic is gone and unlikely to return pros its not remake or reboot cons generic even more generic and finally boring ps celebrating 100 years of the company with this film shows how low disney has fallen its time just walk away
Dec 29 2023,positive,beautiful story great animation
Dec 29 2023,negative,the songs were verry bad and the story was un understansabel i asked 10 persons in they liked it everybody sayd no
Dec 29 2023,positive,its both charming as it is enchanting a throwback to the classic movies of walts days and in the big leagues as the classics too even with all the catchy songs and memorable characters its an all round solid hit recommended for everyone both young and even the young at heart to enjoy for generations to come
Dec 29 2023,neutral,it was cute and not too long  the throwbacks to previous disney classics were perhaps too subtle  are we living in a wreckitralph metaverse or not    poor songs forgettable setting some kind of afrocarribeanasianflorida and a onedimensional villain    modern classics like moana or frozen know how to set a scene and throw up some memorable bangers  this movie doesnt
Dec 29 2023,positive,i love the wish movie my 4 year old is so in love with this movie as well she made me take her to see it twice all she wanted and got for christmas was toys and stuff from the movie she is in love with characters especially asha she expressed that she loves how much asha looks just like her which makes her love the movie even more each time i saw the movie i found myself laughing singing because of course we play the songs in the car everyday and crying at those sad yet triumphant parts that disney always has i can tell the actors put their all into the movie ariana deboses voice is magic you truly cant deny how beautifully she sings these songs chris pine is always amazing we just really enjoyed this movie so much that i didnt notice any references or anything at all until i read the ratings completely after we fell in love with it i am so glad i didnt read any reviews prior because this movie is super cute and i think its weird that adults rate movies meant for children anyway these are the same people who literally used to watch air bud everyday as a child and they have the nerve to pick a part a disney production literally made for children while my actual child is obsessed with this movie im sick of how harshly movies are picked a part these days after people literally worked years or months to present their own project how they wanted to present it its weird to me i think when people watch movies with main characters that they feel dont look like or represent them they always find the movie to be boring or they dont like it it feels like when they cant see themselves in the characters its a terrible movie because youre watching a movie a about someone else and you feel entitled for it to be about you my ex husband used to say movies with female leads are boring and always bad but its because he cant see himself in that character and he was narcissistic enough to feel movies should only be about things relatble to himself but just like other movies that i have seen that have people that look like me in it and have a bad rating i always say im pretty sure this movie wasnt for them and this one was definitely for my little 4 year old girl who said this movie touched her and made her cry and she loves that she can see herself in asha its a really beautiful movie that i have been enjoying with my sweet little girl who lights up at the magic singing our hearts out to the songs and i honestly cant name anything i disliked whatsoever because its a movie meant literally for children you know
Dec 29 2023,positive,the movie wish was a cute movie i took my 2 grandchildren ages 12 and 7 they liked the movie however considering it was supposed to movie for kids and the script contained too much adult scripting i fail to understand why disney made this more for older teenagers and adults this had the makings of a great disney movie but they missed the mark i wish i had saved my money and waited to see it when it was streamed we attended the movie at a theater that used to be very clean with amazing movie seats and great food however it was extremely dirty nasty broken down recliners and horrible food marcus theaters has forgotten to maintain the auditorium completely it was so nasty even my grandchildren were hesitant to sit in the recliners marcus has snack foods popcorn nachos pretzel bites were so terrible no one would eat it we threw 63 down the drain we will never go back to the marcus theater in st charles mo if you wish to see this movie take care if you visit a marcus theater be sure to take hand sterrh
Dec 29 2023,positive,it was a really nice movie especially for my granddaughter to relate too
Dec 29 2023,positive,its not a bad movie in general the beginning isnt that great i liked the last 30 minutes of the film more and i found them really good also i love how they did the antagonists powers  the idea of the starboy wasnt bad but unfortunately they discarded it  unfortunately for being the movie to celebrate disneys 100th anniversary its nothing special
Dec 29 2023,negative,tried to go in with an open mind but yeah its bad  even ignoring the disappointment of missing out on another traditional hand drawn 2d animation  the pacing is awful it sprints past you like a kid on adhd running a marathon and tries to cram in ideas that couldve made the film 6 hours if they fleshed them all out  they should have picked a few and stuck with them  i dont know if the songs were ai generated but the lyrics just dont stick with you even magnificos song which is the only one i sort of remember has lines like i let you live here for free  and i dont even charge you rent  and as someone who misses the classic disney villain you can see the potential there we could have had another frollo if they wrote him well  but you get bits of that bits of gaston bits of hans hes not grounded in anything doesnt feel like a real character theres a bit of exposition trying to justify that thats also rushed and not done well thats another thing this film relies far too much on exposition they tell and dont show save for cramming references down your throat but in a way that feel forced and lacking heart its a shame but ironically disney did more of a parody of itself here than a proper tribute
Dec 28 2023,negative,cheap looking animation that looks like a filter most of the time dull predictable and flawed story lack lustre songs for the most part
Dec 28 2023,positive,pretty lame i took 6 and an 8 yr old boys they could not sit still and begged to leave just saying
Dec 28 2023,negative,without a doubt the dumbest most backwards messed up plot hole immoral filled story that disney has made in a long time
Dec 28 2023,negative,boring bland a lost of wasted potential
Dec 28 2023,negative,i didnt like that our seats didnt recline and the movie was to slow for my 7 year old to sit still for
Dec 28 2023,positive,creative story liked the images to disney liked the so i make this wish song the others didnt hit quite as well
Dec 28 2023,positive,love the character star in the movie so cute  sweet the songs are nice and the animation looks cool and fresh im a disney fan and i have to say this movies storyline is a bit different from the normal fairytale stories from the past love most disney movies including this one the ending is nice and inspiring love the idea of wishing upon a star  the encouragement to keep all dreams alive 
Dec 28 2023,positive,such a good movie for family my children enjoyed a lot thank you disney movie 
Dec 28 2023,negative,i dont see the idea behind things the music is okay i gusse the movie itself is rather boring
Dec 28 2023,positive,a little too scary for my 6 yr old granddaughter
Dec 28 2023,positive,i feel like it got a bad wrap after it came out due to the animation but it still had the feel goodness of any disney feature and the songs are very earwormy weve been singing them for weeks loved the little easter egg clues of other disney films
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was certainly not disneys best i didnt care much for the characters the songs werent brilliant i think only the main song was any good  the villain appeared to have a split personality one minute dark  brooding like maleficent  the next singing about how handsome he is like gaston  this may have been on purpose as it is basically a mash up of disney films but it certainly didnt work
Dec 27 2023,negative,had tons of potential all was flushed down the drain the goat was cute tho
Dec 27 2023,negative,this film commits the most egregious sin in cinema being boring without any real memorable moments
Dec 27 2023,negative,when your main character is worse than the villain
Dec 27 2023,positive,movie was ok nothing really stands out about it good tributes to disney movies of the past
Dec 27 2023,negative,this film is the story of a man who only wanted to do good for the people in case of a traumatic experience and the problem was only created by the bad upbringing of a girl who only cries because her wish was not granted this film is an offense to the classic disney they tried to make a better tribute
Dec 27 2023,negative,its just like any other disney movie some character gets something and takes advantage of it animation aside its just boring
Dec 27 2023,positive,beautiful and good songs
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie is an utter disappointment in every single possible way   the wish granting theme is awfully flawed and makes no sense   asha is just the old dorky clumsy and socially awkward character just like every single female disney protagonist before her ever since tangleds rapunzel  the songs s u c k  the secondary characters are dumb forgettable and annoying their lines look like they came straight out of a mcu movie their design looks awful and there are too many of them to remember or care about they are all useless and mediocre   the story is mediocre and uninteresting  the only minimally interesting character is king magnifico but he was wasted as the irredeemable villain throughout the movie and gets defeated in the lamest way possible  wow what a great movie to celebrate disneys 100 year anniversary thanks disney i hated it
Dec 27 2023,positive,i thought this movie was a memorable work as the culmination of disneys 100th anniversary i felt that there were scenes where you could see homage and fan service in various places and a lot of disney was packed and im glad that the animation is also like 2d however i felt that i wanted the story to be made a little deeper
Dec 27 2023,negative,hardly any storyline almost fell asleep
Dec 27 2023,negative,disney pr firms working hard to have fale positive ratings this movie sucked
Dec 27 2023,negative,just watched with my kids kids love it as they would love watching any animations from hoyets personally i felt this story is full of craps yes as a loyal disney fan who collected 98 disney movie in blu ray i love those easter eggs but the story goes too far ridiculous what a poor king looking after his kindom he built for so many years and facing a girl who though she is justice or something then he turned to evil and hated by all his people includes his only lover and the girl ashur is so empty i dont see anything charming from her not everyones wish will be granted of course and we gonna teach kids that the king only grant everyones wish means a good king
Dec 27 2023,positive,the movie was super cute and fun
Dec 27 2023,neutral,disneys 100th movie was a complete failure
Dec 26 2023,positive,what a fantastic movie the music was amazing the the songs were outstanding and the story was fun it was about time disney made a story about wishing upon a star loved it
Dec 26 2023,positive,reminded me of encanto liked the music it was a little long
Dec 26 2023,negative,formulaic basic no likeable characters the music was meh its like someone put together all the ingredients of a successful animation but without any actual love for it so it seems like it should work but it had no heart either that or im just tired out and jaded from christmas but this was bland and unenjoyable
Dec 26 2023,negative,if the story is empty the movie is full of disappointments even for the youngest
Dec 26 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i feel like it kept my attention and my kids attention very well and delivered a really nice message the music was good as well
Dec 26 2023,negative,urghh this movie is to encanto what the paint by numbers is to picasso  washed out watery amateur with an undoubtedly cheap finish  it didnt have a single original idea or memorable song there are episodes of sophia the first with more pizzazz and originality
Dec 26 2023,negative,fine for babies  animation is very inconsistent  story and plot are difficult to understand
Dec 26 2023,neutral,villian in the right annoying main character weak story good songs thats about it
Dec 26 2023,negative,its a pretty movie but awfully written the message is dangerous if your parents tell you no then disobey them is an easy message for kids to learn from this movie i wish disney released a movie with a real moral and with good values to follow this is not that   i wont be taking my kids to this
Dec 26 2023,positive,great story and beautiful animation
Dec 26 2023,positive,i absolutely adore this movie the songs are fun and catchy and i think its a great story its not the stereotypical princess meets a prince etc my kids and i saw it twice in the theater and we cant wait to watch it again 
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved this film music was great disney cameos and easter eggs were a fun surprise
Dec 26 2023,negative,wish holds the prize for the most pointed fingers in the theaters from audience members saying thats dopey or shes the fairy god mother a movie packed with easter eggs that doesnt cleverly tie them together and a star so useless youd almost have the same movie without it the only thing that held me onto the movie was the parts of me that waited for my predictions to happen only to learn that what i saw was it that was it an easter egg hunt here i had hopes that we were about to find out where all evil magic came from the book dictating that the reason every villain had green magic was due to this corruption they let bleed into their hearts that hed become the mirror that coaxed many others to follow his footsteps that because he became greedy he wishes now only to reflect his dark morals onto anyone who gives him the time of day i hoped the villain would eventually reveal a much more convincing reason as to why he turned evil than a mysterious magic is out there and im jealous    why was the kings background so uninvolved he had a motive for his leadership and it was originally good and he kept saying that he never wanted someone to deal with the same fate he had been bestowed it felt like a forced plugin that they forgot to branch off of ever     there isnt a single character to grow attached to were handed heaps of them characteraftercharacter the main character the goat her seven friends the king and his wife the star the mom the grandpa and a load of npcs that are meant to add to the kingdom but dont arendelle and corona felt like tangible true structured kingdoms rosas felt apart and location specific     animation i understand is meant to appear as a storybook as an animator myself i appreciate unique new takes on how to make there stories look and happen there were times that i thought i saw hair clipping into legs and arms but i may be wrong so im not going to judge this part too harshly     one star for the times the animation did perform well and beautifully half a star because thats all the star was in the film
Dec 26 2023,positive,this movie was just what i needed the story the history of disney the music and characters i loved it so  so much
Dec 26 2023,negative,im japanese and i use a translator the king is not as much of a villain as people say when i was shown the main character who overthrew that it was very painful and traumatizing for me
Dec 26 2023,negative,this is a dd a disney dud  nice animation but a ridiculous story songs are not worth remembering boring at times
Dec 26 2023,negative,nothing but a cashgrab from disney i do not believe that the style of this godawful movie is an artistic choice i believe this is laziness this is a very stereotypical disney movie you have a princesslike character who cares about helping people a villain with a staff and greencolored magical powers a marketable plushie in the shape of a wishing star and a talking animal in the end the villain whos only motivation is more power is defeated with the unbearable power of song there was a subplot with the villain where he had a traumatic experience as a child this could have redeemed the movie however the audience never got to find out what happened to the villain as a child i just walked out of watching this movie and i cant remember any of the characters names this entire movie feels ai generated and i wouldnt be surprised if it was i also wouldnt be surprised if the undeserved good reviews of this movie are also ai generated because any sensible person would see that this was garbage this movie just didnt feel human the amount of references to other disney movies is immense but i understand that this was to celebrate the 100 years anniversary however this is not an excuse to make a terrible movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was fun light hearted movie that i could watch with my kids without regret    i hope disney continues to make such good movies
Dec 26 2023,negative,probably the most generic disney film ive seen granted im young and havent seen all of them or revisited them in a long while while the animation and voice acting were splendid the script was lackluster and the lyrics to the songs felt generic the music is pretty good but far from classic
Dec 25 2023,positive,very good movie i loved watching it i am from india patna state
Dec 25 2023,negative,i just had an opportunity to watch this movie trailer looked alright and all the previous reviews and marketing claims that this will be new frozen made me really excited about this  only to get terribly disappointed   what is this movie its super childish like in times i was thinking this was made for toddlers but then they try to overcomplicate it with a message   animation is cute tho and the main song os quite nice   the trailer has the best bits in it and rest is just big meh   dont bother buying tickets waste of money rather watch frozen again
Dec 24 2023,positive,catchy songs memorable characters tons of easter eggs and the animation is beautiful the story couldve used a little work does raise a few questions but im content with it
Dec 24 2023,positive,wow  this was wonderful it was so much better than the cynical critics led me to believe ill definitely be jamming to the soundtrack later too
Dec 24 2023,positive,i love this movie its a great classic its got awesome cgi animation with cel shading and classic cinemascope process of 255 i want to see this again when it come out on home media and disney
Dec 24 2023,negative,bad as rotten tomateos on my friedge
Dec 24 2023,negative,plot and soundtrack seem forced whole thing is a bit off like it was written by ai  not good
Dec 24 2023,positive,spoilers in this review  ok so im reading through the reviews here and its kind of blowing my mind how many are saying the story is bland and bad wish is basically a direct metaphor for leaving religion as a deconverted former christian the metaphors in this film are so stark and overt they slapped me right in the eyeballs and made them leak basically throughout the entire movie  chris pines character magnifico essentially wholly encapsulates religion god and religious clergy people place their hopes and desires for their lives with magnifico but in so doing they forget their wishes and lose all their human drive and creativity that is unless and until magnifico decides to grant the wish answer the prayer  this is done via a wishgranting ceremony a thinly veiled metaphor for church complete with a showcase of new victims and making spectacle out of spirituality the main character asha ariana debose or religious deconstructee questions why magnifico would do things like keep the wishes all to himself not grant certain wishes yet still withhold them from the wish owner allow them to forget their wish in the first place hog the wishes warmth beauty and happiness for himself curse humans to be empty until their wish is maybe granted and many more things  this is met the same way it is met in real life with hostility gaslighting projection and fear over the possibility of the status quo being upset asha makes a selfless wish that humans in the town of rosas could have a higher form of life more than just empty lives full of waiting for their selfish answered prayers to take their dreams and lives into their own hands  seeing magnifico for the malevolent force that he is they fight back with love kindness and collective humanity  for anyone out there who has left a draconian religion that they did not have a choice to be born into this movie was made for you thanks disney happy 100th youve been telling all the right stories lately and influencing the next generation of impressionable young minds hats off for building worlds that arent rife with looney tunes style interpersonal violence
Dec 24 2023,positive,watching this movie felt like watching an instant disney classic i havent seen an animated disney movie this good ever since frozen and encanto best way to celebrate disneys 100 years of wonder i totally recommend this masterpiece 
Dec 24 2023,negative,this character is so over played the corky rebellious girl very disappointed
Dec 24 2023,positive,cute fresh good plot and music
Dec 24 2023,positive,if youre in the mood for an emotional and lifeaffirming movie wish is the perfect choice this film tells the heartwarming story of a young girl named asha who discovers the power of a sentient wishing star with a talented cast and a captivating plot wish is a mustsee film that will leave you feeling inspired and touched dont miss out on this incredible cinematic experience grab some popcorn sit back and let wish take you on a journey of a lifetime
Dec 24 2023,positive,loved this the movie had so many easter eggs in it  exceeded my expectations
Dec 23 2023,positive,it had a weird start like chatgpt wrote it but i got it at the end touched
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really wish ha ha this film was better because it has some great moments our nineyearold absolutely loved the film but the odd and confusing plot holes made it difficult for an adult without giving away any secrets the star of the film literally a star is so goofy and onoff again magical that it just doesnt allow you to suspend disbelief it is a shame disney made this there 100 year anniversary film because its too pushy in the wrong areas and lacks the charm that has made some disney movies so great that said young kids may really enjoy it also worth noting as of today it has a 49 on the tomato meter which means critics did not like this film and it is considered rotten by rotten tomatoes standards 
Dec 23 2023,negative,the movie felt artificial bland and lacking in both true emotion and direction its sad to see an animated disney movie fall so short when compared to beloved classics or even films released just a few years ago compare the characters stories and motivations to other disney films and youll quickly begin to see how little effort was put into making this film
Dec 23 2023,negative,weird storyline not much artistry dont bother
Dec 23 2023,positive,completely underrated movie this film is possibly the greatest thing to come out of disney since the live action remake era began the music is incredible and for the most part all of the of the characters are likeable some people like to say it appears ai generated but i dont see the connection overall this is a must watch and ill definitely be rewatching it when it comes to disney
Dec 23 2023,negative,an extremely disappointing movie for disneys 100th anniversary it has an interesting plot and good but not great songs but is dragged down by a bland setting and never ending meaningless disney easter eggs
Dec 23 2023,positive,goes to show you that critics dont get what most audience members want good to see disney going back to the roots that made it great
Dec 22 2023,positive,beautiful meaning and memorable songs
Dec 22 2023,negative,very boring my kids enjoyed the star the goat was cute but they did not like the deep voice the musical sequences involving the star and the woodland animals was cute all other musical sequences were forgettable other than the star the villain was the best character he had character development and was entertaining we wont watch this movie again dissapointing for disneys 100th anniversary
Dec 22 2023,positive,great easter eggs and a powerful story my 8 year old loved it and i enjoyed it too
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a cute movie nothing ground breaking in terms of story its a fairly straight forward disney movie style story my girls 4 and 7 loved it all of the references to old disney movies were fun
Dec 22 2023,positive,my daughter and i loved this movie it has a wonderful message for everyone from little to older its never too late to dream and to realize you are unique and special it has a powerful heroine who with the help of her friends and loved ones who prove you can accomplish anything the old disney references were nice easter eggs
Dec 22 2023,negative,the story doesnt make any sense people give a king their wishes who wrote this terrible script  stick to best selling stories because this was a clear miss
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved this movie it was old disney style movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,good family movie with plenty for everyone to enjoy
Dec 22 2023,negative,we thought this was supposed to be a kid movie but my kids didnt like it at all
Dec 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie but in comparing frozen zootopia encanto and moana this movie lacks a true narrative you can tell that the directors task was to tie in easter eggs from other disney movies as a first directive while trying to create a watchable movie they did that but its not on par with their other ip you can easily watch it later on streaming and have just as good a time as watching a saturday morning cartoon
Dec 21 2023,positive,this is one i am so so glad i didnt miss because i followed the reviews i absolutely loved it and i went with every intention of going along with the critics and finding it not so great just taking the grand nieces because its something they could go see wrong again amy it was fantastic absolutely loved it the kids were riveted ariana dubose hung the moon as far as im concerned chris pines does whatever the animated version is of chewing up the scenery and he was just fantastic loved the other characters the lyrics to some of the songs are some of the most intelligent and dense and creative that ive ever heard in disney music and finally of course the little star okay never since i dont know when have i seen a character be so much fun and so adorable as my grand niece put it without saying a word i would go see it all over again in a heartbeat i am very serious i usually agree with critics absolutely not this time dont miss it
Dec 21 2023,negative,did the writers only had 1 week to work on it or something even the animation seems incomplete and the musics are meh a shame what disney is turning to be
Dec 21 2023,neutral,its not that the movie is objectively bad its just that you know it couldve been better great movie for kids but i think we just got collectively spoiled with films like tangled and frozen that set the bar too high 
Dec 21 2023,positive,grand children really enjoyed it9 and 7
Dec 21 2023,positive,it was a wonderful movie with excellent messages for children and adults
Dec 21 2023,positive,as a real hongkonger i feel the same that asha feels we just want to protect this place protect our wishes that want this place to remain as our home i cried super hard at this wish reprise asha and the people in rosas success but we did not therefore you who is reading this comment please hold your wish tight put it deep down in your heart be kind and be who you are life is not a fair tale we lost our fight although we stand together disney movies just make us feel like there is a hope so i make this wish to have something more for us than this thank you disney thank you yall who ever wish to the star when you wish upon a star your dream come true
Dec 21 2023,positive,its a sad world we live in if people cant appreciate a feel good movie like this dont listen to the critics go see it yourself
Dec 21 2023,negative,throw up with this film no story no actual funny parts this film did not go well stop advertising this to be so big its not a deal disney
Dec 21 2023,negative,if i could give this movie no stars i would please save yourself the trouble of watching it
Dec 21 2023,positive,we loved it  good lessons and we all enjoyed it
Dec 21 2023,negative,i cannot explain how garbage this movie is the characters have no feelings no actual problem to really drive them forward the whole movie is just a mishmash of buzzwords with no flesh its like they took a bone from each other good movie and made a human centipede ruining the good traits altogether overall garbage
Dec 21 2023,positive,i loved the music and visual was great
Dec 20 2023,negative,i wish they would put more effort into making a movie
Dec 20 2023,positive,thought it was entertaining always a message in disney films

Dec 20 2023,positive,wish was such a cute movie with a great story and lots of very nice singing
Dec 20 2023,positive,family enjoyed it more than any movie we have seen in the theaters in a long time
Dec 20 2023,negative,i saw this movie for free plus the 2 fandango fee i left thinking i want my two dollars formulaic tripe i want my 90 minutes back one of the worst disney movies ever made
Dec 20 2023,positive,fun disney movie of good vs evil grandkids had fun  pleather recliner in medford movie theater was in disrepair and smelled like body odor
Dec 20 2023,positive,i didnt love it but i enjoyed it  there are some good and powerful moments  the songs arent always the best  much of the criticism ive seen is misleading
Dec 20 2023,positive,so i make this wish to see it again it was so good
Dec 20 2023,positive,this was such a great little movie i dont understand why there is backlash about this being a woke movie good grief its just a cute disney movie with great animation and sets a great storyline wonderful music and an inspiring message my two grandkids loved it and so did i
Dec 20 2023,negative,lacked all the charm of what we couldve had in the betas truly a masterclass in how a company like disney loses its touch
Dec 19 2023,positive,it was really cute but could have benefitted from another 20 minutes of plot
Dec 19 2023,positive,a great way to celebrate disneys 100th birthday i love the songs this wish and knowing what i know now i can feel the nostalgia from all the movies amazing job
Dec 19 2023,positive,family friendly movie with a positive message we really enjoyed it
Dec 19 2023,negative,this movie was not a good experience the story is not solid and very vague the animation looks like it is trying to rip off the spiderverse movies with its blend of 2d and 3d animation the character designs are ok and some songs are pretty good the villain song is terrible i feel like this movie could have been amazing if disney focused more on quality than quantity there are a few times where it feels like the plot is going to build especially in magnifico and ashas one interaction but it just never does there is no exposition and it feels so dull and soulless
Dec 19 2023,positive,i thought the movie was good enough for a fun family film but this movie is missing an important part a wow factor it doesnt have anything to make it stand out and be interesting among the other films that disney has made or others in the genre but the movie is still fun enough to have fun with the easter eggs songs and animation so id recommend this for those who just want a fun family film but not those who want are looking for an interesting or good movie
Dec 19 2023,positive,loved it took my 6 yr old daughter to see it it had a disney classic feel to it like the classics i watched as a kid very nostalgic for me
Dec 19 2023,negative,even our 5 year old granddaughter got bored and wanted to leave
Dec 19 2023,negative,the names accurate this movie is definitely from wish
Dec 19 2023,negative,the movie was sadly lacking personally i didnt enjoy it and my kids actually asked to leave the music was subpar and i was honestly surprised and how much it tried but failed the mention of old movies was cute but other than that ive never had my kids so disinterested they ask to leave and we frequent movies its something special we do as a family
Dec 19 2023,negative,worst disney movie ever  songs were mediocre and it was boring
Dec 19 2023,positive,classic disney with a good story and a warm fuzzy feeling honestly i really loved it i highly recommend
Dec 19 2023,positive,it was a good movie  lots of hidden and not so hidden references to old and new disney movie  starting out the songs were good but then they started getting mailed in and were lacking
Dec 18 2023,negative,this movie has a charm to it but at the end of the day it gets too convoluted i dont often pay attention to art in an animation but even i found it lacking some of the songs arent too bad but eh i just didnt get attached to this film like some of the past disney greats
Dec 18 2023,negative,wish is a disappointing  addition to the disney catalogue while it may have its moments of visual splendour it ultimately fails to capture the essence of what makes classic disney movies truly timeless and enchanting
Dec 18 2023,positive,catchy music  fun to watch  nothing inappropriate  ready to take the kids back to see it again
Dec 18 2023,negative,this was easily one of the worst movies ive seen  i wanted to like it but it gave no reasons to  the story is very shallow with absolutely zero character development  youre immediately thrown into the heart of the story and expected to care about the plight of the main character  you wont  the songs were awful as well  usually disney does a good job with the songs not this time  they basically just sing words in scenes and most of the songs just feel like they put them in to make it a musical but it doesnt belong  the writing is geared towards 4 year olds with no thought to adults as is usually the bread and butter of recent disney movies  the writing was some of the worst of any disney movie i can remember  the easter eggs felt just thrown in and a few of them just didnt belong  for this to be the 100th anniversary celebration movie it was beyond disappointing  i cannot recommend this movie to anyone
Dec 18 2023,positive,the movie has it ideas in place but it was poorly executed the plot seems fine and watcheable but doesnt stick to its theme that well asha had one character arc her finding out magnifico wont grant everyones wish her friends are pretty bland except for gabo for having a sassy personality and simon being the traitor friend magnifico seem evil but in reality hes just a narcissistic man who comes across an evil book gives him green magic and boom evil star is well star and thats about it the movie doesnt feel like anything kids will like it adults will forget about it its was all just verybland
Dec 18 2023,positive,everyone in our family enjoyed this it didnt have that one amazing disney song  but was a great and well done fun movie lots of cute and heartwarming moments
Dec 18 2023,positive,intense and can get a little intense in some of the scenes but over all a good movie
Dec 18 2023,positive,absolutely loved it the songs are very catchy the king can be a little creepy looking at times for little kiddos but we thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely watch it again
Dec 18 2023,negative,felt the storyline was rushed with a jumbled song every three minutes disney wanting to get this out for merchandise sales before the holidays the premise could be magical if was done correctly not a hit
Dec 18 2023,positive,felt like the pace of the songs were off not enough side character love and song arrangement was a bit meh seemed like it was a encanto imposter
Dec 18 2023,positive,plenty of easter eggs for disney lovers the songs were catchy and i loved the end
Dec 18 2023,positive,phenomenal art cast story and music knowing what i know now is one of the top animated songs ive ever heard in my life cant wait to watch again
Dec 18 2023,neutral,villain character wasnt that great not the greatest movie
Dec 18 2023,negative,animation looked reminiscent of runescape hard to believe that this was  a disney animation one of the first songs you hear sounds very muddled hard to understand she was singing
Dec 18 2023,positive,culminating disneys 100th anniversary this movie celebrates a century of animation with a heartfelt story that conveys the message to never stop wishing and never give up on your dreams almost every aspect of this movie is a nod to disneys rich history of animation a mustsee for anyone wanting to reconnect with their childhood and the movies that informed their young lives
Dec 17 2023,positive,a must see for anyone whos ever believed in wishes and hopes their lived ones wishes come true too so moving and shows the integrity and strength of love for your family
Dec 17 2023,positive,great for disney 100 excellent music that could rival en canto ending was a bit rushed but very fun and well written
Dec 17 2023,positive,the best from disney
Dec 17 2023,negative,wish is a disaster the animation was unfinished it felt like aichatgpt  wrote the songs and the script the words in the song were crammed into giant sentences it honestly felt like eminem was rapping there were a bunch of references to the oldies but it didnt make it better wish should have been its own thing with  classic 2d animation this was such a lackluster movie for the 100th anniversary disney do better
Dec 17 2023,negative,despite the arguably wonderful animation wish delivers just about the worst disney plot of alltime whenever i wasnt groaning about watching this aigenerated mess i was rooting for the goddamn villain all disney aims to do here is inspire their young viewers to follow your dreams there is nothing here that resembles disney 100 years ago even the credits were underwhelming the songs were once again aigenerated with lyrics that even i cannot comprehend i delivered 14 wishes this year thats a good percentage i mean what what has the villain done wrong here if i wished to murder the entire village of course he wouldnt grant it be grateful for that in real life you cant just wish to have a house with the mcs rule theyll crumble and die out within a year villain earned it mc just complained nd had things go her way i think a toddler would do more than the mc shes the worst disney protagonist of alltime and this movie has completely ruined my hope for disneys return id rather disney go back to their 1950s shows
Dec 17 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it had beautiful music and it was just a phenomenal to watch
Dec 17 2023,positive,wish is a beautifully animated movie but the plot just wasnt great
Dec 17 2023,negative,wishs writers are confusing wishes with dreams people need their dreams and goals but dreams are based in reality wishes are not   make wishes in one hand and disneys wish in the other hand and see which fills up faster  at long last disney and america have something in common wishing this movie was never made
Dec 17 2023,negative,so much potential so bad written one good gag one star
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie was amazing great sound track funny bits and made me cry three times
Dec 17 2023,positive,loved the movie be sure and stay until after the credits love how disney ties so many things together
Dec 17 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i took my 9 year old son who asked me on a date he loved it its worth an open chance
Dec 17 2023,negative,movie was horrible the animation style they took was painful to watch characters remained the same new main characters joining the story in the middle of the movie which makes them look like they shouldnt be in the movie plot is so simple but villains werent even right you didnt feel for the characters and the songs were not good and would be sung at worst time best part of the movie is when it ended it also starts off good but then went downhill
Dec 17 2023,positive,great story great music beautiful animation and overall great message and movie
Dec 17 2023,positive,great movie and i loved all the disney movie easter eggs
Dec 17 2023,positive,took my 6 yr old grandson and the story line and dialogue was hard to follow the music had great lyrics but again not something a child would grab onto the goat and the star were cute and carried the engagement   if the target audience was older then hope would have been better than a wish
Dec 17 2023,positive,a beautifully animated film and fitting capstone to the first 100 years of the disney companys animated films although it doesnt break any new ground its enjoyable and fun with plenty of disney easter eggs the mediterranean setting is a particular stand out  and you can catch the spanish influences ariana debose does wonderful voice work the film unfortunately just feels a little like manufactured fun but i do really love for its overall message that we can all help make each others dreams come true
Dec 17 2023,positive,soundtrack was amzing
Dec 17 2023,positive,okay so i am not sure why there is hate for this movie its callbacks to disney classics while still being at its core a great all round disney movie the soundtrack is also fantastic and allows for more flashbacks with a few bars from when you wish upon a star any disney princess or classic disney fan will find something in this movie to love i am sure of it
Dec 17 2023,positive,it was a positive feel good experience
Dec 17 2023,positive,it didnt feel like the generic remade disney movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,the songs are decent but the world is more lectured than built the plot has too many characters too little flow
Dec 16 2023,positive,great animation music in the style of encanto very strong story
Dec 16 2023,positive,sweet movie with a beautiful message
Dec 16 2023,negative,i feel like the songs were very meh for the disney 100 film i definitely thought they would do a lot more the movie just seems lazy and like they didnt really have much to go with
Dec 16 2023,positive,good movie with an original story good family fun
Dec 16 2023,negative,an obvious cash grab mediocre animation made by folks who think traditional is an impossible standard bad music obnoxious protagonist and an empty plot with empty characters
Dec 16 2023,positive,loved itclassic disney
Dec 16 2023,positive,it was okay pleasant enough for a rainy afternoon but it was pretty lacklustre and the score was awful like the composer and writers and musicians worked separately till the last moment and just forced what they had together not the usual melodic wonders we expect from disney shame it could of been a great movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,beautiful loved it when i figured out what direction it was going and being right in the end worthy disney songs finally
Dec 16 2023,negative,sad movie you would expect better for a 100year anniversary
Dec 16 2023,negative,its a very shallow movie it has every cliche in the book and there are so many easter eggs they almost forget to put a story for a movie to celebrate the 100th year anniversary it is s
Dec 16 2023,neutral,a middle of the road disney princess movie the art style is very good songs are ok   but the story itself doesnt know what it is i felt the main antagonist was kind of in the right to begin with what transpired with the protagonist was a bit contrived and unfair to the antagonist it all culminated in a bland ending that seemed to be building towards something more interesting
Dec 16 2023,positive,cute not the best of disney movies but had some great homages celebrating thr 100th stay til the end of the credits
Dec 16 2023,positive,wish was great made my daughters birthday wish come true
Dec 16 2023,negative,this movie had so much potential but at the end of the day it was a weak story easter egg riddled which made me feel that they where putting up as much smoke as possible to hide the fact they knew the move sucked then there was the music honestly disney hasnt had a good score since the 90s this one tops the list for the least thought out most clunky wording and the most forgettable remember when you use to want to hear a disney song on the radio or hummed it the rest of the day after you got out of the theater no risk of that with this movie i will say that the visuals where quite good which is why i say it has potential but man did they miss the mark no wonder critics panned this movie i think they where honestly just being nice
Dec 16 2023,negative,movie was super okay  two good songs and chris pine is great  several songs lacked that sin along quality story got bogged down a few times  story was locked in as homage to prior films and did that but it was clear ttory was built around that will thrill super fans and be soso for those not searching for easter eggs
Dec 16 2023,positive,amazing cute and adorable exactly what disney should do more often it is lovely sweet good songs entertaining i want more
Dec 16 2023,positive,so cute loved every minute
Dec 15 2023,negative,extremely bland characters and premise asha was a really poorly made knockoff of mirabel the goat was cute and the star was cute my little brother liked it but it left no lasting impact on him like a lot of other films hes 9 my mother slept through the whole thing so it was a nice nap for her i watched it and was incredibly disappointed its just bland
Dec 15 2023,positive,this was the second time seeing wish love all things disney so this movie was on my daughters list to watch once it came out in theaters she was singing along and cant wait for the movie to be out on dvd
Dec 15 2023,positive,this was a really good movie the ending credits give a moving tribute to 100 years of disney
Dec 15 2023,positive,super cute  movie a bit different and story line is absolutely terrific keep your wishes
Dec 15 2023,positive,this movie is for the true disney fans whilst i can understand how it might not be a big hit with everyone i think this movie has a fantastic sense of magic purpose and finding your destiny  which we all love in a disney movie the songs and story line was fantastic and the many many hidden disney nods and easter eggs were a disney fans dream to celebrate the 100th i will be seeing it again just to try and find more hidden gems and to warm my soul
Dec 15 2023,positive,will this become a disney classic no does it represent disney in a classical way yes simply put it is a cookie cutter film the plot lines and song cues are neon signposted to the point of ones internal monologue counting off and aone and atwo this in no way however detracts from a fun set of characters with a truly stunning display of animation i have never before seen texture like they have in this animated film it isnt just rich it is luscious oh and the star is the best character since aladdins magic carpet period
Dec 15 2023,positive,best disney movie ever  they incorporated multiple disney characters into it loved it so much
Dec 14 2023,positive,i was impressed on how rebellious disney acted through this movie alone the idea of letting it play out on rosas  an island that people really constructed to be free from governments which then got destroyed by the italian force     critizising power relations to much power often leads to evil even when there were good intentions involved in the beginning if only she would had refused the wand in the end     this movie emphazises on the union of the universe and all its creatures even a hint with just look at the mushrooms and you will understand     also in one song she sings knowing what she knows now she cannot go back and pretend to not know she needs to fight and i feel this is what is happening in our world a lot people see unjustice and they could get uncomfortable or change their behaviour but they prefer to close their eyes and forget     this movies empowers to follow your dreams believe and work for them to make them true dont wait for others to fullfill your dreams for you     the music is so beautiful i am listening the whole time to it my new favourite disney movie i dont understand the critics at all i feel like the people did not understand the urgency of the messages it is conveying
Dec 14 2023,positive,this was a great movie i literally cant fathom how people are giving 13 stars animated disney musicals have been such misses recently especially with the quality of the music writing every song in this movie however is memorable and well written beautiful melodies and powerful lyrics i kept expecting a boring one of bad melody every time a new song came on but i was never disappointed the moral of chasing your dreams rather than forgetting about them and the special things that make you you was beautiful its better to have the chance to chase my dreams and fail than it is to never know what they are and never try dont believe the bad reviews give it a shot im a grown man and i am always the first to admit when i dont like these types of movies but this one made me cry
Dec 14 2023,negative,once again disney fails but at this point its not an exception but the norm    i took my daughter to watch this film and she seemed to enjoy parts but having watched just watched the boy and the heron the pervious day its clear that disney has completely lost the ability to tell and engaging story    i actually found myself agreeing with the villain and found the princess to be an insufferable brat    lets just hope that some day soon disney remembers to tell a story not sell a message
Dec 14 2023,negative,the plot is strange and the message that there trying to get of wishes coming true can be misleading the animation was good however the songs in the film werent very exciting and they were kind of blanduninteresting overall disney could of done much better for there 100 movie
Dec 14 2023,positive,i dont care what people say about this movie i loved it probably the best disney movie ive seen in a long time
Dec 14 2023,positive,i loved this movie from the goat and the star the songs the main character and i especially loved chris pine as the villain and his song was my fave classic disney movie with lot of easter eggs of previous films if you love disney you will love this
Dec 14 2023,positive,i honestly loved this movie it may not bring anything new to the table but i felt that it is a clear tribute to disneys beginnings filled with easter eggs and a familiar storyline it is fun and beautifully animated it connects with the roots of the industry and provides a link between the real life disney origin it travels beyond the screen in my opinion
Dec 14 2023,negative,worst movie weve seen since capt marvel
Dec 14 2023,negative,wish disney would go back to the good old days
Dec 14 2023,negative,i grew up on disney and i genuinely love disney but this is the worst disney movie i have ever seen the only part that was good was that the star looked cute everything else was awful and i started counting how many references to other disney movies were made rather than trying to follow the completely missing plot
Dec 13 2023,negative,this movie misses the point is trying to confuse the children by talking about star snd mr magnifico this will be another bust for disney 
Dec 13 2023,positive,my children absolutely loved this movie just loved it and i have several songs stuck in my head and cried more than once during the movie chris pine is a national treasure
Dec 13 2023,positive,the movie is very good also with the jokes i just think that the plot of encanto is repeated a little but with problems since every time there is an argument they start singing and the music is very good and there is one that almost makes me cry in the cinema in other words i give the movie a 1010
Dec 13 2023,negative,my youngest wanted to watch this we both wished wed watched something else in the end she basically just shrugged it off at the end     what the hell disney this was your thing and you fumbled it
Dec 13 2023,negative,could have been so much more graphics ruined it for me by looking  flat and cheap  characters were not  endearing and the songs instantly forgettable not one of disneys best
Dec 13 2023,positive,really really good movie everyone go see this movie its amazing
Dec 13 2023,negative,one of the worst animations ive seen it looks low budget wasnt expecting a film this bad from disney even other low budget animated films look better like way better this looks off and cheap very bad decision of doing this like this looks awful
Dec 13 2023,positive,very cute great songs loved star 
Dec 13 2023,positive,absolutely incredible one of my favorite disney movies of all time a message about hard work and the return of the original disney villain archetype so glad i saw this in theaters
Dec 13 2023,positive,overall a feel good disney movie maybe a little scary at times for the under 7 kids but ios disney movie and it is all ok in the end
Dec 12 2023,positive,cute movie perfect for kids  
Dec 12 2023,positive,love it so cute great meaning also must watch the credits especially if a disney fan
Dec 12 2023,positive,loved the characters the music and the story good family movie
Dec 12 2023,negative,its a disappointing movie i feel like i wasted my ticket and my time    not even to watch it at home on saturday on tv
Dec 12 2023,positive,beautiful story musical art talented were going to the award season
Dec 12 2023,negative,this movie was boring and cringe  couldnt wait for it to be over
Dec 12 2023,positive,it was a good holiday movie
Dec 12 2023,negative,not great not memorable at all
Dec 12 2023,negative,more disney trash they need to go back to their roots and tell family stories
Dec 12 2023,negative,a bland and forgetable movie that represents the current state of disney a once powerful empire became a nostalgia machine with nothing new to say on its 100th birthday
Dec 12 2023,negative,trash again i think the higher rating is ai generated
Dec 12 2023,positive,although it seemed to be trying to ride off the coat tails of encanto with its fast rap like lyrics it also was very catchy and the story was very good i even got chills at one point definitely would pay to watch it again
Dec 12 2023,negative,beautiful aesthetics and themes i should like but the movie still somehow fell flat
Dec 12 2023,negative,in wish 2023 the villain is a bad guy because he refuses to grant everyones wishes but thats actually reasonable do you know how much chaos there would be if everyone got their wish did they not see bruce almighty
Dec 12 2023,negative,weak plot no character development soso music this is a pale shadow of what a disney movie should be selfindulgent fan service movie written by a big corporation to sell plush toys youre better than this disney
Dec 12 2023,positive,very cute movie and family friendly  i like the representation of multiple racial backgrounds
Dec 12 2023,negative,the movie was basic and boring which saddened me because disney movies are usually engaging and fun 
Dec 11 2023,positive,such a metaphor for our present global situation  we need to believe in the purity of our own hearts and band together  quite in love
Dec 11 2023,positive,i honestly loved it so much  best disneys out in a while  the song the beauty the characters  it was amazing
Dec 11 2023,negative,the plot was difficult for young children to follow the songs were inappropriate for younger children  the animation of the star was a nothing more than a silly blob  finally the violence inflicted by the villain on the young much smaller and helpless heroine was not appropriate for any child viewing this film word of mouth will kill this latest release by disney
Dec 11 2023,negative,a very incongruent movie the heroine is the villain and the villain is the real hero
Dec 11 2023,positive,the movie was very fun with good songs i really liked the animation style and the movie itself flowed very quickly and nicely
Dec 11 2023,positive,great love letter to classic disney films not a fan of the animation style but the content was wonderful
Dec 11 2023,negative,confused story line poor sound
Dec 11 2023,positive,im not a movie musical person and this is what this movie is in addition its kind of different watching the characters sing  as with disney there is always a learning lesson the lesson in this movie of you being the one to fulfill your wish is a good one not sure if my 7 year old entirely understood that but he did enjoy the film
Dec 11 2023,positive,there is a total disconnect between criticsbox office sales and the quality of this movie its fantastic the music is incredibly moving its creative and funny and feels like a throw back to old school disney lots of easter eggs referencing classic disney movies it deserves so much more praise than it is recovering on par with encanto and moana in my opinion dont let the press dissuade you  go see this movie in theaters if you can
Dec 11 2023,negative,beautiful animated did not make up for a flat storyline and lack of emotional investment in the characters
Dec 11 2023,positive,love the movie  very meaningful
Dec 11 2023,negative,i dont like the story and characters but just one bright side the voice of the donkey i liked the voice actor still it wont change sorry this wont save the company
Dec 11 2023,positive,kids laughed a lot   animation style was really nice music was quite good but not moana level stuff or anything  villain consuming wishes to become more powerful is pretty cool
Dec 11 2023,positive,love the music and the story  my six year old granddaughter enjoyed it too
Dec 10 2023,positive,this was a beautiful disney movie the central plot of the movie embodied the 100 year anniversary of disney there were strong family values that were articulated throughout the movie we are all entitled to wish upon a star we are all entitled to happinesslove and compassion the central theme of wish was hope mankind will always prevail when hope exists
Dec 10 2023,positive,fun movie for the whole family i liked the nod to old disney movies the lead characters had great voices and there was some really funny moments
Dec 10 2023,positive,making your wish come true always keep wishing
Dec 10 2023,positive,very entertaining kept the 3 and 6 year old interested throughout
Dec 10 2023,positive,wish had the magic and wonder that i was hoping for the animation and design are beautiful and the voice acting helps bring some fun the music was able to maximize the inspiration and give audiences the hope that dreams can come true however the story did feel a bit rushed but was still entertaining and engaging this one you want to see in theaters though as the sound system does wonders for the music and the animation and i will happily watch this again and again
Dec 10 2023,positive,the movie is great and orignal dont hate it
Dec 10 2023,negative,weird overall it promotes poor values and immorality why would anyone make such a film but its worse than just that the scripting lacks the mix of sophisticated humor that disney once excelled in so were left with a movie that would only entertain young children but one that promotes immortality just makes no senseweird
Dec 10 2023,positive,the animation of the movie takes inspiration from some disney films from the 1940s50s ariana and chris delivered and there are so many catchy songs    i must say this film is a star
Dec 10 2023,negative,this movie feels more like a childrens movie than a film that the whole family can enjoy
Dec 10 2023,positive,most movies have gotten away from being truly a kids movie and throws in underlying adult concepts this was truly a kids movie with a positive message along with wonderful songs im on a spending freeze but the talking goat andor star i  could see myself purchasing a few for my nieces and nephews disney did a good job with this one
Dec 10 2023,negative,disney is running out of good ideas so it decides to teach kids to be stubborn and clueless
Dec 10 2023,positive,just a good overall fun movie to watch and i like the star
Dec 10 2023,positive,its a wonderful movie im a bit puzzled by some of the negativity
Dec 10 2023,negative,tribute or brainwashing is this a tribute or an attempt to use nostalgia to manipulate our principles the bad guy is good and the princess is good even though she steals etc etc etc sad sad sad movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,the movie was amazing great singing plot  characters a well spent evening at the movies seeing wish the kids loved the movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,wish is the great disney movie for all kids also it is an amazing tribute to all disney animated classics truly loved it by the way amazing singing voices
Dec 10 2023,negative,the idea for this movie was a wonderful one but the execution was poor the songs were largely dull and empty for animation movies with a short run time good ones use songs as a device to move the plot forward  this movie did not do that characters were not fully formed and because of that the audience didnt have much buy in for their hardships and successes i was largely disappointed but hope the kids still had a good time with it
Dec 10 2023,positive,great kid movie lots of music and action
Dec 10 2023,positive,absolutely lovely movie this is for the true disney movie lovers music was uplifting fun and catchy it took me back in time im ready to watch it again
Dec 10 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie took my 5 year old to see  it and we both were not disappointed i think this movie affected me more because there were so many cameos by other disney characters or hints to future charactersi totally digged the multiverse themes here the music was excellent and story building as always phenomenal cant wait to watch it again once it is out on disney next summer
Dec 10 2023,negative,distracting art style they tried to add lots of easter eggs for references to the classics but that only reminded us of how far disney has fallen in their ability to tell a captivating story music sounded nice although the lyrics were lazy but that was about it characters were shallow plot line was extremely simple and weak comedy was childish and forced little to no character development or anything just lazy as we walked out i asked my kids about what they thought 9 8 6 and 4 and they all said meh kinda boring come on disney do better we all know you are extremely capable
Dec 10 2023,positive,its not only a childs movie but a family movie and a chance to have a night out
Dec 10 2023,positive,i loved this movie i cant say enough positive things the story characters and the songs in the words of the little girl in the theater sitting next to me oh no its over already
Dec 9 2023,positive,i loved it i told my sister she has to see it this movie has a spiritual meaning behind it iykyk
Dec 9 2023,positive,we caught disneys wish movie the other day and honestly its such a winner for a chill family movie night its not trying to be all complicated  just a simple story thats easy to get into what we loved most is how likable the main character is they make the whole journey relatable and heartwarming its like youre right there with them    and lets talk about the music  its just really nice the tunes fit perfectly with whats going on and it kinda adds this extra awesome vibe to the whole thing not too fancy but just right    you know in a world of big flashy movies wish is like a cozy feelgood break it doesnt need all the craziness to be entertaining our family had a blast watching it and were totally giving it a thumbs up if youre into movies that leave you smiling this ones for you
Dec 9 2023,negative,i wish this movie was better   
Dec 9 2023,negative,quite possibly one of the worst disney movies that has ever came out storyline  boring  songs  boringnot catchy animation is giving early 2000s low budget
Dec 9 2023,negative,movie looked half finished and the soundtrack where both mid at best
Dec 9 2023,positive,beautiful movie my little girl loved it
Dec 9 2023,negative,bland asha is awful at least the villain is hot
Dec 9 2023,neutral,where do i even begin firstly its as if the film forgets what it is the plot feels like its trying to pull itself together whilst still finding a way to fail the plot points werent really great didnt really feel reason to care about some of the characters even because we barely get to know who these characters are like 0 reason for me to care for the main characters mother she did not do anything or me too along with the main characters friends and god her goat the goat is a whole other thing barely talked but at the same time tried to be funny irrelevant and pretty annoying overall this movie just had so many things wrong with it all the good cancels itself out i could go on but i wont  i wish this movie was better
Dec 9 2023,negative,boring give me something new disney this was the same old song and dance honestly the main character is uninteresting she really added nothing here the villain was evil for the sake of being evil actually which is unusual his wife was supposed to be evil too but they changed the narrative here the plot here is well they could have more to it but they didnt it was pretty basic if you want to want to know what it is some youtube videos have down to a t for kids this is decent entertainment but for adults who think this will be really boring since as stated this is just disney refusing to go out of their comfort zone
Dec 9 2023,positive,myself and my two children absolutely loved this movie and all the nods it gave to characters and stories of disneys past so good
Dec 9 2023,positive,a movie a must see beautiful graphics and sounds
Dec 9 2023,negative,disneys wish falls directly into all traps of modern animation  it checks all the boxes of bad modern animation lets review it     1 cliche villain    2 predicable plot     3 talking animals that seem cute but are actually mature    4 protagonist is bland and unintriguing     sadly this is the standard for cinema quality animation nowadays i dont think even children will enjoy it     however a huge saving grace for it is its soundtrack it is catchy melodic and generally pretty but thats really the only good thing about it other than that  total snooze fest 
Dec 9 2023,positive,great music loved the storyline overall great movie
Dec 9 2023,positive,any wish thats on your heart is a wish worth making that was a great message for adults and kids who have had their lives robbed by grief and disappointment we have the power to make our wish come true this was such a great story with a strong message to never give up on what you want for your life because when you do you lose a piece of yourself
Dec 9 2023,positive,great movie to take your grand kids too
Dec 9 2023,positive,the movie seen at the amc theatre was magical  the novelty items to choose from exceeded our imagination  the wish popcorn bucket of the star from the movie was a winner  it made the experience of seeing it with my daughter that much more entertaining  one thing we loved the most about the movie was the music  my daughter couldnt help but play center stage and dance
Dec 9 2023,negative,good soundtrack played out plot and story line not very original
Dec 9 2023,negative,it was entertaining but not good
Dec 9 2023,negative,this was awful  avoid at all cost songs are bad story is awful jokes dont land
Dec 8 2023,negative,hands down the worst disney film ive seen
Dec 8 2023,positive,wonderful movie for kids and all ages  good moral plot and music with lovely animation
Dec 8 2023,neutral,spoilers      rushed is the best way to describe it from asha deciding the king is wrong in less then 10 minutes to trying to steal wishes the next day with it feeling so rushed it was hard to make a connection to any of the characters could have been much better
Dec 8 2023,negative,and so i make this wishthat this had been a better film had a plot with actual character arcs and that it didnt have the worst songs of any disney animation also the heroine is kinda really the bad guy when you think about it
Dec 8 2023,negative,the story writing in this movie is a bit strange i still trying figure out what was the point of the movie
Dec 8 2023,negative,the movie was awful i can see why disney is losing their rear end on their movies these days im not taking my granddaughter to see another disney movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,the soundtrack was catchy and wonderful the message of the movie really drove home the importance disney places on doing whats right and supporting one another the grandfather in the movie was celebrating his 100th birthday just as disney celebrates theirs i get goosebumps thinking about all the awesome easter eggs and wonderful meaning behind the movie this was excellent
Dec 8 2023,positive,honestly speaking those who say this movie is a flop lost their spark a long time ago this movie is a beautiful movie which imo gives disney its magic back the ones saying its a bad movie lost their hopes and dreams a long time ago
Dec 8 2023,positive,i truly dont understand why a lot of people hate this film contrary to that disneys wish is a really good film and a beautiful tribute to the first 100 years of the walt disney company with its incredible animation terrific voice acting great music lovely story this film is undeniably fun and a marvelous work of art dont listen to the haters go see wish with an open mind hopefully you wont regret it
Dec 8 2023,neutral,very bland  too many cooks in this kitchen
Dec 8 2023,positive,i really liked this movie i disagree with the critics the story was original the songs were good and the voice over actors really delivered ive watched it twice in the theater
Dec 8 2023,negative,the only wish i could think of was the wish that i didnt actually spend money to see this movie what a colossal flop
Dec 8 2023,positive,im glad i saw it i didnt feel the art or the songs were top notch it felt like a low budget disney cartoon to me which it probably was but there is definitely enough that is good interesting and worthy of the canon to enjoy in this new disney entry
Dec 8 2023,negative,this movie is absolutely terrible
Dec 8 2023,negative,trash  very bad  would not recommend
Dec 8 2023,positive,my favorite animated disney movie in a long time
Dec 8 2023,positive,was very enjoyable and a learning moment loved it
Dec 7 2023,negative,stupid story line  disney failed to recreate the when you wish upon a star  only one decent song several awful ones
Dec 7 2023,positive,a beautiful nod to every disney classic with an equally beautiful soundtrack
Dec 7 2023,positive,what a great movie it was beautiful the songs were wonderful and a powerful message all three of us loved it
Dec 7 2023,positive,my family and i enjoyed movie kept a 3 year old interested
Dec 7 2023,positive,i liked the plot and how all the characters fit and the voice of the lead character fit with him very well d one
Dec 7 2023,positive,this film is wonderful magical heart warming some of the songs are instant hits others are slower growers but now i cant stop listening to the soundtrack i left the cinema and wanted to watch it again straight away there are definitely some powerful undertones to this movie arianna debose is phenomenal her voice is perfection asha is a brilliant addition to the disney family
Dec 7 2023,negative,i only enjoyed one of the musical numbers the story felt rushed and didnt really fit what disney used to deliver the characters were over the top and after seeing what the movie could have been i much would have had that then what i watched
Dec 7 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the film great storyline a few plot twists and the music was incredible
Dec 7 2023,positive,loved it the baby goat had all the funniest lines and my girls loved the singing
Dec 7 2023,positive,highly underrated and under promoted movie  might be my new top 3 music story all good  and star is so damn adorable  the messages in the movie are joy  hope and unity  would  and will  see again  
Dec 6 2023,negative,this movie was terrible huge disney fan and there was just nothing to like about this movie as many mentioned the animation and music were less than impressive weak story line forgettable characters way too many references to other disney movies which felt trashy just a huge let down and then to advertise it so aggressively why
Dec 6 2023,positive,great movie with good songs which my daughters have been twirling around the house singing all week our 4 year old said she likes it better than elsa and that is just about the greatest compliment any film can receive in our house
Dec 6 2023,positive,the songs were great the visuals are incredible and modern way better than the overthetop encanto   has a very simple plot likeable movie also for the conservatives  it doesnt feature gay characters dont be fooled by it negative reviews those are from nonwatchers
Dec 6 2023,negative,it was boring for the most part very predictable the main girl was trying to be funny but had no character she was acting like stupid
Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie celebrates the century of disney movies actually isnt spectacular didnt show a disney magical movie but there are a lot of disneys movies references and characters the seven dwarfs jungle book alice in wonderland the little mermaid etc the animation is between classic and 3d the music is a mix of all the disney movies music its  a nostalgic journey through all the disneys winks in this 100 years
Dec 6 2023,negative,the movie is ok but it lacks the disney magic of my childhood my kids say its a one time watch
Dec 6 2023,negative,it doesnt make the point and the plot is weak the villain is also not as formidable as they used to be it is more like a cartoon of a cartoon they end up using a cheap and unnecessary trick to defeat him    so we are talking about a way to defeat a villain that is not even gullible in the disney realm    the music also experienced and all time low not having a single part even slightly reminding me about the old school music in disney such as the goosebumps frozen caused me with let it go on the screen instead we have mediocre garbage like this is the thanks i get out of pitch and with amauteur music you can hear at any bar    the quality has dumped what happened to written stories with a logical defeat to the villain yes even between business parameters what happened to congruence and a little just a little common sense
Dec 6 2023,positive,the best 100 years of magic
Dec 6 2023,positive,the different disney personalities in each character was an awesome surprise
Dec 6 2023,positive,i love the main theme song for this movie this wish and how this movie demostrates disney fundamental value of following your heart to accomplish great things but an hour and 30 minutes to tell a story about a studio companys core value is very rushed and i wish they could stretch out the story board longer to learn more about the history or spend more time with the ashra valentino and star final score 810
Dec 6 2023,negative,lets throw stuff at the wall and try to make it stick dont waste your time with this acid trip of a disney movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,the star was the best part
Dec 5 2023,positive,it was a great musical about holding onto your dreams
Dec 5 2023,negative,someone must have fallen in love with chat gpt and prompted it to create a story around wishes a star a prince and a female hero on her cookie cutter journey wow that will be remembered as something i wish to forget
Dec 5 2023,negative,wow i wish i had not taken my daughter to see this i literally had to explain to her why granting everyone wish would not work if she was older i would have had her watch bruce almighty
Dec 5 2023,positive,wonderful movie i feel like we kinda returned to old fashioned disney movies with this one mybe thats because of the many references in this movie but it was a nice try on a villain like back then maybe they can do it next movie  the music was stunning and it was a beautiful story
Dec 5 2023,negative,remember kids for the price of one ticket to see this movie you can watch any disney movie you want with a disney  subscription
Dec 5 2023,positive,i liked it the animation quality is excellent and even reminiscent of classic disney style the villain is fantastically maniacal and flawed in so many ways it was predictable but fun
Dec 5 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it has items for the kids and parents  lots of easter eggs  different that the villian has 2 songs but the music is fantastic

Dec 5 2023,positive,ive watched this its like super awesome and great for wishes
Dec 5 2023,negative,i am a huge disney fan and usually even like the movies that dont go over well with others not this one though the worst part of the film is that the animation looks like it was made by the same people and technology that makes mickey mouse clubhouse it is a major step back on the animation side the story is forgettable the music is offensively annoying and there is nothing funny or memorable about the film
Dec 5 2023,positive,excellent  a must see and kids will absolutely love it  ignore the critics it is definitely worth seeing
Dec 5 2023,negative,i can see why the theater was empty felt like a move that should of went directly to dvdd
Dec 5 2023,neutral,im a women between 2025  still watching animations  cartoon     1 it is great to see that some characters are inspired by disney classic characters in this movie    2 i think that the songs in this movie is worse than frozen iii    3 the story us understandable but boring as it is nothing special always about saving the kingdom with love instead of watching this type of animation i personally prefer soul elemental frozen 2 3 and toy story    ps watched in cinemasaw no children watching this movie just 2 teens and all adults watching this movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,looked great in 3d story was kind of mid but still had that disney magic
Dec 5 2023,positive,all the easter eggs are so wonderful the movie is amazing and the characters are sweet and beautiful its a beautiful homage to the disney canon and telling the story of the star you will enjoy it
Dec 5 2023,positive,it is amazing and all the characters are good and ash is kind and i like star and it is worth the money we spent and it has good songs and it the best disney film in a long time
Dec 5 2023,positive,i never leave reviews but i hate the hate this movie is getting so much so in fact that i really felt the need to defend it i feel people are being way too harsh on a kids movie i bet every child that has seen it loved it i loved it too and i hope more disney adults go see it for themselves before listening to the negativity and refusing to see it     now the reason why i gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of what i know of the original script in the original script the star was supposed to be a shapeshifting boy who has a romance with asha and the king n queen were supposed to be a villainous couple idk why disney scrapped that because that would have had me and probably a lot of the haters absolutely feral in a good way we would have had our first couple that were villains and the romance between star and asha would have paid homage to the original disney princess movies which were romantically based and if i remember correctly i think asha was supposed to be the king n queens daughter too so we would have also gotten a good main character with secretly evil parents and a conflict between the family dynamic once the secret is out that would have been really interesting to see     however despite this loss and basing the rest of my opinion with what we were given i still enjoyed this movie very very much the animation was a blend of 2d and 3d and i loved that i loved that they did that to honor the two art styles of disney movies old and new it was different and beautiful the easter eggs were so fun to find and the music really wasnt that bad either i can see what people meant about it feeling as though the writers were trying to mimic lin manuel miranda in terms of pacing and rhythm but really theyre not as bad as a lot of people are saying they are i found the songs to be rather catchy even the villains song and you know what i like that it wasnt a dark sounding song but instead an upbeat one it made him different from other villains and their songs and also to me represented that evil isnt always going to come off as dark     people are always complaining about wanting something different and i think wish did a good job at that and now theyre complaining about wish should it have kept the original ideas yes absolutely but we cant change the past whats done is done and i think it was still done wonderfully all that matters is that the kids enjoyed it     810 and 45 for me     rant over xd
Dec 5 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie genuinely dont know why everyone hates it its great
Dec 5 2023,positive,me maybe animat should have gave it the animat seal of approval after all  my pikachu definitely and its really why dreams do come true when were with disney   story 1010  animation 810  characters 910  songs 910  overall 9610
Dec 5 2023,positive,movie was overall well paced and filled with easter eggs for disneys 100 the characters and story progression was pretty unpredictable for plenty beats making each step fun the art and animation wasnt anything amazing but it made certain animations pop which was nice  my main con with the movie is the main villain seemed genuinely concerned with how people saw him originally and really convinced he was helping but they really dont justify or explain well why he was so compulsive and afraid they never really touch what hes so afraid of happening just that he was driven out
Dec 5 2023,positive,id say it was pretty good as just a stand all disney film but as a 100 year anniversary it didnt deliver ok movie with some basic humor not amazing but not terrible
Dec 5 2023,positive,this movie culminates disney in a nutshell ariana debose is such a good actress for asha good story amazing songs a must see for all disney fans
Dec 5 2023,positive,in true disney fashion a message of hope follow your dreams never lose sight of them  loved it
Dec 5 2023,positive,music was good but the movie was slow
Dec 5 2023,negative,i used to love disney and held out hope for this one sadly it disappointed
Dec 5 2023,positive,if you like disney you will love this movie idk why so many people dont like it the animation is great the songs are good people these days just love to hate things
Dec 4 2023,negative,worst disney movie for sure
Dec 4 2023,negative,surprisingly weak animation and a tired unfocused story adds up to a boring trip down memory lane  an unintentional reminder of how far disney has fallen
Dec 4 2023,positive,first my middle daughter is screenwriter allison moore  i am always thrilled to see her work come to fruition  i loved this film and believe i would say the same even without my parental bias  it was entertaining and colorful  i remember my late husband her father and i taking the kids out to watch events like meteor showers comets eclipses and to gaze at the stars picking out constellations and special stars  that and made the scene at the tree and the wishing star very real and poignant  that scene and several others were very real despite being animation  the character development was well done throughout the movie  i enjoyed everything about the movie and would love to see a sequel
Dec 4 2023,negative,disney flop  poor story worse singing
Dec 4 2023,positive,very good message for those who dont believe in themselves
Dec 4 2023,positive,a fantastic return to disney classics  past few franchises frozen encanto etc have not had an actually disney villain just generational conflict and mean grandmas this film provides that disney antagonist we were all raised on one who quickly slips into madness and with greed for power unmatched by any other becomes their own undoing wish is a love letter to all the films that put walt disney animation studios on the map
Dec 4 2023,positive,really cute great origin story
Dec 4 2023,negative,the music was ok but the story was awful i mean a king built a kingdom from nothing kept the citizens safe gave them food free rent and he ends up being the bad guy if they want a different life go live somewhere else those are his lands
Dec 4 2023,negative,whats wrong with you disney
Dec 4 2023,positive,heard overwhelmingly negative things about the movie prior to taking my daughter 4 years old on a rainy afternoon plot was about as hollow as other recent disney movies a lot of background stuff that would have elevated the villain who was already decent enough to greater heights and added a lot more emotion his backstory is alluded too several times as if theres some big plot twist coming and it never does the kids seemed to like the songs and the scenes but its certainly no masterpiece overtime itll probably become quite forgettable if nothing else the book like drawing style of the animation is a nice change from the usual a bit jarring at first i will admit but charming all the same
Dec 4 2023,negative,boring but maybe the little ones will like 
Dec 4 2023,positive,what a great movie disney has chosen this film perfectly to celebrate one hundred years of magic
Dec 4 2023,negative,movie was not as good as past stories animation was ok and the songs could have used more work 
Dec 4 2023,positive,story is very simple but inspiring
Dec 4 2023,positive,such a cute uplifting movie  i already want to see it again
Dec 4 2023,positive,i loved it it was so good the music was on point the whole thing was the best
Dec 4 2023,positive,i took my granddaughter to see the movie we both enjoyed the movie very much cant wait till it comes out on dvd
Dec 4 2023,negative,an empty and emotionless film that references far more magical disney movies from the last century
Dec 4 2023,positive,my 5 and 6 year old sons enjoyed this film us parents did too there are two really particularly great songs in it i think really this film is for 6 or from 5 if they are more grown up and able to sit still it isnt as funny and exciting as some films like frozen and other pixar films but it was decent with a good moral message as usual with a disney film
Dec 4 2023,positive,grandkids loved  it builds self esteem  would recommend
Dec 4 2023,positive,my 10 yr old granddaughter  loved it i loved it as well even at my age its enjoyable to be in another world for awhile
Dec 4 2023,positive,great kids loved it good story good message and great music
Dec 4 2023,positive,super cute loved the story the characters and even the villain what a fantastic disney movie
Dec 4 2023,negative,made an account because i had to tell people how bad this movie is theres attempts to make the characters quirky and charming but theyre just annoying asha the main character is similarly supposed to be quirky and lol so spontaneous but the nervous energy of how the lines are delivered makes you feel on edge instead of charmed tons of worn out tropes weak plot but this would all be tolerable if not for the worst part of the movie the songs     i promise i have never heard worse songs in a disney movie the lyrics are awkward the rhythms of the melodies are so clunky and unnatural it makes you physically squirm the choruses are unmemorable and frankly just bad parents do everything you can to skip this stinker spend extra on that big christmas present to make up for it everyone will benefit more from it in the end
Dec 4 2023,neutral,i wanted so bad to love this movie i went in having high hopes and didnt even hear any outside opinions about the movie before seeing it unfortunately it was a let down the story was so bland and surface level it was boring the music was also terrible cringy frankly not memorable boring not catchy just overall bad music the only thing that kept me engaged and the only reason it gets 25 stars is all of the easter eggs to other movies this movie is a prequel to every other animated disney movie and it was interesting to figure that out and then find the easter eggs
Dec 4 2023,positive,just ignore the critics this was great with lots of throw backs and easter eggs
Dec 4 2023,neutral,animation fantastic as usual however the story was unusually weak
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie cant wait for its release on disney to watch again
Dec 4 2023,positive,enjoyed watching this with the family
Dec 4 2023,negative,the movie felt rushed from start to finish like there were entire scenes missing the writers never told me why i should care about the characters
Dec 4 2023,negative,dont bother just watch once upon a studio
Dec 4 2023,positive,very well done many many deep messages and many more easter eggs loves it
Dec 4 2023,positive,i loved the story behind the movie  it had a great beginning and end without spoiling the story for everyone glad i had the opportunity to view 5 stars all the way
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was a good movie that had lots of interesting easter eggs
Dec 4 2023,positive,im not sure where all the bad press comes from for this movie i think it is well done and while it may not carry the emotional gravity and complexity of some more recent hits like frozen moana or encanto it still is entertaining and has a soundtrack with some catchy broadwayesque songs in fact my 4 year old loves it and insists we play the soundtrack repeatedly the animation is different but it really is beautiful if you can see it in 3d and it doesnt bother you the animation absolutely pops in a cool way 
Dec 4 2023,negative,im sorry but how do people like this movie im going to side with the critics on this one a solid 410
Dec 4 2023,positive,the film was beautiful its colors the animation made me feel like i was reading a story that had a life of its own the songs and the soundtrack were amazing many thanks to all the workers of this beautiful film that took me back to my childhood
Dec 4 2023,positive,a must see disney movie
Dec 4 2023,negative,what a waste of time
Dec 4 2023,positive,a lot of similar elements to other disney movies a bit slow for my kids until the middle
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was a really good movie the start may have been a little slow but once the conflict is introduced the movie gets way better i found its physical comedy really funny with one scene having me have to hold in my laughter for an entire minute i also liked the disney classic feel of this movie the antagonist was evil for power and introduced as such early on in the movie just as the old disney villains were the protagonist was representative of the current generation of disney protagonists in that they had a quirky personality but are also leaders for their movie the end of the movie reminded me of a disney firework show finale which i adored there were also many allusions relating to past disney movies whether it be through speech or action or even a representative character the minor problem i had with this movie was that the animation style was a little offputting when the movie started i thought it was going to bother me the entire way through the movie however as the movie progressed i began to appreciate the animation more and more especially when magic occurs all in all this movie was captivating and enjoyable it may not have the deep complex and emotional plot and characters that many have come to expect from an animated disney movie however as a celebration of 100 years of disney animation i think it does well in achieving its goal of providing an entertaining movie for everyone to enjoy
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was a fun movie and good for kids
Dec 3 2023,positive,its a cute heartfelt movie that promotes hope in people love the music score too beautiful voices
Dec 3 2023,positive,i love this film its a tribute to all classic disney with many easter egg but thats not all the animation and the graphics are incredible the songs is what we would expect for a disney  amazing and the story is really nice we never get bored during the film really really good to see
Dec 3 2023,positive,what a great show  very uplifting message to always believe in your dreams
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece its a great movie for disneys 100 years of magic please watch this movie its a great
Dec 3 2023,positive,perfectly fine disney holiday treat chris pine is a hot ursula
Dec 3 2023,negative,not a good movie feels artificial at his full it mesagge is so numb and is tedius songs that not fit the intention of the movie a villain that is not a villain and various characters that dont add anything to the movie pretty animation boring and artificial story
Dec 3 2023,positive,gorgeously animated heartwarming story fantastic music loved every minute it was like a feast for the eyes 
Dec 3 2023,positive,fun beautiful scenery catchy songs
Dec 3 2023,positive,in recent years it has become trendy for everyone to criticize the walt disney company as much as humanly possible in many cases it is justified but these criticisms are unfounded regarding wish disneys tribute film to their 100year animation legacy this is a movie that provides disney fans with everything they have been asking begging and wishing of the studio for years it is a beautifully animated original story that is all heart with no pandering and is neither a sequel nor a remake since the movie is also an homage to the disney animation of the past it is packed with subtle easter eggs that only true disney fans will notice and are not obnoxiously in your face like some of their previous attempts with wreckit ralph 2 or chipn dale rescue rangers in fact this movie was so entertaining that it got me thinking about the characters on a deeper level than the writers may have even intended long after i left the theater    as previewed in the trailers wish tells the story of asha an ordinary girl living in the extraordinary kingdom of rosas where the peoples wishes are regularly extracted from their souls and given as offerings to sorcerer king magnifico in the hopes that he will one day grant them asha has a botched interview to be magnificos new apprentice with the somewhat selfserving motivation of granting her grandfathers wish for his 100th birthday when she learns that magnifico has no intention of granting most of the wishes he collects instead he keeps them safe in his castle so their owners can forget them and not have to experience the pain of longing for something that will never happen the way that he did in his childhood magnifico and asha have different perspectives on what is best for rosas though neither of them is entirely wrong learning the truth prompts asha to summon a magical wishing star with the potential to return the peoples wishes rousing magnificos wrath and turning him into a classic disney villain when he is corrupted by dark magic from a forbidden book    there are many things to love about this movie in addition to the unique plot that is inspired by disneys history of heartfelt musicals about chasing your dreams rather than an old fairy tale the cgi animation is blended with a unique watercolorinspired filter to give the movie more of a classic look that is reminiscent of the handdrawn films of the past that many people grew up with myself included watching it on a big screen enhances this effect through a subtle canvaslike paper texture underneath every frame that is virtually invisible when viewing it on a smaller screen there are also faint outlines around each character and object creating a similar effect to the first season of sofia the first many visuals throughout the film weave in references to memorable scenes from the animated disney movies of the past hundred years including princess auroras enchanted dress the glowing green hands that ripped out ariels voice the fairy godmothers cloak and wand and the opening title screen of snow white and the seven dwarfs the film is a visual feast for anyone who has ever enjoyed a disney movie in the past it even includes a subtle nod to disney television animation    one unique element that wish introduced is a love interest for the villain there was so much potential for queen amaya to provide a compelling story of heartbreak and the power of true love that had never been done in a disney movie before unfortunately this opportunity was squandered by making her a onenote macguffin who showed very little remorse toward magnificos transition to evil or the inevitable punishment that resulted from it as a longtime fan of sofia the first i have been very compelled by the idea of a story in which an innocent maiden is able to reform an evil sorcerer but this was not that story i hope that the inclusion of a love interest for the villain can lay the groundwork for more complex relationships in future disney movies though amaya falls flat as a character i loved that both asha and magnifico wanted to do what was right for rosas and could have easily switched roles as the hero and villain of the story if their circumstances had been different asha initially wanted to benefit her own family and performed some questionable actions when she decided to betray magnifico likewise magnifico was misguided by his traumatic past and thought he was doing what was right for rosas and might have succeeded if amaya had gotten through to him    wish stands as a refreshing departure from the wave of criticism facing disney in recent years the movie offers fans a heartfelt and original story free from the overbearing references that have characterized some of the studios past works the homage to disneys animation legacy is woven into the films dna evident in its beautifully animated original story and subtle easter eggs that remain true to the spirit of disney the films unique visuals blending cgi animation with a watercolorinspired filter provide a classic look reminiscent of handdrawn films of the past furthermore wish introduces unique elements such as a love interest for the villain hinting at the potential for more complex relationships in future disney movies despite some missed opportunities in character development the films exploration of the conflicting perspectives of its main characters adds depth and nuance to the narrative leaving viewers pondering the story long after leaving the theater overall wish serves as a testament to disneys ability to evoke nostalgia while forging new ground offering a visually stunning and thoughtprovoking experience for audiences
Dec 3 2023,positive,i thought it was great and loved all the songs
Dec 3 2023,positive,wish is a fantastic story about finding your inner strengh the songs are super catchy and fun the animation looks great   and is a wonderful celebration of disneys past and present the story tucks at your hardstrings and the main charakter can shine on her own without beeing overpowered by the side charakters  star is a adorable new charakter hope to see him again the references to previous movies are subtle and dont take away from the movie overall an awesome experience
Dec 3 2023,positive,i thought disney got it right on this one i loved the message it gave our kids to go for their dreams and to recognize the light within themselves i loved it
Dec 3 2023,negative,underwhelming i like the idea of disneys 100 anniversary movie being about wishing on a star but this fell flat the goat had some funny lines but not much from anyone else the female protagonist character type at disney for the past 10 years is tiring from rapunzel to anna moana to mirabel and raya this new asha feels identical the quickly adorkable personality is overused and lazy on filmmakers not every girl is clumsy and insecure and quirky disney hasnt made me eager to watch a lot of newer movies and wish was worse than what i expected
Dec 3 2023,negative,absolutely terrible movie i feel like someone allowed ai to write this tripe plot makes no sense characters were unlikeable save your money
Dec 3 2023,positive,the words in the songs were irrelevant and long  the moxie elements were beautiful well song interesting take on wishes  dont just wish them but also pursue them i also recommend pursuing with praying for real assistance from  the creator and his minionsangels are the best
Dec 3 2023,positive,pretty good disney movie beautiful songs and good villain id recommend it
Dec 3 2023,positive,my wife and i saw wish with our son and youngest grandson we loved the storyline and had a great outing together i would definitely recommend
Dec 3 2023,negative,ugh dont pay for this
Dec 3 2023,negative,just okay great idea poor music choices
Dec 3 2023,negative,not as good as encanto since some of their songs are boring
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie songs are not annoying i like it for my kids and i
Dec 3 2023,negative,this film was beautiful to watch but what is wrong with the sound mixers you have all this talent and you can barely hear them over the backround music and most of the lyrics are lost you have the incomparable ariana debose and you miss most of her in the backround noise
Dec 3 2023,negative,past the hour and i was already wishing movie to finish it is boring and too many useless characters inserted with the diversitysupport role excuse some others looked visually recycled animation style is odd too many dialogues and few action for kids to follow the positive note is the reference to disney magic the star character and the main song overall is meh for the disney everyone loves i expect great storytelling that makes you cry or laugh big time hitting home with deep emotions this one didnt make it for me
Dec 3 2023,positive,the story was amazing and there was a lot of easter eggs in the movie ill probably watch it again
Dec 3 2023,positive,cute film for kids  for some younger children gillian maybe scary
Dec 3 2023,negative,the movie runs on nostalgia and the celebration of the 100 year mark with little else supporting its foundation wish suffers from a contrived storyline full of forgettable characters a promising villain magnifico loses interesting character qualities in favor of an additional dark gimmick the comedy is routinely hamfisted throughout the movie the music is expectedly lacking given the pop artists placed at the helm and do no justice for disneys musical legacy
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was a very cool movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,i liked the movie overall it reminds me of an amalgamation of references to classic disney films i can dig the nostalgia so long as quality products are made
Dec 3 2023,positive,i liked the storyline a lot but the songs needed some work animation was amazing
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie should have been called disney 100 as it was a tribute to the last 100 years of disney  its a cute story with great music but the real treasure is in the millions of easter eggs a must see for all disney fans
Dec 3 2023,positive,great animation music and story
Dec 3 2023,positive,its no tangled but the movie has a solid story and great songs that kept me entertained it was a fun watch
Dec 3 2023,negative,meh just wasnt great  disappointed i used my gift card to watch
Dec 3 2023,negative,a lot of unfulfilled potential the film sped through all the setup and lingered far too long on the conflict that getting to the ending wasnt a reward it was just a relief unusually dark for way too long and the comedy was so sparring that nothing was providing hope within plot wish was too hyperfocused on its easter eggs that it forgot that it should have been its own thing
Dec 3 2023,positive,i love the movie message is great it is fun to watch i also have a great time relating back to previous disney movies that i have watched for the past 50 years
Dec 3 2023,negative,villain wasnt really a villain the mc was more the criminal than he was songs were okay if your looking for more boss girls that dont need no man then every disney movie for the last decade is for you this is more of the same was forced to watch this because godzilla film was broken i honestly wish i went home instead but i already bought the soda
Dec 3 2023,positive,nice to see disney make a movie that is getting back to a simple kidfriendly story with no hidden agendas the numerous call backs to old disney films was fun to watch the songs were good although sometimes seemed out of place all in all a nice movie that will be enjoyed again
Dec 3 2023,positive,despite clichéd elements and underdeveloped characters wish is a beautifully animated and enjoyable tribute to disneys centennial
Dec 3 2023,positive,good movie but i wouldnt rate it a top disney movie   family still enjoyed it though would recommend watching
Dec 3 2023,positive,it has its ups and downs disneys wish has a great foundation it was built on great watercolor visuals great easter eggs and an alan tudyk goat unfortunately thats really about it ariana debose is great in her role as asha and chris pine is great in his dorkyintimidating villain role but this movie was way too rushed the pacing is a little off the dialogue was meh but my biggest disappointment was the soundtrack we have about three good songs but the rest are just forgettable better than disneys last venture strange world but still a very middle tier movie of disneys
Dec 3 2023,negative,waste of 90 minutes music was pretty bad comedy was very cringe movie seemed forced and rushed
Dec 3 2023,negative,i had a family emergency and was unable to attend  unfortunately fandango wouldnt give me a refund so i lost 35 bucks due to their policy which is ridiculous
Dec 2 2023,positive,going to be a hidden gem of a disney 100 movie
Dec 2 2023,negative,was able to walk out so only wasted 45 minutes disney is not worth the spend anymore
Dec 2 2023,positive,i loved all the nods to the original movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,really great movie no propaganda or woke agenda being shoved down your throat but still inclusive with a great messagethat you can make your own dreams come true wonderful music funny cute movie very enjoyable one of the better movies from disney in a while
Dec 2 2023,negative,horrible we really wanted to like it but the kids were confused and honestly so were we not meant to be a disney classic
Dec 2 2023,negative,horrible movie what happened to disney
Dec 2 2023,positive,when you wish upon a star theres no difference who you are anything your heart desires will come to you from the paraphrased opening lyrics of the iconically symbolic song its become a narrative foundation across walt disneys animated classics inspiring young dreamers to follow where their hearts lead this recurring thematic strive may have defined the canonship of how speculatively connected the films supposedly are not only wishful dreams but along with few other traits from structurallywise to uniquely supportive characters and envious villains  in most cases and types of music involved in a magical mixture the films became timeless classics that delight generations of enchanted families over beloved characters stirring arcs blessed by wondrous animation continuously evolving accompanied by unforgettable music these animated films are the definitive backbone to the storytelling company  aside from cinematic innovations held mostly well in the past century from decent minimum to cherished greatness by evoked memories per artistically stated the latest classic has been a century in the making theres a loving line of agreement when wish commemorates the past century in brilliant heartening ways    honestly it hasnt been this much anticipating since frozen ii nor the princess and the frog for an original classic while others in between were welcomed right away and rightly presumed theyd be enjoyable which they were some much better than others wish seems to be the flagship behind disneys 100 years celebration routinely released on thanksgiving weekend per tradition tributing its preceding wonders from shorts simplicity to features connective traits and animated transitionally between its current computer graphics and watercolors flowed into the enabled motions that wouldve been limited if traditionally drawn at that point its already been foretold this is going to be a great addition to the canon library heightened by the music perfectly giving the passionate impression emphasizing the central theming being dimensionally realized and embodied into its own narrative than just a cherished ideological motif    given the current era attempting to creatively branch off onto different terrains of storytelling with some being specific throwbacks within the modern slates while still retaining the wishful ideal disneys 62nd animated films reminiscence goes further back towards the classic era as felt in the writing modernly spun through the nuanced wellrounded characterization and subtle designs directors chris buck tarzan frozen and fawn veerasunthorn in her directorial debut with jennifer lee and allison moore obviously told the story with the past films in mind to fuel the elemental tribute in creative ways that not only retains the original impressions but also poised to draw memories along down the lane it throws back under the recognizably specific form fairly sure they were having fun through dialogue resemblances then when it comes to the overarching story is their collaborative retrospect being thoughtfully penned as were witnessing the unveiling of the roots to the beloved stories its been factually acknowledged that the consisting crew has seen all 61 films therefore not only we resonate but also encouraged to put the pieces together to find how justifiably nuanced the story is with enriching hefts given    of course the integral expectancy towards a disney animated film is the musical impact  unless the storytelling type differs and it just astounds with emotional rise the songs are extraordinarily spirited with contagious beats by catchy memory and magnetic amassing intuitiveness adjacent to the performative initiation it starts with the energetic welcome to rosas as the opening number then soulfully resets beautifully before building up with enchanting upbeats to the uplifting climax purely kinetic as the songs synergistically volume up while the closing number a wish worth making feeds off of the heightened emotions stirred from the climax for unexpected profoundness julia michaels and benjamin rice did an incredible job musically contributing to the overall written assignment before michaels sung through the credits with tone and words backed up by surprising visuals which evoked fond memories of interacting with the stories that greatly inspired the wonder beheld  and in remembrance for those who took us through those stories then frequent collaborative score composer dave metzger also reflected primarily from his experience to viewed knowledge of the films beforehand into the score that recalls certain sequences via structural tropes with integrated familiar notes as if the music from the past gotten mixed seamlessly    the idealness in the efforts stems from where our wishes originated or as cinderella says that a dream is a wish your heart makes and amid the belief if your heart is in your dreams no request is too extreme when you wish upon a star as dreamers do everyone worked on this film wholeheartedly with utter passion from written and gorgeously animated appreciation to musical recollection enhanced by topnotch performances exceeding prompted expectations whilst embracingly acknowledging the legacy each of their characters are continuing ariana debose charismatically stands out the most as asha followed by chris pines amazing capability delivering the brewing maliciousness in king magnifico then alan tudyk is a comedic fulfillment as the talking goat valentino and angelique cabral morally soothes as queen amaya who worries where magnificos fear of the magical unknown is sinking him also among the cast of characters are ashas friends cleverly designed after the seven dwarves with modernized persona nicely embodied and performatively excelled    wish is pure disney magic commemorating the past century in brilliant heartening ways passionately uplifted and beautifully executed as well animated to the amount of wishing upon a star it brightly polishes its wishful pioneering position that sets off towards granting the events in previous films warming hearts in its loving embrace therefore slightly changing the cherished perspective towards revisiting the classics and referring back to how this film provided the granting source another storytelling achievement that captures the essence of disney through evoked fond memories which production been encouraged to project those through their efforts while this is highly ranked as one of the years best animated films and of course joining the librarys fivestar tier it unfortunately doesnt have enough pixie dust to surpass spiderman across the spiderverse that swung with heavier focus but on its own wish is wonderfully entertaining valued over its purest nostalgic effect even if cynically criticized with not enough momentum to truly define how gracefully this classic was presented a
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved wish great message good for all ages thought animation could have been better but with that being said everyone should see this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,we loved it totally recommend
Dec 2 2023,positive,a nostalgic roller coaster from start to finish with many throwbacks reminding us why disney has been the soul of movies for 100 years the end credits have a beautiful scene too    anyone not enjoying this movie clearly missed the many many easter eggs and homage to previous movies which filled the whole families hearts
Dec 2 2023,positive,another great disney story must see for little ones
Dec 2 2023,positive,best one ever funny and magical
Dec 2 2023,positive,what a great film to put out for 100 years of disney magic
Dec 2 2023,positive,wish tells a smooth and yet appealing story that is provided by a bunch of amazing songs even though a few are slightly over the top its cast ensemble builds on a strong main character despite asha appearing genereic from time to time the villain magnifico adds a lot of essence to the film in a brilliant manner and so does his wife however quite a few of the supporting characters seem rather superficial instead of revving up the chemistry of the film the animation is beautifully referencing both disneys power of nostalgia and innovation the same applies to the general atmosphere although it partly lacks the magic you might expect  all in all wish is a good film that mostly grows out of its weaknesses but doesnt remain flawless
Dec 2 2023,negative,zzz the plot the characters the animation some music sounds good    magnífico is the hero of this movie 
Dec 2 2023,positive,lots of references to the old disney moviesso touching
Dec 2 2023,negative,terrible music boring story
Dec 2 2023,negative,a complete failure of the original disney vision
Dec 2 2023,positive,movie was great my daughter loved the music and  the story
Dec 2 2023,positive,i dont know what the haters are on about i saw this movie with a friend today and loved everything from the artstyle to the characters the songs which i am a very hard critic about and the story about making your own wishes come true instead of waiting around for them to be fulfilled for you as a 100 year celebration this is a great movie and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone child or adult
Dec 2 2023,positive,i did not what to expect but i loved this movie  i think it needed to be marketed more  i want to go see it again i got goosebumps several times and happy to see genuine storylines again
Dec 2 2023,negative,did not peek my interest at all disney is out of touch with the average american
Dec 2 2023,positive,critics are so stuck up they have lost vision this is a magical 100 anniversary tribute the music is fantastic my family downloaded the soundtrack and went back for a second time to sing along any true disney fan will love this movie with scene to scene easter eggs which warm your heart and with nostalgia references from cinderella tarzan moana aladdin the list goes on and it was so fun the second time trying to catch all the little sly mentions through the entire movie asha has a lovely voice and is such an inspiring character full of gumption and true grit it might not be the most original movie but thats the point it an ode to the classics and the beloved stories its a memetic play on the movies that disney has created over a century we loved it also the ending has a truly tearful ode to wishing upon a star the true essence of childhood wonder and imagination in fact we came home and my daughter wanted to look up to the sky and wish upon the stars that same night it was truly lovely to see how my little one love it and how i loved it as well
Dec 2 2023,negative,pretty bad doesnt explain much at the beginning ny child got bored really quick and only perk up for the singing wanted to leave early that it was so bad
Dec 2 2023,neutral,not up to the old disney standards story wasnt compelling there was no character development and the animation especially the backgrounds was subpar would spend hard earned money to take the family to this one wait it out for streaming shouldnt be long 
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is a movie that is definitely designed to be a love letter to those who grew up with disney stories in their life i absolutely loved it it brought back the classic disney stories that i loved and found nostalgic however it also added the joy of the newer generation of disney stories that model female heroism it is jampacked full of easter eggs and nods to past disney films which makes viewing incredibly fun for a disney nerd like myself the feeling of joy and hope that are brought from this movie make viewing the viewing experience wonderful  i will definitely be rewatching and listening to the soundtrack over and over i highly recommend watching and giving this movie a try whether you are returning to disney or your its your first film
Dec 2 2023,positive,started slowcute movie nonetheless
Dec 2 2023,negative,disney is trash now walt and roy are rolling in their graves seeing what their company has become
Dec 2 2023,negative,nothing special or new kind of boring  waste of time and money
Dec 2 2023,positive,ive seen this movie twice now and will likely go to see it again     the first time i saw wish i was braced for the sucker punch political undertone that just doesnt belong in a fairytale it never came by the time i was relaxed enough to enjoy the movie music and easter eggs i had really missed most of the film    i went to see the movie again last night confident in the knowledge that it is a traditional disney movie with a generally wholesome message while there are opportunities to spot potshots at the brand if you really want to see them the movie is not a charged platform    giving wish a second watch was like giving a new album a second listen and i loved it there are plenty of nostalgic throwbacks the music is catchy and the story is sweet it is true to the genre that is disney in a halffilled theater the movie ended with applause from the audience    is this the most important movie ever made no although it is very important to the genre is it the most engaging story of all time no it is not even the most engaging disney story of all time it does feel a bit forced at times this is however a wonderful throwback to the heart of disney and deserves the attention of its loyal base as it pays homage to the man himself    after being repelled by disney movies for the last couple of years i will likely go and see this movie a third time disney is still able to create content that is consistent with walts vision and legacy and in line with the brand im happy to reward that by contributing to the box office for wish
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie will raise your selfesteem while entertaining you
Dec 2 2023,negative,honestly its so bad that i am reviewing on rotten tomatoes for the first time no character development songs are just rubbish and all cartoon looks unfinished truly the waste of money and time
Dec 2 2023,positive,we brought our young teenage grand kids to wish as a return to the theater we loved the movie and left with a smile on our faces i in particular was very pleased with the animation style along with the music it was wonderfully done and very enjoyable to watch
Dec 2 2023,positive,i loved this movie the homages to previous disney classics and the easter egg hunt was fun for me as an adult the message that if you wish for something you have to work for it and not just wait for someone to grant it for you was a strong one music was on point and animation was a fun blend of old and new styles
Dec 2 2023,negative,as the world keeps turning disney keeps burning money by the boatload
Dec 2 2023,positive,entertaining basic disney tunes age appropriate and thankfully no injection of social experimental messages  way too light on disney film references especially since is supposed to be an homage to disney as a whole
Dec 2 2023,negative,horrible movie the classic evil villain is the only character with common sense
Dec 2 2023,negative,disney lost it if we can be honest  this movie should have been really special going all out but sadly it failed  maybe in an other 100 years we will see the real magic again
Dec 2 2023,negative,dont turn the villain to a hero or a hero to a villain and stop with the bots giving good ratings to this conterintuitive disney film
Dec 2 2023,positive,my niece loved it the songs were very well done the pacing of this movie was on point and the villain was my favorite part not over the top evil but very developed
Dec 2 2023,negative,personally i didnt like it visuals werent too good it was boring and i literally almoust fell asleep during it it was that boring the ensing wasnt cool there were too many characters and itgot boring really fast
Dec 2 2023,negative,not entirely terrible but it should have gone straight to streaming wish is best described as an overly long episode of sophia the first
Dec 2 2023,negative,it was awful like even tho im a adult i probably wont get in to it but i watch it and was awful it wasnt that good this movie is more like for 3 year olds that pretty much it i give it a rating 110
Dec 2 2023,negative,disney use to do great works   this had some good moments but i miss the classic animation and classic way they told stories
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was neither as good as i hoped nor as bad as i feared it was okay
Dec 2 2023,positive,a great disney movie that honors the 100 year legacy of the studio fantastic characters and music deserves better than all the meaningless hate its recieved
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie is awesome i want to watch it
Dec 2 2023,positive,i love this movie and get a bit confused as to why others hate itit brings back all the fantastic nostalgia of watching classic disney films as an adult and yet is just scary enough to still be manageable for little ones yet balanced with the sweet and charming sidekickhumor we all remember from classics like mulan or pocahontas    i enjoyed the songs but do feel like we needed a bit more speaking moments between some of them also loved the wide array of character types heartening back to snow white yes its heavyhanded but cant we all agree that the names of the original dwarves was just as obvious     id say watch it twice once to get the snapjudgment out of your system and again to actually suspend reality for a moment and be a disney kid once more     3d is the way to go for this movie the animation pops much more and the quality of the 3d is stunning
Dec 2 2023,positive,awesome movie especially for disney lovers tons of references to disney classics
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved all the references to other disney films definitely a must watch if youre a huge disney fan
Dec 2 2023,positive,typical disney slow to get started then formulaic make for merchandising to kids
Dec 2 2023,negative,i was disappointed it didnt feel like a disney movie the storyline was lacking the music was not up to par at all i was hoping for a lot more
Dec 2 2023,positive,i love the movie loved all the hidden easter egg like peter pan the poisoned apple the hidden mickeys and many more and my favorite songs are at all costs and this wish reprise
Dec 2 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant film the animation style really brings back the classic disney nostalgia
Dec 2 2023,positive,yet another wonderful movie in the tradition of disneys wish upon a star  my three grand daughters ages 5 10 and 12 all loved it
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was cute and beautiful my 5 year old daughter and her friend enjoyed the movie and let out many giggles the critic reviews are needlessly harsh towards a movie for kids that does what it is supposed to  entertain both girls liked seeing the references to other movies and adored asha star and valentino 4 stars because the first 20 minutes are a little lacklustre and there are other disney movies that do a better job of catering to children while also better entertaining adults
Dec 1 2023,negative,disney spent a whole movie being nostalgic rather than creating a good production they should have done a short movie like pixar do before wish started to play tribute to their centenary instead of creating a movie of easter eggs
Dec 1 2023,positive,despite what the naysayers and supposed film critics say this is a really good film and manages to hit that warm cosy  spot inside like any good disney film does i entered the cinema with trepidation due to the negative reviews online but my young daughter was excited to see the new disney fair  however i neednt have worried as this was pure unadulterated good vs evil in the best traditional disney style this emulates classic disney of a bygone era from the moment we are presented with the storybook beginning to the happy ending that leaves you feeling satisfied hopeful and thinking that everything is going to be all right the animation is beautiful a new hybrid style of old and new  recreating the best of disney films from the past with beautifully painted whimsical backgrounds to bright and vibrant characters and for maturer aficionados of disney there were many easter egg references to the plethora of previous disney movies  these references added an extra level of enjoyment throughout the film as you recognised nods to the past all in all this is a very enjoyable movie does it reach the upper echelons of moana and frozen not quite but not many films do but what it does do is celebrate the old and new with that warm nostalgic feeling of disney past and for younger fans  my daughter loved it and left the cinema singing the songs
Dec 1 2023,negative,disney stay away from my kids    if rotten tomatoes would let me i would have rated it a 0
Dec 1 2023,positive,i love the movie  stand up for what you believe in and family over all 
Dec 1 2023,negative,its a movie that tries way too hard to give nod to the disney past but fails to develop a real story too much is filled in by horribly written songs that make no sense other than to try and fill in some of the story  as a huge disney fan i loved the nods to the past but the lack of story development really made this one of the worst disney movies in a century
Dec 1 2023,positive,from music to graphics this was absolutely stunning the first disney movie in over a decade that actually left a smile on my face would recommend even if you have issues with disney this is a must see no hidden or subliminal messages that i could fined just a pure good watch thats family friendly
Dec 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed the music especially knowing what i know now and the numerous easter eggs to acknowledge all the prior disney movies the extra scene after the credits was so heart warming the only thing that bothered me was the manly baby goat voice
Dec 1 2023,negative,loved the style of animation but the story was not good it sometimes felt incoherent or incomplete songs were not memorable villain song was too upbeat and didnt deliver  it may be fun for little kids because of the animals and colors that is all they care to see anyway
Dec 1 2023,positive,i have so many questions about this giving up your wish to the king set up if theres one song that id recommend its im a star i dont think kids could memorize it
Dec 1 2023,positive,truly underrated movie fantastic storyline great music amazing animation 
Dec 1 2023,negative,disney is seriously struggling now fans have asked for a new story or a nonsequel film and it still fails to capture the disney magic wish is a nothing film that has little heart poor concepts and the animation is even a letdown the message being taught is empty and nothing about the film is going to make old fans come back to disney
Dec 1 2023,positive,acutally i think the flim was pretty good i disagree with ohter people about this movie everyone on the disney wiki said this movie was trash but for me this movie is so good that i love it and its pretty good
Dec 1 2023,negative,didnt know disney could produce something this bad
Dec 1 2023,positive,a lot of disney movie nothing memorable only 2 songs seemed pleasant to me and the second act bored me to the point of almost falling asleep the idea is not bad but the execution was terrible this movie had much more to offer
Dec 1 2023,negative,the villain is confusing i get that hes revealed to be greedy and is supposed to be like the old disney villains who are just iredeemable but honestly it almost seems forced like they wanted to make him the misunderstood type but they said screw it about halfway through    the main character is just the same as every other single disney princess that has come out in the last decade which was fun for tangled but it was boring by the time frozen came out    i dont know i feel like it could have been good but the writers just stopped caring about halfway through
Dec 1 2023,negative,please just dont see this movie its a movie where almost none of it works the plot you can see coming from miles away the songs are pisspoor and everyone but the villain are boring characters with very little to actually define them as characters on top of everything the movie is unnecessarily obsessed with cramming in as much references to previous disney films that isnt an excuse for the film to be poorly done    this is disney at nearly their worst if you want to show your kids a good movie then show them almost any other disney flick this movie isnt worth your time nor your kids time
Dec 1 2023,negative,the animation style was neat and thats about the only positive thing i can say i spent most of the runtime cringing through the songs and wondering if this movie was written by ai or just woefully overworked and underexperienced writers     im struggling to think of ways wish didnt fail the plot made no sense the characters were dull and soulless the tone was wildly inconsistent  the songs were strange and repetitive jokes rarely landed and the dialogue was so canned and full of references it seemed more like a bad parody than an official disney movie its also deeply unpleasant to hear actors that i know  can sing be so heavily autotuned  it was actively painful more often than not    worst of all out of the handful of kids i know who went to see this movie none actually enjoyed it some were confused and asking questions the whole time a few young ones were scared of the villain and crying and asking to leave and the rest were just bored and therefore chaotic the one thing a disney movie should do is occupy young children for an hour or two but wish doesnt manage even that im glad i only had to sit through it with a relatively calm set of kids but i feel awful for all the parents who had to get through it with their more rambunctious kiddos     really if disney wanted a showcase anniversary celebration i wish hah theyd just stuck with a new fantasia ill be steering everyone i know away from this one
Dec 1 2023,negative,i really wish that disney could make movies again but they all just all fall short save your time and  people and go see something else
Dec 1 2023,positive,love it my 7 year old nephew rated it as 1010
Dec 1 2023,neutral,i think wish had potential but overall it just lacked background and context random things happened and most of the time you didnt even know why
Dec 1 2023,negative,i only wish disney will make something good in the next years and not a boring movie
Dec 1 2023,negative,this movie was nothing special or anything magical that its trying to be i was mostly apathetic throughout the experience and i cringed at a few parts disney is loosing its magic and if im being honest they have lost their touch its about time for the house of mouse to shut down after 100 years of making movies
Dec 1 2023,negative,just super subpar songs are mediocre characters never as engaging as you would hope storyline rather blah encanto moana and frozen absolutely kick this movies

Dec 1 2023,negative,another terrible disney movie bad guy is really the good guy and the hero is really the villain dumb plot
Dec 1 2023,negative,worst disney animation movie ever made has no good story line the whole time im waiting for something else to happen but it doesnt doesnt keep you engaged with the wishes storyline it doesnt have that emotional connection that you get with all other disney animation movies
Dec 1 2023,negative,very disappointed  most disappointed ive been with a modern disney movie  lazy paintbynumbers story  no creativity  very meh songs  this whole thing had a phonedin vibe  but the main problem was with the script  sidenotewhat was the story with their ads saying be careful what you wish forwhy  that whole idea literally never came into play once in the whole movie
Dec 1 2023,negative,disney what is this is this your movie this movie is just boring like food fight
Dec 1 2023,positive,this film really served the old skool disney animation this is definitely going to be a classic people will remember as time goes on 
Dec 1 2023,positive,loved the lesson and loved the music good job julia micheals
Nov 30 2023,negative,typical modern disney movie that is more interested in pandering people instead of telling a great story
Nov 30 2023,positive,wish is an amazing film with an impeccable soundtrack and a great villain the story of asha and star brings back the disney magic present in the studios great classics honoring the legacy of walt disney animation 1010
Nov 30 2023,negative,another disney flop  the movie was hard to follow and just boring
Nov 30 2023,positive,wish not only excels in its storytelling and music but also in its stunning animation style the film boasts a beautiful and unique aesthetic that is both visually stunning and perfectly complements the narrative the attention to detail in every frame is truly remarkable with each character and setting being brought to life with incredible depth and nuance the animation style perfectly captures the emotions and themes of the story further immersing the audience in the films world its a true testament to the skill and creativity of the animators and artists involved in its production overall the animation style of wish is simply breathtaking and adds a whole new layer of beauty to this already exceptional film
Nov 30 2023,negative,has disney lost their touch
Nov 30 2023,negative,worst disney movie ever
Nov 30 2023,positive,wish is an overall great disney movie it delivers good animation and a great villain king macnifico really revisits the golden days of disney rest in peace walt disney
Nov 30 2023,negative,at best boring and unmemorable at worst super annoying   there were visually some extremely beautiful moments especially the king and queen and some backgrounds the music was bad humor and writing grating when it wasnt boring i love alan tudyk but i reallllly hated the goat  worst disney animation since the black cauldron
Nov 30 2023,negative,wish has a great premise but strange dialogue sloppylooking character models and a lack of any actual fleshedout characters makes the film a little painful to sit through a ridiculous amount of references also left me feeling like i had just watched a twohour long ad for disney as a company which is not at all what id like to think about when seeing a film there are much much better animated movies to watch
Nov 30 2023,negative,you know those movies that drive you to an existential crisis of why am i here i could be doing something else i could be browsing the clothes in the mall right now   see this is the problem with disney movies these days theyre not relevant or good enough theyre not even worth the cheapest ticket  i literally walked out of the theater because i was so bored i wonder if children would like it i doubt it tho     were long far from the times i watched brave 10 times in the theater because it was so good and so pretty but now they dont even allow themselves the pretty
Nov 30 2023,negative,this was very heartless and bleak very in line with all the latest releases    the characters are created very dull even when you can tell that the voice actors did their best to give em some life of course valentino is the highlight of the movie but this is just not enough     a lot of the kids in our almost empty cinema lost interest halfway through the movie and started playing  sometimes it is not clear who is the audience for this movie  there are things going on in the story that are too complicated for kids  so they lose track
Nov 30 2023,negative,honestly wish we just watched frozen or moana for the 1000th time instead of this its bland and the songs are bad my 3 and 5 year old were bored despite usually loving these kinds of films save your money
Nov 30 2023,positive,love that it had strong women characters  fun story nice songs
Nov 30 2023,negative,the plot is ok but prestaged the songs are on the level and gg average as her need to make wishes come true well such a
Nov 30 2023,negative,first of all the quality drop was seen front the beginning background looks like ai generated and characters is like simple 3d models  second of all movie seems rushed they didnt exploit background of villian and make excuse oh no he turns evil its bad to justify why he deserved what comes to him  i have a headache watching this movie c
Nov 30 2023,positive,the songs were beautiful ones i would listen to on the daily and on repeat the characters were strong and it was so similar in many ways of what our country canada is going through
Nov 30 2023,negative,disney has lost its magic i truly wanted to like this movie i did and it wasnt super woke so its not that at all i could care less the songs were forgettable the characters were unlikable and the comedy was weak andor forced i liked the animation style some bits looked a little weird but that wasnt an issue for me at all the plot didnt seem cohesive or original everything was rushed and didnt really seem like there was time to connect with any of the characters soooooooo yeah fail in my opinion
Nov 30 2023,positive,thought it was really good movie  lots of little hidden disney references that were fun to see  great positive story line
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie is great and the animation is like the movies the bad guys and the mitchelles vs the machines
Nov 30 2023,negative,one of the worst disney movies music was bad and story was boring  i liked the voice actors though
Nov 30 2023,positive,the music was great including the villian song lol the story was great i got goosebumps in the final act and it felt hopeful i didnt expect much going in but it surprised me
Nov 30 2023,positive,our wish fulfilled  great movie great soundtrack and great characters  asha is a star 
Nov 30 2023,positive,enjoyed the family atmosphere of the movieengaging
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was a super super super super super super great movie ill give it two thumbs up i recommended
Nov 30 2023,positive,was very very very surprised by this movie i went in expecting one of the worst things disney has ever made but surprisingly even after all those trailers all those clips and those songs it was still somehow not bad course it wasnt all that amazing or anything but it was a pretty enjoyable couple hours the first great disney villain in a while who wasnt a twist villain or a redeemed villain just a straight up villain for once not to say there was stuff i didnt like the goat was very very annoying and the humor they attempted with him kinda fell flat i also didnt really care too much about ashas friends but they were enjoyable enough the songs were pretty ok there were a couple pretty bad onesmost notably the im a star song but overall they were pretty solid asha was pretty likable protagonist the story felt pretty good and resolved by the end the pacing was pretty good overall it was a flawed but pretty good celebration of 100 years of disney the animation was absolutely fantastic it really felt like they were going back to their roots with it even if it would be better if it was fully 2d still the animation was still incredible overall i enjoyed it a lot more than the people online did pretty average movie 5810
Nov 30 2023,positive,overall a solid fun movie there were some areas that could have been tweaked a few more times in the writing room but it was still enjoyable a lot of fun new songs to go with it too
Nov 29 2023,negative,the king was to intense with  the music and  dark magic  my 7 year old granddaughter did not like that part
Nov 29 2023,negative,another cookie cutter meh movie from new age disney the only chance this movie took was the animation style and it didnt work songs were all forgettable as well no magic here
Nov 29 2023,positive,basic story nothing special
Nov 29 2023,negative,i am currently watching this in the theatre and im so bored i decided to write this review     the music is the worst ive ever heard in a disney movie the story is  basic and predictable and the characters dont inspire love or hate the shinning star of the whole movie is the star itself but only because its cute there was one oneliner that made me chuckle but im 80 min into the 90 min movie and those few words were  the only bright spot in the whole movie disney is officially over and it makes me sad
Nov 29 2023,positive,asha so pretty cute and beautiful 
Nov 29 2023,positive,classic disney movie it brings the child in me
Nov 29 2023,positive,the music was awesome and the storyline was empowering dont give up on your dreams or wishes there were so many easter eggs and references that it felt like a culmination of disney films the essence and spirit of disney are riddled throughout the movie the underlying messages and lessons that can be taken out of it are numerous and powerful wishes are what make people unique and you are the master of them i cant say enough good about this movie
Nov 29 2023,negative,very mid i was expecting much higher quality with disney the songs are awful the story is bland the visuals are ok and pretty sometimes
Nov 29 2023,positive,cute characters new villain
Nov 29 2023,negative,the chicken scene where the chickens were dancing and firing eggs out of their butt was totally inappropriate content and disrespectful to chickens who suffer for the millions of people who pay for chickens to suffer in battery cages and in hen barns
Nov 29 2023,positive,its a fun movie a lot of people are mixed on it right now but if nothing else its enjoyable i saw it with my sister in theatre and many of the parts including my favorite song at all costs made me tear up im impressed with the scene layouts as well the way all the wishes look like glowing orbs is beautiful
Nov 29 2023,negative,completely forgetable  the movie has a message that is kinda dangerous when you start thinking about it   the vilain is just a good guy he didnt really dis anything wrong  the hero on the other side just has personal beef against him  appart from that  animation is okay  music is okay  whole movie is just okay
Nov 29 2023,positive,disneys wish 2023 directed by chris buck is a captivating and enchanting journey that merges imagination with cosmic mysteries the film centers around asha ariana debose an intelligent idealist and her magical connection with the cosmic force star together they face the formidable king magnifico chris pine in an exhilarating battle that tests their courage and the limitless power of cosmic magic    the plot of wish 2023 seamlessly blends fantasy heartfelt emotions and thrilling action conveying the triumph of the human spirit against all odds the film serves as a reminder that when we wholeheartedly believe in our dreams and unite our willpower miracles can unfold    the exceptional performances and memorable characters elevate the film to new heights ariana debose portraying asha skillfully portrays her tenacity and vulnerability while the endearing chemistry between asha and star evokes a sense of wonder and genuine connection    chris bucks direction intertwines visually stunning scenes with compelling storytelling the outstanding visual effects transport viewers into a world where magical energies shimmer with enchantment the cinematography beautifully captures the grandeur of the cosmic landscapes immersing the audience in a breathtaking tapestry of colors and shapes    the score complements each emotion and intensifies every moment creating a magical harmony that seamlessly melds with the narrative these new disney songs have the capability of becoming the next let it go or we dont talk about bruno the films production design is marvelous with meticulously crafted sets that transport us into a realm of pure imagination the believable and visually stunning special effects further enhance the enchantment    though wish 2023 occasionally falls into predictable story beats its overarching wonder and emotional depth overshadow any shortcomings this delightful cinematic experience embarks on a captivating journey that celebrates the power of dreams resilience of the human spirit and the enchantment of the cosmic universe with stellar performances breathtaking visuals and a heartwarming story the film seamlessly weaves adventure fantasy and emotion into an unforgettable experience be prepared to be swept away on a magical ride that rekindles your belief in the transformative power of inspiration    wish 2023 evokes a range of emotions including wonder awe hope empowerment joy and a reinvigorated belief in the magic of wishing
Nov 29 2023,negative,this was shockingly bad for a disney film especially one thats supposed to be their big 100th anniversary release the songs were awful the villains motives dont make any sense and the ending was actually horrifying but played for laughs at least when falicier was sucked into voodoo hell in princess and the frog it was treated like a frightening thing     normally i love listening to disney soundtracks but the music was terrible i hear its because they hired pop music writers instead of musical theater writers but youd think the pop music writers would know how to write a song that was at least catchy     it feels like everything in this movie is a reference to another better disney movie even the protagonists seven friends are modeled off the seven dwarves    all in all really disappointing
Nov 29 2023,positive,liked wish however was too long for my child
Nov 29 2023,positive,it was so refreshing to finally watch an original movie not a spinoff reimagining or the like the animation worked well on the big screen and the trailers dont do the movie justice i have found myself listening to the soundtrack on repeat as well i cant wait to see it again dont just listen to criticssee things for yourself and decide what you think side note i also personally dont feel it had any political agenda which was a huge relief
Nov 29 2023,neutral,it typical for disney
Nov 29 2023,positive,my daughter loved the movie it was a great example of not following the status quo even if its difficult i loved all the added disney references
Nov 29 2023,negative,text book stereotypes with an unconsistant art style
Nov 29 2023,positive,great disney movie for kids music is very good nice message being sent
Nov 29 2023,positive,love the songs  its different from the regular disney  the villain is a man
Nov 29 2023,negative,not enough back story or character development seemed extremely rushed and uninspired first disney movie ive seen that truly felt that it wasnt made by disney at all
Nov 29 2023,negative,it was kinda boring the songs were okay but some of the lyrics were weird they fumbled the kings motivation i dont even think there was any also how does singing defeat the king makes no sense there really wasnt any character development no attachment the animation was wonky at times as well what is disney doing 200m for this movie is insanity
Nov 29 2023,negative,looks like a high quality playblast dont get me started on the writing
Nov 29 2023,positive,love the story but hate the grafics
Nov 29 2023,negative,once upon a time there was a man who saw his entire family killed to prevent this from happening again he became a great sorcerer and created a kingdom  everyone wanted to live there the only condition was to entrust him with his dream in exchange for protection and happiness with the possibility of one day seeing your dream come true for free  but one day in this kingdom where everyone sings and dances for joy in the streets without crime aisha decides that everyone is unhappy and that the king must be overthrown instead of leaving the country  faced with his actions the king goes crazy because he is afraid that what happened to him will happen again he was quickly betrayed by his wife    everyone is happy again the king is locked away and the queen reigns instead    morality level 0 silly and bogus songs bad images and drawings next to tangled and rebel the heroine is a pain in the ass who despises everything for others the secondary characters are forgettable    the worst disney ever created a disney at a discount
Nov 29 2023,positive,fun not a top 5 disney but not close to the bottom 5 either
Nov 29 2023,positive,this is such a great disney animation movie wish has great characters asha king magnifico and queen amaya are standouts the music is so amazing and catchy my favorite song was knowing what i know now it is super catchy fun and has great singing and lyrics this wish is a close second and at all costs is great as well though every song was good visually the movie looked great like a picture book when it comes to the story it was very good from beginning to end overall the movie was great and would recommend to disney fans
Nov 29 2023,negative,this movie is the definition of a nothing burger no substance painfully generic no relatability not funny etc  the argument cant be its made for kids you wont understand it when you have legendary movies from disneypixar like incredibles that is for everyone  pretty visuals dont work either anymore when you have masterpieces like spiderverse delivering an incredible story along with fantastic visuals  this is your movie to celebrate 100 years disney this
Nov 29 2023,positive,100 years of disney magic this by far the most astonishing animation ive ever seen and the animation of 2d and 3d combined havent been seen since disneys short paperman 2012
Nov 29 2023,positive,frankly i loved this and anyone who has liked dther disney animated films will too disney made no secret that this film was inspired by the entire history of their animated past and it is in many ways a love letter to it so yes there are easter eggs and some campy ones at that but its nothing disney has never done before those that say this is not fresh must have never watched any amount of their old films the formula is pretty much unchanged and if you loved it as a kid there is no reason you wont love wish
Nov 29 2023,positive,cute and uncomplicated loved the easter eggs
Nov 29 2023,negative,i can say is that it was awful     boring not great animation plot holes poor dialogue not great songs too much of the message infesting it and on and on    wait for it to appear on tv if you want to see it you havent missed anything except wasting your time
Nov 29 2023,positive,i thought it was a good movie it had some laughs some cute moments some great animation and some creative storytelling it wasnt the best story but it was new and pretty novel and the music was amazing
Nov 29 2023,positive,i love this movie the music was fantastic and loved the nods and hidden mickey nods to other beloved disney films the music was beautiful and i find myself randomly humming one of them true disney fans wont be disappointed
Nov 29 2023,positive,music was amazing and this movie was a love letter to my childhood
Nov 29 2023,positive,felt flat one dimensional not your typical disney masterpiece i think disney has lost its way
Nov 29 2023,negative,terrible boring story bad songs what happened to the classics
Nov 29 2023,negative,biggest disney bomb in quite a while the songs are horrible the story is dumb
Nov 29 2023,positive,i went with my family and we loved  we brought my nephew and he was absolutely engaged through out the whole movie its a really cute movie with great music  totally recommended 
Nov 29 2023,positive,wish manages to be an entertaining childrens movie while telling a much more profound story with deep themes and interesting concepts the music is original and fresh but still captures the magic of a classic disney musical film
Nov 29 2023,negative,what a waste of time
Nov 29 2023,negative,yet another morally problematic movie by disney not recommended for kids
Nov 29 2023,negative,it took every ounce of my self control not to walk out of this movie i paid money for this was worth exactly 5
Nov 29 2023,neutral,i just seen the movie today i tried to watch it but i couldnt finish the movie its just so bad and im a huge fan of disney animation ive grown up on it but this one didnt do it for me and its a shame because i was hoping it was better than some of the reviews ive seen of it the saving grace is some of the songs that was in it other than that it just felt rushed 
Nov 29 2023,negative,music sucks more of a kids movie than a family movie
Nov 29 2023,positive,i found this movie very fun its simple but sweet is it disneys magnum opus no of course not did it take me back to when i was a little kid watching disney movies yes yes it did please see it yourself with the idea in mind thats its not trying to be the next frozen and form your own opinions
Nov 29 2023,negative,how does this have a 81 audience score how many people are disney paying to type these reviews
Nov 28 2023,neutral,a film of magic that fails too pull off its signature trick    wish attempts to combine disneys history into a slick movie experience with cell shaded visuals that are pleasing and easy on the eye for a majority these add a uniqueness to the colour pallet that can burst with detail yet on wider shots can look too simple lacking definition its not the animators fault just an affect of using something cleaner in style    the protagonist of this peice shines as a curious and enjoyable character with pipes to boot she pursues her wish to free her city from the unknown tyranny of the king and gracess our ears with some catchy tunes along the way amongst this is a mixture of easter eggs that drag and drop from disneys legacy catalogue sometimes on the nose sometimes subtly clever nevertheless welcomed     however the world of wish is poorly constructed feeling as if some of its back story was left on the cutting room floor the king who plays the beloved ruler turned to evil dictator has no back story to support his characters development devoted subjects worship him with no tangible reason except his powers a plot point that services the story but not its relatability none more evident than in his love with the queen that shuns reality lacking any believability in their interactions chris pine does his best with the page yet does not have the vocal range to instill any fear in me also his physical desgin feels somewhat ai born sadly he will fade into obscurity unlikely to be portrayed at a disney theme park    too many characters surround the protagonist and diminish their personalities through predictable dialogue  the comic relief of the goat feels crammed in and void of any chemistry with his counterpart  it all feels very generic  just a reminder of how better duos of yesteryear made us laugh and cry    the script is undercooked and rushed to meet its deadline  the elements of each characters personality are not sculpted rather pre made making everything feel inorganic to the tale fleshing out the backstory of the king and building on characters links to each other would of made this film semi memorable instead disneys 100 year finale fits the typical quota but iconic it certainly isnt     note my wife loved this film my opinions irrelevant
Nov 28 2023,neutral,a boring movie with sophomoric storytelling and a muddled message aside from being an uninspiring bland and boring movie bad word of mouth among parents is what also likely killed this movie at the box office while the overt real life politics allegories would go unnoticed to children they stick up like a sorethumb to parents   in a way it was engaging and illustrative in how writers can lose perspective in trying to shoehorn their ideologies into a childrens tale you cant preach to an audience that you cant entertain to begin with you cant sacrifice entertainment at the expense of messaging specially when writing childrens tales secondly your morality tales shouldnt be muddled either the idea that everyone should get their wishes enables a sense of entitlement thats detrimental in a childs early psychological developmental stage and a proverbial financial nightmare to less affluent parents  luckily this movie was so boring that most kids will likely check out half way into it   oh yes i forgot they threw in a bunch of disney easter eggs here and there that only a few legacy disney fans would notice   in short this was made supposedly to celebrate disneys 100th year as a company but it instead felt like it was made by a bunch of newbs who didnt understand how to disney and only saw the last crop of disney films made in the last half decade  wouldnt it been a more proper 100th year celebration had they made instead a 2d handdrawn classic animation movie with a well thought out story and with a good soundtrack btw the songs in this movie are atrocious
Nov 28 2023,negative,its like the live action lion king    they just went on chatgpt and asked it to write a script    that is the story of the movie  amimation is good but the story    its just 
Nov 28 2023,positive,very well paces in acts 1 and 2 thought the mystery of what happened before gets abandoned out of the blue act three is a little faster than youd like it be but overall a very fun watch music is great and the animation is clearly tasteful
Nov 28 2023,positive,we love the songs and the simple story line good job disney
Nov 28 2023,positive,from my perspective i thought the songs were good this wish and knowing what i know now were great i didnt enjoy the villain song though while catchy it wasnt sinister enough to consider it a disney villain song  ariana debose and chris pines performances were the saving graces for the film though  they focused more on the nostalgia more than the story i thought it was nice but it did affect the story a lot the nostalgia isnt the key to make a disney hit though its the story that matters if they focused more on the story than the nostalgia this movie could have been improved a lot  plus the storybooklook for the animation was a good try but needed some work its animation wasnt bad but not as good as the spiderverse films  overall this movie is nowhere near chicken little or home on the range territory but it was not as good as the other modern animated disney films since tangled was released    my score is 7510
Nov 28 2023,positive,it was an adorable movie and a really cool one too watch in 3d
Nov 28 2023,negative,wish this didnt exist
Nov 28 2023,positive,wish is beautiful to behold and the soundtrack is very catchy this instant classic from disney has a wonderful villain and one of the cutest characters ever created wish deserves to be seen at least once for all the fun easter eggs celebrating 100 years of disney animated movies and many more times for having all the elements that have made the mouse houses films magical
Nov 28 2023,positive,its not that good id give it a 6 out 10
Nov 28 2023,neutral,visually the movie was great  it seemed a lot like the oldtime disney flare to me and i liked that  the plot was good up until the end  the ending is what did the movie in  the idea of the people defeating the powerful evil king by singing a song creating a starlight in their chest left me and my kids looking at each other thinkingwhat  it felt like the original writers got fired at the very end and disney brought in some people off the street to write the ending    overall the movie didint have the typical disney child grooming content so that was very refreshing and allowed us to actually go see a disney moviewhich we love to do  it had the typical equity diversity and inclusion garbage where the hero was a black girl and the evil king was a white guy but thats fine someone has to be the good guy and the bad guy so thats all irrevelant but its certainly in there    soif it matters to you that the movie is good before you spend 75 for tickets and popcorn id probably skip this one  however if you are just excited to be able to take your kids to a disney movie that doesnt try to expose them to lifestyle choices you disagree with then really who cares if the movie isnt very goodright  thats one fathers take      if i had it to do over again i would still take my kids because we love going to the movies together and it isnt very often disney puts out a movie i am williing to let my kids watch
Nov 28 2023,positive,it was ok in the theater and the songs are still stuck in my head days later
Nov 28 2023,negative,bad animation and bad messaging this should have been a tv movie or a direct to streaming movie
Nov 28 2023,negative,its nothing special its just meh
Nov 28 2023,negative,the backgrounds are beautifulthats all the story is boring and confusing the songs are really bad
Nov 28 2023,positive,i absolutely loved and enjoyed the movie the animation is amazing the songs and music are spectacular the characters are enjoyable and with various easter eggs homages and references of past films disney made over the last 100 years
Nov 28 2023,negative,dreadful my kids wanted to leave they were bored 
Nov 28 2023,positive,just loved the entire movie took my grandkids and they loved it also
Nov 28 2023,negative,i wasted 30 and 90 minutes watching this movie kids will have a negative impact watching this because the whole story is ridiculous if everyone got their own wish the world would be a disaster especially if it came to a stupid kid
Nov 28 2023,negative,i  wish i could get my money back 
Nov 28 2023,positive,the music and deeper messages make this movie one of the most impactful in disneys 100 years of history star dust covered wisdom and iconic characters have kept my whole family completely engaged
Nov 28 2023,positive,the music is fantastic we havent stopped listening to the soundtrack after watching the movie this movie was very fun and my 5 year old absolutely loved it so much that we have seen it twice and are going again for a 3rd time
Nov 28 2023,positive,delightful disney princess tale
Nov 28 2023,negative,super shocked it has an 80 consumer score people must be desperate to wish for a good movie from disney these days it isnt here extremely shallow plot and story and truly cringe songwriting the writers couldnt even bother to make anything rhyme when shoehorning in their messaging nothing to do with the characters color and what not dont even start and all to do with poor writing its like disney put a gun to someones head and demanded a movie be created based on the when you wish upon a star disney theme if we find out in the news later that that someone likely will be found dead on the floor and that the script was actually aigenerated i wouldnt be surprised at all disney is reaching new lows truly
Nov 28 2023,positive,my 6 year old daughter and 8 year old son liked it but not my 10 year old son i thought the characters were just ok there werent any amazing songs and it was slow at times it didnt seem like a typical amazing disney movie with catchy songs and lovable characters as i watched it seemed like a b movie nothing like moana frozen or encanto disney lost the magic on this one
Nov 28 2023,positive,this movie evoked a lot of emotion and i loved it  it rips through its clunky premise so fast at the beginning both in narration and in song this is probably a choice made in hopes that you wont easily poke holes in it but it also doesnt let you pick up any of the parts that actually make some sense its not deep so besides the mild confusion at first its very easy to catch up     once the line is drawn groan between hero and villain the movie is very enjoyable a few of the songs are the best ive heard in a disney movie in some time personally didnt care for encanto and moana seemed to mostly have concepts of songs that werent finished    i really enjoyed the nods to animation itselfthe flipbook animation that asha draws in her journal the pixie dust and how it takes different forms at one point having some gravity which it has from movie to movie    the references to previous titles are usually too obvious kind of how disney treats star wars and indiana jones now thanks marvel but some are fun chris pine nails pat carrolls performance of a few ursula lines    its gorgeous on the big screen especially the look at first feels as though the color model is cmyk ie all pigment and then once asha makes her wish this water color model has a lot of emissive rgb light working on the geometry as well as the simulated surface of the paper that its all meant to look painted onto for a movie that looks so 2d it seems that technically they have added some dimensions the scale of the paper media vs the scale of the geometry how paint interacts with other paint and the paper and how all of that reacts to light radiosity     for the most of the runtime of this movie it is captivating and gives you characters to cheer and a fun instavillain but that terrible setup seems like congress was invited in to put together the story like they were writing a healthcare bill it also seems like female protagonists in recent disney movies are all written with the same voice and mannerisms and for a movie that draws on heritage it would have been a great time to lean on the more interesting character development and dialogue variety that the films of the past had been much more adept at
Nov 28 2023,negative,the plot was boring and the songs were disjointednot catchy  nothing like the old disney movies that we watched in theater and then went on to buy for our collection
Nov 28 2023,positive,i loved the movie very different than your typical disney movies there was no prince which was very different the movie was wholesome
Nov 28 2023,negative,i enjoyed the movie for all of the five minutes of disney past movie intro at the moment the movie started it was unbearable to watch i knew literally everything thats gonna happen  and the plot was written rottenly jennifer lee are you a five year old on vacation with nothing to do but write such a boring movie that i wanted to sleep this movie can be described in one word cringe
Nov 28 2023,positive,once again we see a huge disconnect between the critics who seem to have it in for disney and the audience who genuinely love this movie yes its a story designed around the centenary of disney so there is a nostalgia trip wrapped around the very disney theme of when you wish upon a star those of us who are fans of disney love that we love looking out for the easter eggs but we also loved the story about why dreams and wishes are so important and should never be given away and we loved the songs personally i was welling up over some of the songs and we loved the humour which was silly but seemed to have children and adults laughing throughout honestly ignore the sad cynical critics and go and enjoy a fitting tribute to 100 years of disney magic
Nov 28 2023,negative,no creativity on display here just another soulless stinker from disney
Nov 28 2023,negative,cynical uninspired bereft of imagination
Nov 28 2023,positive,beautiful movie very entertaining touching movie love it 
Nov 28 2023,negative,wish i hadnt watched that
Nov 28 2023,negative,quite a bit on the dark side and it did not hold our 3 and 6 year olds attention like encanto coco and frozen  just expected more from disney but visuals were good
Nov 28 2023,negative,this is what i would imagine an ai script would play out like this movie was all over the place did not make sense but my daughter liked it so i guess thats all that matters two stars
Nov 28 2023,negative,sadly the magic of disney to celebrate its 100 years was nothing more than a lie and disappointment a shame
Nov 28 2023,positive,while not among disneys alltime greats wish still has a lot of heart character and great songs to share the nods for their 100th anniversary i personally felt almost never crossed into blatant fanservice while the side characters are mostly forgettable the main heroine and the villain carry the movie the way they should and i found both enjoyable and interesting characters i thought the movie was very visually pleasing to watch with some moments that were absolutely stunning i thought wish was a very good enjoyable movie that is not deserving of all the hate it is getting from critics
Nov 28 2023,positive,my favorite movie it was so so good feels so classic and i love asha 
Nov 28 2023,positive,loved the nod it gave to snowhite and the seven dwarfs  disney doesnt disappoint loved it
Nov 28 2023,positive,excellent movie  the rare animated feature that is fun for both kids and adults  thought all the players did a great job but was particularly taken with chris pine playing against type as the vindictive sorcerer king  he was a hoot  d however the real star of the show waswell the literal star who comes to the aid of the heroine asha and her pals  adorable   how good was this film  hope disney will plan for a sequel  
Nov 28 2023,positive,this is a perfectly fine disney movie its not their greatest effort but my young daughters and i enjoyed it there are a couple of really catchy songs and the story is sort of standard disney fare but we had a good time nonetheless i mean these are kids movies i think people are overthinking it
Nov 28 2023,negative,minimal world building musical numbers were lackluster plot is expectable and characters are unoriginal and lack depth
Nov 28 2023,positive,the music was beautiful the story was heart felt and star was the sweetest
Nov 28 2023,positive,this movie provides a wellmissed dosage of old disney charm even if it isnt backed with good enough storytelling to add it to the classics
Nov 28 2023,positive,i do not understand why everyone giving this movie a hard time its cute with a great message  we all need a star to wish on and  become a dreamers  i love the seven dwarfs hidden reference
Nov 28 2023,positive,i dont know what the critics watched its a must see for the music secrets and magic that come during the journey
Nov 28 2023,positive,the storyline is cute and i loved the small disney easter eggs but the songs felt more like they were talking more then singing
Nov 28 2023,positive,we all need hope  and dreams  and the freedom to be who we are
Nov 28 2023,negative,they really have lost all their magic sad disney sad
Nov 28 2023,positive,did it capture the disney magic yes beautiful film with endearing characters
Nov 28 2023,positive,my 5 year old daughter myself and my 66 year old mother loved this movie its a nice story for the kids and the easter eggs throughout the movie made it so much fun for myself  my mom there were a lot of funny moments that we all enjoyed not sure why critics are panning it
Nov 28 2023,positive,actual 35 good story ckd all the right boxes disneywise another girl power tale  bad guy was just selfish andbad more backstory on him might have helped big fail on comic relief req for disney hagoata mah boring
Nov 28 2023,positive,my 5 year old loved this movie age appropriate cute message if a bit lacking at times worth watching with the kids
Nov 27 2023,negative,not a great movie boring
Nov 27 2023,positive,family loved it great call backs to all of the disney classics great soundtrack
Nov 27 2023,positive,fantastic songs wonderful visuals great characters villain and heroine and an original story  this makes an awesome disney movie
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie is so nothing
Nov 27 2023,negative,this is a sad excuse for a disney movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,the villain was a bit of a let down her personality could have been fleshed out great soundtrack
Nov 27 2023,positive,the movie is perfect disney the star and valentino are absolutely adorable i loved it in 3d
Nov 27 2023,positive,i dont know what critics are talking about fairly decent story some actual character development  albeit not as much as they should have but its there not saying much but easily one of the better movies this year
Nov 27 2023,negative,disney lost his magic 
Nov 27 2023,positive,better than expected girls 3 and 5 eyes were glued to the screen and they say its their favorite movie now
Nov 27 2023,negative,another sad disney offering  wonder what they will try to ruin next
Nov 27 2023,positive,i was just expecting a better movie and i was not a fan of the art style
Nov 27 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it wish the characters were a little more developed
Nov 27 2023,positive,i loved the movie wish its one of the best disney movies ever the characters are fun and the music is amazing it was like watching a broadway musical  i cant wait to get the sound track loved it
Nov 27 2023,negative,i really wanted this movie to be great unfortunately the way it was made just fell flat the connections to previous films really took me out of the story they didnt add to this world but just made me think of better disney movies i think all of disney deserved a better movie for the 100th anniversary the only thing that was memorable was the line my butt found it i feel like it is a problem if that is the only writing i can remember this ended up being a lot of fluff and very little story telling and substance
Nov 27 2023,negative,the thought behind making a film to honor and remember the incredible disney legacy is legitimate if only they tried to make it good the plot isnt awful but it is incredibly manufactured and uninspired the animation is newish and interesting but it didnt remind me of disney they were trying to go for the paintedcg of spiderverse or puss in boots it looked much less concise than both the music is the biggest offender i dont understand why a movie meant to remind the audience of why they love disney uses pop writers to write their big numbers disney is known for their broadway style scores and songs and these are pop songs sure theyre a bit catchy but it lacks variety and feels even more lifeless than the characters and boring plot this film is lifeless
Nov 27 2023,positive,beautiful visuals moving story and feels very disney fantastic film to celebrate the 100th of the company on
Nov 27 2023,negative,terrible story terrible message for kids and as generic and cliche of a disney movie as ive ever seen watching this movie felt like one writer wanted to tell the story of the garden of eden while another wanted to tell the story of castros rise to power in cuba then a third added a bunch of random bland songs in order to attempt to draw it all together the climax of the movie is utter nonsense that only a 4yearold would find satisfying as an ending
Nov 27 2023,positive,all the disney magic that ive loved my whole life with wonderful music and a message added in a charming way
Nov 27 2023,positive,i thought this movie was very touching showed a brand new industry animation style and was very pretty with original music  each song worked with the scenes to make this seem like a real princess movie while also keeping its traditions as other recent princess movies have broken this movie is wonderful and should be watched as this movie has brung me faith and confidence to the movie and characters must see
Nov 27 2023,positive,stop listening to what everyone else says and just watch the movie for yourself its actually a good movie not a masterpiece but theres great songs and homages to previous works its worth the watch and i love many of the characters
Nov 27 2023,negative,boring premise of story felt contrived and stupid plot was ridiculous and disjointed character arc of the villain was not well developed 12 year old daughter and i both wished we hadnt seen it
Nov 27 2023,positive,its a gorgeous film best if you can see it in 3d lots of references for longtime disney animation fans which is most of us
Nov 27 2023,positive,its a good movie for kids  great animation and nice songs  a good family movie
Nov 27 2023,negative,it was a poor plot the singing was lame and the imagery was so not of the disney standard too bad
Nov 27 2023,positive,it is hard to understand the excessively negative reviews for this film it is an uplifting feelgood film with gorgeous animation several catchy songs and an amazing heroine  while the messaging is intentional and at times too much the pace moves and keeps your interest until the triumphant ending  a good family film for the holidays
Nov 27 2023,positive,emotional exiting great colors great sounds
Nov 27 2023,neutral,disney wish a disappointed mess  
Nov 27 2023,positive,this definately wasnt one of disneys best but it wasnt the worst either  beautifully animated but the story line was not very strong  the music was rather bleh with no catchy or memorable tunes  in fact during the songs i found myself looking for easter eggs instead of listening to musiclyrics
Nov 27 2023,negative,a pure mockery of disney animation this is coming from someone who was counting down the days to opening night
Nov 27 2023,positive,i thought this movie was wonderful it was seriously the perfect movie for the 100th anniversary
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie is bonkers lol chewing up the scenery villain and squirrels that sing lol whoever wrote this script needs to learn how to write its as if disnet threw up on the screen absolutely no story just plot disneys movies have lately been in a toilet
Nov 27 2023,negative,there are tons of plot holes the dialogue is terrible there is no reason to care about any of the characters the villain is just a different version of jafar the songs are awful the feeble attempts to reference other disney characters to bring some kind of legitimacy to the movie were embarrassing i have nothing positive to say
Nov 27 2023,positive,my review wouldve been 4 stars but i saw it on 4dx which is amazing it is definitely for kids as i am 10
Nov 27 2023,positive,disney made a bit of a mistake advertising wish as a big 100year celebration for the studio i do think this movie is one of the weaker animated entries but i still think it is a good movie for anyone who likes the formula the story and characters just feel really underdeveloped and it makes the movie feel more generic and by the numbers i still think this movie has good animation and actually a really great soundtrack the movie has moments that tug at the heartstrings but it definitely could have packed a bigger emotional punch had it allowed us to truly dive into the world overall it is a sweet movie that as a fan of the disney musical formula i did enjoy for the most part
Nov 27 2023,positive,the animation in this movie was beautiful but the story was lacking i felt like the characters werent developed enough so i wasnt invested my husband put it like this it feels like a kids movie instead of a family movie very predictable
Nov 27 2023,positive,i think that this movie was very cute and magical i liked that disney added an actual villain to the story unlike some of the recent movies the animation was great and the voice acting was great the soundtrack lacked a little with this is the thanks i get but other than that was great it was a very nice storyline and the characters were fitting the nods to past disney films was fun to see like peter pan and wendy or the reference to mary poppins and cinderellas dress and carriage overall i liked the movie it was not disneys best film but it certainly was a good movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,fantastic animation and music we loved trying to spot all the easter eggs  the main moralconflict of the story was also unique even though the format generally stayed true to what works for kids movies      i was skeptical given the negative critical reviews most of the criticism is pointless because these critics ignore that this is a kids movie meant for fun  yes wish follows a general formula yes wish is loaded with references to disneys past yes the magic system isnt deeply explained  but  this is a movie geared to kids and disney fans  my kids had a blast spotting hidden mickey mouse symbols spotting peter pan etc  they listen to the sound track on repeat and im sure that they will be watching this over and over to see if they can spot more disney references
Nov 27 2023,negative,waiting for the climaxstill waiting
Nov 27 2023,positive,my family really enjoyed the movie and the music enjoyed having an actual villain love all the references to other disney animated movies
Nov 27 2023,negative,not sure if this was supposed to be for 6 year olds or the family i found it boring with bad writing
Nov 27 2023,positive,i liked that it was only 1 hr 35 mins and very few previews my 7yr old granddaughter was able to stay focused on the movie and was not bored
Nov 27 2023,positive,i saw this movie with three little girls who squealed giggled danced and sang the whole movie i think that means it was a win
Nov 27 2023,negative,boring it was a movie to show off how many references they can jam into a movie and to be honest i wish i hadnt gone to see it bland story even worse music and the villain who had so much promise just was so lack luster i hate the switch villain but i would prefer it over the villain we were given design and style was fine and i loved asha as a promising character but left so much to be desired
Nov 27 2023,negative,i wish i wish i never saw this movie       we brought 3 girls including our daughter to see this  they loved the goat and that was all  didnt talk about it after 10 mins  spent the rest of the drive home playing would you rather   would you rather watch wish 4 times in a row or do homework for 2 hours     the world seems pretty happy no worries all needs covered even her family is happy the opening scene is her giving a tour of the delightful city with all the happy dancing people of the kingdom  each person at age 18 gives a wish to the king  he then decides in secret if their wish is safe to grant  most are not because he believes they are too vague and could potentially lead to something bad    she finds out his secret and wants to give everyone their one wish back thats when the trouble starts    they even have one character question the wish theory what if our wish changes  exactly  and most people have more than one wish for themselves in their lifetime so this movie fails to share a message for children about their dreams  that if one of their wishes doesnt come true they will be unhappy forever
Nov 27 2023,positive,this film conveys a powerful message about wishing upon a star while reflecting nostalgic classic tales great for adults and best for children
Nov 27 2023,positive,great original story music and hero my whole family loved it
Nov 27 2023,negative,movie is confusing in all aspects  songs were not very catching plot was uninspired and animation style was confusing overall not a great movie and very little rewatchability
Nov 27 2023,negative,summary  i was forced to watch disneys wish on thanksgiving w my family at my local amc movie theater seeing it once was enough i definitely wouldnt have seen it on my own honestly its just a nothing movie its not good but its not bad either its overly simplistic hollow  above all safe theres no real character growth nothing really gets doneaccomplished  there isnt a good message or key takeaway its just a forgettable movie that feels like it was made specifically to occupy toddlerschildren  not a movie for families of all ages      positives  1 new ip  a new original ip w a sort of newish story disney has been creatively bankrupt  stuck simply doing liveaction remakes so its a good thing to see them branching out  trying something new   2 2d artanimation  im happy that they attempted to recreate that magical 2d art  animation style of disneys renaissance era      negatives  1 lack of care  quality  it permeates every single stage  aspect of this movie you can clearly tell that disney cut corners cut costs  didnt care about producing  delivering a highquality product that they are proud of they could have attempted to push the bar  try to deliver something bigger  better but they didnt  2 missing opening short  given that this movie was meant to be the thing celebrating 100 years of animation it would have been smart to take a page out of pixar  include an animated short at the beginning of the movie ohi dont knowlike their 100 years of magic celebration short  3 art  animation style  wish comes across like the studio couldnt decide on the style they actually wanted to go w so they went w a hybrid 2d3d style that just looks off the watercolor backgrounds make the end product look like it was made to be on a disney junior tv show catering to 15yearolds the locals backgrounds colors lighting imagery etc just seem a bit dull  washed out when compared to disneys other recent animated ip like encanto  moana or even older ip like treasure planet or the lion king  4 music  songs  credit where due the vocalists are good however wish is trying less to emulate masterful orchestral scores  awardwinning musical theater numbers of old  more top pop 100 additionally the movies song lyrics were clearly created by ai  the attempt at rhyming is terrible   5 the princess asha  unfortunately ashas a bland boring  forgettable cookiecutter princess she follows the same adorkable  quirky archetype as rapunzel anna moana  mirabelle although they had reasons for being that way her dresscostume is unsellable  6 whos actually the herovillian  the villain king magnifico comes across not only as pragmatic but the films actual lead this only further hits home when you consider his charismatic personality his early rationale actions  goals despite being portrayed as evil while on the other hand the hero asha actually comes across as the villain of the story based on her ignorance  endgoal furthermore it seems two different teams worked on king magnifico  7 animal supporting characters  valentino that he even talked at all  it was a va casting mismatch he was far too much in a bad way from his dialogue lines his comedy  his baby costume star was just a discount lumos from the mario nintendo franchise  8 sidebackground characters  unremarkable  forgettable especially ashas seven friends  9 the magic system  magic needs a story for how  why it exists in any given franchise or universe along w a set of rules governing how  why that magic is used wishs magic is far too open vague  nondescript  10 comedy  it was boring childish  fell flat  11 easter eggs  i dont think the team working on this movie understands the term easter egg its meant to be a subtle nod to past works through hidden details  meanings that an audience probably wont see or get the first time they watch the movie but in wish these easter eggs are flatout thrown in the audiences faces or blatantly pointed out  told to the audience  12 bad ending  the ending wasnot good the villain was literally defeated by singing the queen who supposedly loves her husband just throws him away in jail without a care or second thought it was like the team working on this movie was also just done with everything  no longer cared  13 badmissing message  first wish has already been done before  done better with pinocchio  aladdin second it teaches the wrong things the truth is that not all wishes deserve to be heard  granted some people wish for benevolent unselfishpositivehelpful things  others wish for malevolent selfishnegativehurtful things furthermore some wishes are meant to be selfobtained through hard work  dedication as when we finally obtain them they mean that much more to us
Nov 27 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it i loved the story the characters the music the music was absolutely phenomenal     my only complaint was i felt the easter eggs took from the movie but it was tolerable
Nov 27 2023,positive,absolutely loved it the songs are incredible and the story is lovely  so nice disney is keeping up with the non romantic storyline definitely recommend
Nov 27 2023,negative,awful bland instantly forgettable disney panderverse tripe 100 year celebration walt will be thawing in his freezer right now at this
Nov 27 2023,negative,the music was awful especially the main villain song it sounds so generic and soulless also the villain doesnt act like the villain in the slightest there was so many overused tropes it made my brain rot the omggg haha quirky and silly  girl and the cute animal with a deep voice was so bland and hard to watch everything felt so unoriginal the movie tried to be a mix of 2d and 3d but it just ended up looking awful and unfinished please do me a favor and dont watch this god awful movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,really lovely film highlighting the nostalgia of old disney films whilst creating its own strong story and characters music was beautiful with the exception of the villains song which could have been more powerful but overall a great movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,the biggest sin is that the villain is overly generic and seemed more self absorbed than evil make bold choices disney stop pandering to everyone  also yes music is a big part of every disney movie but why force all the musical segments and make them feel so unnatural felt like they were trying to make a musical but didnt really commit to that choice consistently either leaving a very uneven result
Nov 27 2023,positive,i love wish so much i just love how the movie basically takes cues from enchanted by being a love letter to disney it reminds us all why we fell in love with disneys movies in the first place ignore the critics and haters if you love disney you will love this too im definitely seeing it again
Nov 27 2023,positive,absolutely loved this the musicsongs are absolutely incredible  on par with frozen and moana the story is also really great and the star is super cute a must watch
Nov 27 2023,positive,beautiful animation with a classic throwback to old disney feel a lot of references to past disney classics throughout my two daughters loved it and asked me to download the soundtrack after theyve been singing it ever since not sure if it will show me as verified or not i bought the tickets through my cinemark app not fandango
Nov 27 2023,negative,typical disney flick
Nov 27 2023,negative,sorry but this is garbage even my kids 6 and 5 years old confirmed that they dont want to see any more disney garbage that should say you something
Nov 27 2023,positive,disclaimer i am still to this day a long time disney fan so i knew i was gonna love it anyways going into it but this review is gonna be as objective and fair as possible as i understand why people hate this film i just personally vastly disagree     i almost had a emotional response when watching this film a massive tribute to disneys beautiful legacy i loved spotting all the easter eggs and nods to the classics i actually really liked the watercolor style the animators went with the songs id personally argue while not better then frozen is on par with encanto and all the other disney classics the cast are all great and i personally feel like all the characters were well developed valentino was not super necessary but he never hindered the watching experience oh and stay for the end credits and youll have a blast spotting your fav characters    with once upon a studio and this film i feel like disney did a amazing job with their 100th anniversary and heres to more memories upon a star in the future
Nov 27 2023,negative,a wishcom disney movie
Nov 27 2023,negative,songs werent catchy or memorable very dark story not particularly funny what i disliked most was the lack of a redemption arc for the main protagonist he seemed to have good intentions built on past trauma then touches bad magic once then thats it forever bit lazy writing really too many extra characters made it confusing  the jokes were sloppy  unfunny not entertaining for accompanying adults  also my 5 year old found it a bit too scary it was a u give it a miss
Nov 27 2023,positive,disneys newest animated film made to commemorate the companys 100th anniversary is a charming film that reminds its audience what makes disney so special  and that wish doesnt have that magic the film is definitely enjoyable but not the landmark its trying to be it seems to exist only to remind you of better disney animated movies its whole story is based on disney easter eggs that  while fun  make the film feel hollow  and i didnt even hate the movie its not terrible by any means and is actually quite likeable  i just wish it was more i wish i could have come out saying we have a new disney classic with gorgeous animation loveable characters and memorable songs truthfully i dont think we got any of that with wish i never felt any heart as the movie was lacking the emotional resonance that disney animation is best known for it has the plot of a classic disney fairytale and none of the soul the story was predictable and the characters all seemed to be developed based on traits of other popular disney characters again its not a bad movie per se but the films arbitrary worldbuilding unappealing animation and bland protagonist make this a forgettable watch    usually i can come out of a disney movie and at least say the animation was gorgeous but here i didnt love it i thought the combination of the 3d cgi animation of recent disney movies with the more classic handdrawn watercolour style was an interesting idea that just didnt work and yes it did look like you were entering a storybook at times but at others it just lookediffy i get what they were going for with an optimistic attempt to uncover innovation with tradition and i appreciate the risk yet it yields a flickering result they should have just either continued with the 3d style which usually looks gorgeous or gone back to the old style of their classic films completely as this hybrid style felt a little cheap and gimmicky     and the songs while they arent bad this wish is quite excellent they are nowhere near the caliber of other disney musical songs why well because disney hired someone who had never written a musical before they hired a pop artist in some cases this would work but personally i think it would have turned out better if they brought in the frozen songwriters or even linmanuel miranda who killed it with moana and encanto artists who know how to structure a musical and write songs that convey so much story character and emotion in just a few lines as an example i bet we all know the songs let it go or youre welcome but i doubt anyone will be singing this wish or this is the thanks i get years down the line    still its an enjoyable charming movie i cannot understate that despite all its flaws its still infectiously likeable just not loveable it is not a terrible movie by any means just not a fantastic one ariana deboses stunning voice and chris pines wicked performance give it necessary life and its tale of societal resistance against a selfish ruler is admirable but its just not as fresh or exciting as it wishes to be those easter eggs were fun though it definitely is one of the most disney movies ever made
Nov 27 2023,positive,what a beautiful movie my daughter sang and laughed the whole movie she loved that a non princess saved the day with her friends because they were brave she also thought the goat was very silly i loved the nostalgia and the animation and music was great
Nov 27 2023,negative,the worst disney movie to date they should have not released this one
Nov 27 2023,positive,such a beautiful movie the music is beautiful the visuals are breathtaking the story is original and there are so many fun easter eggs for disney fans from lion king sleeping beauty cinderella to peter pan plus 2 hidden mickeys you must stay after the credits to see ashas grandfather fulfill his wish it made me cry this movie is an absolute gem
Nov 27 2023,positive,i personally had fun while watching this one and the combined elements of the beautifully done visuals the likeable characters and moving songs with some amazing vocals did give me some goosebumps even from time to time however i have to agree with some critiques in the regard of it not being very original and more like disney by the numbers kind of thing i would have wished for something a bit more fresh and profound but still all in all theres nothing bad about it really i will definitely watch it again and buy the 4k uhd in the future 
Nov 27 2023,negative,pretty boring not a lot of substance
Nov 27 2023,positive,the movie is full of cute references that only a true disney fan can see the art and music are amazing and i had a blast today at the movies i cant wait to see it again
Nov 27 2023,neutral,i was not impressed by this disney movie i had completely different expectations and was hoping for a happy feel good movie i felt so much more of the dark angry character and it was a bit much for me i feel this couldve been made way better id wait for it on disney  if i could have a doover
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie was bad one of problems with this was the animation was awful and tries to mimic spider verse the characters in this movie are so bland and generic have nothing fun like the sleepy one the one whos angry the quiet one the dumb one the music in this movie is so bad i cant see how disney was like yeah thats fine when feel like it shouldnt been more alive and less bland the plot of the movie was the only good part with an okay idea that was not executed correctly my biggest problem is that the villain wants to help people and when the people want help he goes insane for disneys big 100th anniversary movie this was so bland and boring like strange world and lightyear
Nov 27 2023,positive,an absolute for any disney fan out there amazing and magical all the way through out the film and features a lot of original surprises from our most beloved disney films two thumbs way up on this movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,wish is better than what critics would have you believe it has gorgeous visuals catchy songs and a good emotional core and the references to past films were far more subtle and tasteful than people have said with a few exceptions however it feels too underdeveloped and short a lot of animated movies seem to limit themselves to 90 minutes while trying to have big stories and wish definitely is one of them it just feels too fast to really get to know the characters or to have moments feel truly earned overall i enjoyed it i definitely would give it a chance but i think there is room for improvement i just hope the disney company gives its artists more room for innovation and risks like they did in the past wish celebrates so lovingly
Nov 27 2023,positive,this movie was beautifully animated  some shots were downright gorgeous  story wise the first half of the movie felt like it was doing a lot of explaining which is probably necessary for a movie with a unique and fairly ambitious concept that is also aimed at all ages  it really took off in the second half and ended extremely powerfully  disney diehards will really enjoy all the subtle nods to previous disney classics kids will enjoy the main characters our daughter immediately updated her christmas and birthday wishlist to add as much star merchandise as possible
Nov 27 2023,positive,enjoyed the oldschool looking animation the nods to other disney movies and the message heartwarming movie just wished the songs were better
Nov 27 2023,negative,the movie seemed rushed music was cringe and mid characters bland and just overall bad movie while watching the whole movie i was just cringing and confused characters were forgetful and literally blended into the background plot was pretty boring the talking animals just singing out of nowhere for what reason everything was just confusing and did nothing for the plot if there was even a proper plot to begin with it was honestly a whole lot of nothing the goat was so annoyingi wish it didnt talk only funnycute thing in the movie was the star but that was it i know its supposed to be for kids but honestly only a 5 year old would find any of this funny i dont know what demographic disney is trying to appeal to because this is trash try make something decent for a change disney
Nov 27 2023,positive,really cute fun movie i dont usually watch disney movies but my wife and her friends wanted to go im really glad we did too super cute fun catchy songs and really gets to the heart of what makes us who we are very cute really enjoyed
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie was an unimpressive addition to a recent line of bland and predictable disney films for the studios 100th anniversary film wish is as forgettable as the others the animation style which was promised to unite the former hand drawn aesthetic with the modern 3d was awful to look at it looked cheap rather than impressive disney truly should look into their writing style before damaging their legacy any further
Nov 27 2023,positive,great story and music  makes you feel good
Nov 27 2023,positive,i really liked this one good pacing no part of the movie drags also the music is well written and drives the story
Nov 27 2023,negative,garbage from king garbage of the garbage density
Nov 27 2023,positive,it is fine for really young kidsbut it just lacks everything that makes a kids movie great for the family like lion king  sorry wait for free streaming
Nov 27 2023,positive,my family really enjoyed this movie the music is phenomenal the plot was good enough to keep me entertained and my young daughter glued to the screen several new memorable characters that are great additions to the disney universe im sure once it is on streaming platforms its going to be watched several more times in my household
Nov 27 2023,neutral,it had some interesting ideas asha the star and valentino were charming with looked great in the animation style however it looked more like a disney junior show that decided to just advertise disneys history rather than creating its own unique world  there is one really good song and the voice talents do a great job sadly it will be a forgettable movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was a great movie our grandchildren loved it and we enjoyed the storyline
Nov 27 2023,positive,i watch this movie with my daughters we loved the music and really liked the message behind this movie dont give up on your wishes or dreams it was a great disney movie with a great message too
Nov 27 2023,negative,garbage is the best way to describe it
Nov 27 2023,negative,i was really hoping that this would be the movie that would break disneys misses i have been a huge disney fan for most on my life     wish falls short in all areas from having a dismal plot and honestly a completely forgettable cast of characters     one of the best ways to rate a disney movie is from the music which in wishs case is again completely forgettable we took my 6 year old for her birthday and when we got back to the car she was singing moana and frozen not wish     the comic relief from the animal cast was a sad attempt at levity in cases where is was not needed and came off as mostly pathetic     my last statement will be to any disney folks that are may read this get better writers get better stories get better lyricists fire all of the executives that are holding you back there are a bunch of writers out there find one
Nov 27 2023,positive,my 7yearold daughter loved it and as soon as it came out of the theater she wanted to see it again thats enough for me to qualify it as an excellent movie
Nov 27 2023,negative,the villian doesn have history and the references are so bad implementend
Nov 27 2023,positive,absolutely loved  it was so nice to have an oldstyle disney movie back plus i loved all of the past disney movie references  i feel as if you gotta be a fan of disney to like this movie as much as i did  im a huge disney fan
Nov 27 2023,negative,unfortunately this movie lacked creativity overall
Nov 27 2023,positive,the movie held my grandsons interest grandparents enjoyed it as well
Nov 27 2023,positive,i expected to hate this movie but i ended up enjoying it a lot there are some issues for sure and some things that were just annoying but it didnt effect the story itself it was cute and enjoyable better than moana and way better than a lot of other disney films recently at least give it a shot the kids sitting behind me in the theatre loved it
Nov 27 2023,positive,i enjoyed the story line and the music  my granddaughter loved it but hated the evil king which is expected but the movie held her attention
Nov 27 2023,positive,really good movie great animation funnny characters awsome songs this movie is great to celebrate the walt disney 100 anniversary
Nov 27 2023,positive,i watched the movie and loved the music and very distinctive animation valentino and star so cute  now i need to watch it again to see if i have captured every easter egg
Nov 27 2023,negative,an awful story filled with predictable flaws and plotholes boring and corporatesounding soundtrack awful muted and bland colour palette overused character tropes huge disappointment for a 100thanniversary film especially from disney
Nov 27 2023,positive,singing was good   dialogue was a bit boring   overall decent entertainment
Nov 27 2023,positive,i loved it a classic
Nov 27 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie the music the story everything i am sorry but i dont see the justification for the hate for it
Nov 27 2023,positive,so good the hate is so unnecessary
Nov 27 2023,positive,best way to bring the best of the 100 years of disney
Nov 27 2023,positive,i loved it cant wait to watch it again
Nov 27 2023,positive,an enjoyable movie it should be celebrated for what it is  an homage to 100 years of magic from the disney company in my opinion theres nothing wrong with that we enjoyed it and will be singing the songs for a long time to come
Nov 27 2023,positive,one of the best animated films that disney has made in its last years not only for the animation but also for the songs and the essence of returning to its classic stories without a doubt one of the best of year
Nov 27 2023,positive,great movie to watch with the kids
Nov 27 2023,positive,we enjoy the movie really good me and my daughter my friend daughter will love it  i hope they come out for the second one where is soon
Nov 27 2023,positive,whats with disney and dead parents this girl applies to job with the king 1st day giving him bs and tells him how he should be running stuff nice visuals toooooo many songs
Nov 27 2023,negative,nope this aint it banned from household
Nov 27 2023,positive,huge disney fans however my wife and i did not enjoy the film storyline was weak and the songs were lacking our kids enjoyed it though and to us thats what matters
Nov 27 2023,positive,the animation is not too bad the music is pretty good but the story was not handled in a way where it will be very impactful for a 100year celebration the story structure felt quite messy during the first half but picks itself up once the story has truly began to settle during the second half still a good movie to watch with familyfriends and fun for true disney fans to catch all the nice references
Nov 27 2023,negative,movie about a power hungry man who makes unfulfilled promises to people and betrays his wife  animated life of trump
Nov 27 2023,positive,very good family movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,it felt rushed the music also felt outdated and out of place from the actual film do better disney
Nov 26 2023,positive,i loved every minute of this movie not only for the easter eggs but also for the underlying message the story tells not many will get it but iykyk and you will appreciate it for more than just being a cute movie this movie shows what the world is lacking and how to make it better see the bigger picture in this picture its beautiful and brilliantly done bravo disney no sequel needed unless there is more to learn
Nov 26 2023,positive,i loved this movie the message the soundtrack the easter eggs hidden in the movie from disney etc my family and i really enjoyed the movie and would see it again
Nov 26 2023,positive,i actually liked it a lot definitely not very special and not much happens but its cute and liked the ending
Nov 26 2023,positive,everything this is exactly what disney stands for quality family entertainment with great songs wonderful characters the story had a lot of disney hidden easter eggs see if you can find them 
Nov 26 2023,positive,a straight forward enjoyable movie that my 9 year old daughter and her friend my 5 year old daughter and i all loved this wish has been stuck in my head ever since and is a power ballad on par with any disney classic ill enjoy having this soundtrack on repeat for awhile
Nov 26 2023,positive,on the whole i was pleasantly entertained and both my kids liked it the bar has honestly gotten so low for disney movies lately  that anything even remotely okay seems like an improvement over the covidera crud that the studio has been trotting out the plot was interesting and also a bit headscratching the music was largely forgettable  certainly no let it go level show stoppers the villain was sort of a strangely flawed beautiful man  not really scary or all that interesting where is a good maleficent or ursula when you need one it was not a perfect movie but it did show some of the disneylevel love and quality that true fans wish for
Nov 26 2023,positive,wish brought tears to my entire familys eyes a true must see this holiday season
Nov 26 2023,negative,disney breaking into pieces
Nov 26 2023,positive,absolutely loved this moviethe animation style is unique storytelling songs and easter eggs love love love  folks go see it and make up your own mind
Nov 26 2023,negative,the animation was weird like a combo of pixar and old school disney the story was lacking and the music was not catchy i dont know it just wasnt as good as recent disney and pixar movies this one felt rushed
Nov 26 2023,negative,nothing made sense the didnt build on it at all i couldnt even tell how the fuck the magic worked its like they only paid attention to the easter eggs and not the story
Nov 26 2023,positive,a fun heartwarming film 
Nov 26 2023,positive,gorgeously animated sweet and nostalgic and fresh all at once
Nov 26 2023,positive,this was a classic disney movie totally owning everything that that means turning it up to 11 and delivering it with hard hitting emotion my wife and i were both in tears some parts effected her more and others had me shaking truly a great movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie has all the magic a disney movie should have and left me mistyeyed it reminds the cynical not to lose their inner magic it reminds us that there is light even when we cant find it and encourages us to pursue our passions even in the face of impossible odds this movie is the best thing disney has put out in a long time and it encouraged me to pursue dreams i thought were long gone and out of reach its a breath of fresh air and a reminder that anything is possible
Nov 26 2023,positive,pre show had content not suitable for 4 year old
Nov 26 2023,negative,animation was not bad bunch of easter eggs and funny jokes but would likely not be understood by younger kids songs were mediocre and had a feeling of trying to catch up to encanto character build up was weak making the king a good one to suddenly making him an evil king in an instant  if this was released in the 90s or early 2000s it would definitely go straight to vhs or dvd
Nov 26 2023,neutral,when wish was first announced i had way more expectation for this movie to be something way more and to be honest i was even excited that such a movie was being released for disney 100 im not saying the movie was terrible it had its good moments and partsin fact i did enjoy the old disney movie vibes with the animation style and character references example villain inspos and book beginningend but other than that i barely liked the characters i only enjoyed the main ones the entire plot was so fast and didnt have my emotion or interest hooked at all the comedic times were fine but mostly cringe the music compared to old disney princess music was just not it i did like some songs but even the visuals for the music scenes were so boring and uninteresting hello disney where did that magic go    i dont wanna give a lot of hate to this movie because it wasnt the worst but in general disney could have delivered this movie way better that what they have done to it right now i would not recommend to see it in theaters and in general i dont think i would be watching it again    also can i just mention why are other disney universes tied to this one i didnt like that
Nov 26 2023,positive,an absolutely wonderful movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,disney wish is a temu version of what disney wants to be an actual good movie the villain song was more pop if anything it was nothing like the villains songs back then when they were actually good anyone remember hellfire or friends in the other side hell those were amazing songs but now you got the lame ai song and movie    its crazy how i didnt understand why this film became a meme until i watched it for myself   if this is their 100yrs anniversary movie k wonder what theyll come up with next disney has been lacking in the movie industry and just using old ideas it sucks and could have been better    i watch both trolls band together and wish and i have to say trolls was 10x than whatever  this new movie disney came up with it looked like something an ai would make with each new movie release whether live action or not its pretty much disney losing money
Nov 26 2023,positive,the film is your typical good vs bad or more specifically a nonprincess vs a bad king despite this i got several references of other disney productions from this movie as i didnt watch enough past disney stuff i didnt get all the rest of the references until i read about them online this made me realise how much thought the writers had when making this film the songs are good even though only one or two are memorable the characters are likable as well the story is straight forward enough without having a plothole this is indeed a love letter to celebrate 100th anniversary of disney
Nov 26 2023,negative,could i give less than 12 star oh i would indeed terrible animation no story the villain really why is he so bad the heroine blah and colorless dont spend your money on this onethis movie certainly doesnt come up to the old disney standards for sure embarrassing
Nov 26 2023,positive,best movie this year
Nov 26 2023,positive,nice story but songs could be better and the supporting cast could be better only the lead was great
Nov 26 2023,negative,it was very boring the songs were terrible the jokes fell flat
Nov 26 2023,positive,great movie took 3 grandchildren to see it aged 68 yrs the 6 yr old cried near the end as he thought the king would destroy everyones wishes but left quite happy at the end the 2 8yr olds thought it was great kept everyones attention for 90 mins
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was amazing
Nov 26 2023,positive,like seemingly every movie this year dont listen to the critics  wish is a lighthearted and fun movie for young and old which also celebrates 100years of disney the animation style is beautiful mixing old and new and the songs are catchy as always our group absolutely loved it  will watch it again next week
Nov 26 2023,positive,this is a mustsee for any disney fan it just shows that the old formula good overcoming evilteenage protagonist with a dead parent and animal sidekick can still work in 2023 the songs are catchy and beautifully sung the characters are believable and the message about not accepting injustice from authority figures is inspiring in the words of cinderella they cant order me to stop dreaming the film is also a wonderful way to celebrate disneys centenary with so many hidden mickeys to enjoy overall it felt nostalgic yet fresh funny yet thrilling and a story full of hope excitement and emotion the message that i take from this is very walt disney  if you can dream it you can do it whether you wish upon a star in a wishing well or to a fairy godmother that wish is forever yours to keep and up to you to make come true
Nov 26 2023,negative,the movie has no sense of hair physics and it wouldve just been a bland new gen pixar movie worth 2 stars if ashas hair didnt magically stay over her shoulder the entire time like i get her look is all about that but i mean come on in one scene shes running and the next shes magically fixed her hair for no reason its just a big minor detail but i couldnt stop focusing on it the entire movie all and all the movie try to use the disney secret recipe and what came out with a very rushed and bland movie that left me feeling like i wanted my money and time back please only go if your kids are dying to see it cuz theyre the only ones thatll even enjoy this
Nov 26 2023,positive,awesome moviegreat concept when you wish upon a star may your dreams come true loved the goat and the songs great job disney
Nov 26 2023,positive,wonderful movie beautiful animation music and story very scary villain empowering message
Nov 26 2023,positive,lovely movie with so many nods at an amazing history of movie magic our family loved it
Nov 26 2023,positive,i do believe this is a good movie however i dont believe this is the 100 year celebration disney promised outside of a couple of references to some other disney movies disney made us believe this would be their best movie to date celebrating 100 years of history but that wasnt the case in my opinion it is a good movie but not so much a 100 year celebration for one of the greatest companies ever made with that being said the movie is actually a really good story with amazing songs likeable characters and a very good story upon seeing the animation in the trailers at first i thought it wouldnt be very good but its actually quite nice and pleasant to look at and the disney references are pretty funny its a good movie dont get me wrong but disney shouldve done something even grander for their 100 years when looking at this as a movie and just that a movie its actually really good but if you look at this as disneys 100 year celebration its pretty underwhelming
Nov 26 2023,neutral,this movie is boring doesnt try anything new and just reuses classic disney tropes that have gotten stale over the years if you want to see a new movie that pushes the boundaries and tries something new while also being entertaining this isnt the movie youre looking for
Nov 26 2023,negative,forgettable songs weird forced story gorgeous watercolor background animation take your little kids or just wait for the   to see it on disney
Nov 26 2023,negative,felt like a disney channel original movie done in animation  interesting main character and villain unfortunately there wasnt a compelling story
Nov 26 2023,negative,a forced last minute movie would best describe this disney is desperate to produce anything close to the classics
Nov 26 2023,negative,everything about this film is terrible lazy and just straight up pathetic because the once beloved studio is crashing and painfully burning due to greed of the ceos who are allowing trash such as wish to exist just for a quick and half arsed cash grab    everything about this film is lazily done it all feels like it was made with ai which wouldnt surprise me due to the greed going on at disney the songs animation characters and story are boring dull weak and just painful to look at and hear the film was so boring that the kids barely laughed the audience was mostly silent if disney is wanting to kill themselves they should at least do it with a bang not a silent whimper as the ceos abandon ship with their pockets and fists full of cash     rip disney
Nov 26 2023,positive,my son and i really enjoyed this movie  highly recommended  espcially chris pines song
Nov 26 2023,positive,very cute movie for kids and adults
Nov 26 2023,negative,in the movie now and want to walkout but i have the kids they even seem uninterested the movie lost it disney touch
Nov 26 2023,negative,the movies storycharacters were bad and none of the songs were enjoyable the animation by far was my least favourite part i find it particularly ugly i hate to see that this movie was so bad i tried to have hope for it
Nov 26 2023,negative,total waste of time dont bother with this stinker
Nov 26 2023,negative,dontwhatever you do dont watch this movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,annoying goat cheesy star fat kristoff pitiful plot that has no substance and was not compelling animation was fantastic though
Nov 26 2023,negative,this movie was clearly tongue in cheek written as a feverish attempt to besmirch donald trump and republicans as a whole i think it is spectacular that disney has lost so much money this year and i truly hope they go out of business soon
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was a beautiful return to classic disney storytelling the songs are great and the message is hopeful i have no idea why critics are so jaded
Nov 26 2023,positive,very charming and encanting movie in the end i cried the songs this wish and welcome to rosas were my favourites the only negative i can find is that i found it quite small as a movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,my twin 8 year olds and 10 year old were like warm to going but what a great surprise they and i loved it we played the soundtrack at home teller rest of the night
Nov 26 2023,negative,i just could not get over the main character being a thief to get what she wants
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was ok never really laughed never fully enjoyed it  it was alright that is as far as i can go kind of just passed the time
Nov 26 2023,positive,the kids loved it plenty of classic disney references for the parents the story is imaginative and engaging yet not overly long a bunch of catchy tunes as well that fit well into the plot a great addition to the disney universe
Nov 26 2023,positive,shows family at their best  i will definitely go again and take my grandkids watch through the credits there are some gems there  well done
Nov 26 2023,negative,i took my two grandsons to this movie none of us thought it was all that great rather boring storyline
Nov 26 2023,positive,dont understand what the critics are on about wish was fun for the whole family a love letter to the past but modern and great for our kids lots of easter eggs for adults and disney fans its not breaking new ground but it doesnt  need to the sound track is fab and has been playing in our car for a week just go watch and enjoy and let the critics have thier noise
Nov 26 2023,positive,its good songs are good i love the character asha not much humor like other disney movies
Nov 26 2023,negative,we walked out of the theater about halfway my child is 5 and ive never seen her wanting to stop watching an animation midway before  it was that bad we are guessing that there was a mass turnover within the disney midmanagement these people dont know what they are doing i love the disney franchise so the recent production of bad movies is concerning
Nov 26 2023,positive,had all the qualities you want from a walt disney animation studios film the voice acting and singing is great  the songs are brilliant and most of all nothing in the plot feels overly forced the way they have tied in all the different films from over the years was great for a disney fan and the pre title screen at least in our cinema played a clip from walt which already got me in the disney mood before the film started highly recommend to anyone who loves disney and specifically disney animation
Nov 26 2023,positive,all is very nice pics
Nov 26 2023,negative,the movie was slow and boring with songs that werent memorable and animation that was choppy and grainy at best the storyline was predictable and boring with very little surprise for being disney 100 and such a celebratory year this one left me wishing i would have just waited until i could stream it and save the cost of the 6 tickets that i paid for
Nov 26 2023,negative,way too formulaic  tried too hard to use the successful elements from other movies and landed flat   would not see again
Nov 26 2023,positive,the movie was pretty good it wasnt super great and the motivations of some of the characters were a bit mixed up but if you dont care about all that than id recommend people watch it i also liked the villain and his song was really good in my opinion 
Nov 26 2023,negative,the villain was way too scary for my kids  both my son and daughter asked if they could leave halfway through  they have never asked to leave the movie theater  also animation was a little weak in my amateur opinion
Nov 26 2023,positive,asha is a brave and bright heroine committed to her family and friends the movie moves very quickly and is filled with music and humor
Nov 26 2023,positive,wish is visually appealing experience that struggles to live up to the disney standard
Nov 26 2023,positive,wonderful animation and enchanting story the music and singing were awesome
Nov 26 2023,positive,the story was good the music was great my daughter loved it
Nov 26 2023,positive,the kids really love the movie right through as a parent what i really appreciate about the movie was that the good overcame the evil and when youre bond together with  great determination you can succeed
Nov 26 2023,positive,i actually enjoyed the film as much as i dislike the villains song i dont think its that bad since his song is more upbeat while the heros song is more of a uprising its not a bad film its enjoyable
Nov 26 2023,positive,better than what disney has been doing in strange world the villain is also the most intense villain disney has created ever well maybe behind scar great movie fresh
Nov 26 2023,negative,is this the best disney could come up after 100 years of entertaining and helping kids dream  mediocre it feels as if an ai generated the plot when you put in fairy tales in a program and comes up with the most generic story and music  i expected an adventure with characters from the disney repertoire like wreckit ralph but this time not only cameos but a plot with other princesses or maybe come with an abstract world like fantasia or even soul  the only other way to clean that mess would be a docuseries to let people know about disney for the 100th time and let me go forget about this hour and a half and keep dreaming big with other movies
Nov 26 2023,neutral,the quality of the animation was lower than what i expected for disney i could see sketch marks maybe it was intentional but i didnt like the style cute story and good soundtrack
Nov 26 2023,negative,bad plot villain protagonist story and unremarkable songs its disney but doesnt have any of the disney charm
Nov 26 2023,positive,alan tudyk is a disney legend in the making       the movie is funny and fun  i am glad i didnt listen to the critics  my wife and i both enjoyed it
Nov 26 2023,positive,fun movie for the holiday weekend
Nov 26 2023,negative,movie was really predictable and the visuals were just bad
Nov 26 2023,negative,the story was very predictable which is fine the songs were just ok not even close to a movie like moana  the animation was from the 1980s  it was as if they did this on a shoe string budget not much effort on this one  i know it was to honor the past but it fell short
Nov 26 2023,positive,i watched it yesterday with my daughter german   not perfect but also not that bad definitely better than 51
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was awesome yall are just boring and hate fun
Nov 26 2023,positive,beautiful colors and animations the movie has a message your dreams represent who you are and you cannot let anybody to take them away however the movie is not as attractive as other disney films its too classic a villain and a hero story
Nov 26 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the film the characters were simple but fun and did their roles the songs were great and the animation was stunning i will say though that lyrics were bad in a couple songs along with there being a few too many for a movie only an  hour and thirty four minutes also im aware some people were mad about the whole not celebrating 100 years of disney enough but like just cause its dedicated to their 100 year anniversary doesnt mean the film should be a cheap remix based off of every movie theyve made if i have a million subs on yt that doesnt force me to have to celebrate by rewatching my old videos
Nov 26 2023,positive,ignore the critics this is a childrens movie so lets ask them what do they say they love it every child i know has not stopped talking about it as an avid disney fan this was a great tribute to disneys 100 year anniversary
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was alright in the beginning but started to get really predictable and boring although the movie isnt the worst it still is a movie you can watch the movie is really forgettable and i mean it i watched the movie and already forgot most of it i do think the songs are catchy the villain is kinda weak but not horrible the easter eggs were also fun the goat did feel like it was only just there for looks but whatever thats basically it the movie is alright and mid but still is great family movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,shallow confusing flat characters lackluster animation and uninspiring music  the only thing that would make this movie better is if they had put the short once upon a studio as a leader in this theatrical release rather than dumping it on disney
Nov 26 2023,positive,theres one thing that the film definitely lacks music ariana deboses song this wish is incredible but i really hope that linmanuel or alan menken created the songs for the film the plot is excellent i find no issues with it and i truly enjoy it i had a wonderful experience when i viewed it by myself in the theater i find the villain to be quite appealing i dont mind that the primary character is quirky and endearing after all it works every time easter eggs from many disney films are my favorite its a mustsee so youd best go see it in cinemas and watch it yourself before you criticize it
Nov 26 2023,positive,wish was created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of disney animation the main character who wishes for the stars classic villains animal partners traditional songs and a lot of easter eggs this movie is full of love for the works so far and is a gift for all fans
Nov 26 2023,positive,its a really enjoyable movie greatunique animation style celebrates the d100 perfectly the characters are so fun and theres so many nods to past films it also finally brought back a classic villain king magnifico the story is excellent to inspire us to keep pursuing our wishes because they wont just happen by themselves and was intended to be the first fairytale  must see for disney fans have your own opinions about this movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,the characters are two dimensional pun intended the story is uneventful and predictable and the songs are boring and forgetful even the kids were bored
Nov 26 2023,negative,disappointing disney movie lackluster songs and plot appreciate the nods to other disney films but not enough to carry it
Nov 26 2023,positive,absolutely loved it breathtakingly beautiful a sweet and entertaining story which keeps you entertained the whole time through the songs were delightful and i love star the movie was laugh out loud funny at times and made me tear up the nods to disney classics were wonderful this one will undoubtedly have a beloved place in disney history
Nov 26 2023,neutral,very boring story line
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was a fantastic celebration of disneys 100th anniversary the animation was beautiful and the songs were exciting and catchy the message at the end was heartwarming
Nov 26 2023,negative,the storyline was weak and the characters were all boring expected more from disney pay the writers they make a difference
Nov 26 2023,negative,such a let down i had a terrible feeling about this movie from the start but i wanted it to be good so badly especially since i love ashas design unfortunately my hunch was right the music was god awful the story was bland the animal characters were annoying and the villain had no motivation i didnt care about any of the characters and overall it just felt like a cheap movie meant to rot the brains of toddlers i cant believe disney put this out for its 100th anniversary
Nov 26 2023,positive,not an instant disney classic but a fun watch if you have young kids or siblings its definitely worth taking them dont listen to the reviews and see it for yourself
Nov 26 2023,negative,this is like a copy and paste of previous movies all mashed into one   singing scenes feel forced and unnecessary characters have little to mo charm or uniqueness feels like the same characters used in different movies
Nov 26 2023,positive,a nice film good music inspiring disney fun
Nov 26 2023,negative,this felt too dumbed down it was pretty cookie cutter but i guess they needed something safe to represent the classic feeling of magic i prefer bolder movies but i suppose i get why they did it this way i liked the main characters entourage though they were a fun bunch   would give this more if at least the villain was something more than a generic douche   overall wish was to me a little bit above a special of a princess show on disney junior
Nov 26 2023,negative,the worst disney movie ive seen bad writing mediocre music predictable plot rushed but i was happy to when i got to leave the theater
Nov 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie wasnt a huge fan of the villain reminds me a wannabe gaston and i wasnt a huge fan of the animation i did love asha valentino and the star
Nov 26 2023,positive,disneys 100th anniversary movie goes down a slide with the references some subtle and others shoehorned in but the story is beautiful with an important message     it is difficult for the mouse studio to be able to meet massive expectations generate something at the level of celebration and generate a significant box office like in its good times and well they get overwhelmed with so many things in general the film is beautiful the songs are good with a couple that stand out and one of these made me want to applaud in the end lin manuel miranda is a guarantee     the problem lies in the number of references which when they are subtle it is nice to realize but when they are forced they are no longer so cool but the cringe came when they have to explain the reference for everybody to understand and that was not necessary
Nov 26 2023,positive,what a great movie fun characters good music  my sister and i laughed so much
Nov 26 2023,positive,disney managed to capture 100 years of animation magic and pay homage to all of it in one brilliant beautifully animated film
Nov 26 2023,negative,the plot has promise but overall the film feels clunky and is poorly executed the songs are lackluster the jokes fall flat and the animation is subpar compared to other disney films
Nov 26 2023,positive,family movie night this weekend was disneys wish no spoilers but this was a truly great movie very classic fairy tale the film was full of 100 years of disney nods to all of disneys animation the music rivaled encanto too
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was a great family movie  i like it all
Nov 26 2023,positive,after hearing mostly negative reviews before seeing this film i was skeptical and in some sense rightfully so the film contains some of the best songs from disney that weve gotten since encanto 2021 in my opinion yet it also contains some very questionable ones moreover chris pine and his musical number was the biggest let down of the film for me because it just felt out of place in regards to the other cast members but disney undoubtedly knows how to create an enticing villain it also felt as if most of the film all wonderfully welcome disney cameos excluded  drew way too much from past disney films in terms of plot and followed the safely paved path previously set by former villainsfilms from disneys past regardless ariana debose and alan tudyk were certainly my personal standouts and i will be adding this wish and knowing what i know now my favorite parts of the movie to my disney playlist immediately
Nov 26 2023,positive,enjoyed this movie thoroughly though some parts left my 3 year old nephew a little unsure lots of touches and call backs to older disney movies and lots of new disney magic the ending made me cry and i loved the songs
Nov 26 2023,negative,it felt like they didnt know what to do with this movie it was very safe and very cliche there wasnt any real risk or character development this is probably one of the worst movies disney has made ever if not more like a tv special over a full theatrical release just because i had a bunch of references doesnt mean it was a good movie this reminds me of the episode of uncle grandpa and steven universe crossover uneeded i would have loved it if they would have kept the idea of the wife also being evil and im having a love song together i would have loved the idea of seeing the king actually having a real reason to be a villain over just being bored with narcissism at least with mother gothel  she had a reason to stay young and to keep her magic safe he just was like nah no wishes for you
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was really good me and my daughter both enjoyed the movie it has a good message to it
Nov 26 2023,negative,quality of production as well as story line was poor
Nov 26 2023,negative,poor writing and character development typical disney clichés story had no depth songs are forgettable and not necessary simplistic melodic writing with garbled lyrics due to mediocre craftsmanship jokes fell flat art direction unoriginal with cheap effects
Nov 26 2023,negative,it was very unfinished to me it was boring there was no background of either characters the evil guy talked about oh something bad happened to my family then we never figured out what that wasthen all of a sudden she figures out hes evil in the first few minutes of the movie i wouldnt recommend unless you have toddlers it is not suitable for a tweens teens young adults and adults and elders i would recommend if you want a quick confusing movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,why disney is ass nowdays  this movie sucks ugly unfunny not cool or has a good script and def hasnt the disney magic  get good please disney i miss you good movies  the last really good movie they made was moana and encanto was kinda fun i liked it but thats it
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was adorable with a beautiful old school animation style good pacing a few deep cut disney references  semi catchy music this movie is exactly what it needs to be it doesnt overstay its welcome or try to me something its not solid 810 
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie has condensed everything disney has ever stood for into a single movie it was like watching a picture book   i dont generally get overwhelmed emotionally with movies but with this one i did and the message is one of hope that we need now more then ever  so i make this wish to have something more for us than this with all that is happening in this world we all wish for something more something more then just surviving day to day
Nov 26 2023,positive,great movie it kept mine and my 9 yrs old daughters attention the whole time  she really like it
Nov 26 2023,positive,had me smiling from ear to ear the whole time great music awesome story
Nov 26 2023,negative,it was painful  to watch  terrible plot
Nov 26 2023,positive,this was a very enjoyable movie  my great granddaughter es  of especially liked it
Nov 26 2023,neutral,i really liked some of the music numbers and the story was neat but the animation was extremely distracting and disappointing  the colors were very flat and looked unfinished  encanto was visually stunning and it seems disney worked hard to make wish the complete opposite  if they used the same animation style this movie could have been breathtaking  instead its all i could focus on and i wish disney would have worked to show off what has made them great in the past  sadly this movie isnt the turnaround many were hoping for
Nov 26 2023,positive,loved it totally worth seeing in the theater
Nov 26 2023,positive,i like this movie cause it was celebrating 100 years of wonder cause the movie was so good like the whole thing when the goat was talking to asha
Nov 26 2023,positive,great family movie such a positive and meaningful teaching moment for kids
Nov 26 2023,negative,its was painfully bad it had so much potential but its all lost the songs sound like they were written by ai and the plot has so many holes i guess thats to be expected when you lay off half of your workforce though
Nov 26 2023,negative,animation was tv quality and looked pretty bad i didnt find any of the songs catchy and the villain and main character was not very fleshed out my kids were moderately entertained 
Nov 26 2023,positive,some critics are holding the throwback to disney classic formula against this movie but for me that was a selling point that and my 10 year old lhao at the antics of star made this a five star movie for our family
Nov 26 2023,positive,from the design of the story to the arrangement of narrative techniques wish gives a distinctly disney feel however in a world that has endured so much hardship this kind of film is only suitable for those who have always been dreamers wishing upon disney
Nov 26 2023,negative,visually it was not great and the story wasnt the best 
Nov 26 2023,negative,i dont think im ever going to be the same
Nov 26 2023,negative,both myself and my 7 year old granddaughter thought it was boring  the music at the beginning of the movie was not followable or understandable  would have left had we not paid for the show and food  i wish that i would not have purchased the tickets and waited for it to come out on television   the theater was not cleaned up either  we had to move trash to put our drinks in the cup holders
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was a great depiction of disney magic all over again i personally found all the soundtrack to be amazing unlike many other opinions wish it was a bit longer by 15 mins aprox i felt the story was well written through the songs but some parts felt rushed its a must see if youre a disney fan so happy to see new original content brought to us
Nov 26 2023,negative,kids absolutely hated this movie  they actually asked to leave the theater before the movie was over  i was happy to accommodate their request  awful movie  disney is dead
Nov 26 2023,positive,loved this movie its one of my new disney favorites
Nov 26 2023,neutral,it felt ok but what happened in climax i cannot tell you because it didnt make any sense  but the worst thing is forgettable music because i wasnt humming as i was leaving the theater  these songs usually are so catchy but none found here
Nov 26 2023,positive,enjoyed the music story and visuals  great message on live your life and go for your wish  free will and reject those that want to control you  our group was aged 65 all the way through to 5 we all enjoyed it
Nov 26 2023,positive,we had so much fun loved the music loved the nods to disneys past loved the characters
Nov 26 2023,positive,very cute especially for long time disney fans there are tons of easter eggs the plot is a little cheesy its like a 90 minute show youd see at the castle in disney world nothing world shattering but a fun and uplifting time
Nov 26 2023,positive,cute film  great message   music not as good as other disney films
Nov 26 2023,positive,this is a fantastic vision and love letter to the creativity that has been the heartbeat  to countless disney films the artists who make them and the audiences who delight in the magic it is a stunning display of modern technology that captures the feel of earlier works while presenting stunning images forget the critics take your kids or the kid in you to see this movie its fun and inspirational if you have an open heart and mind
Nov 26 2023,negative,totally disappointed in disney this was a terrible movie bad story weak songs and uninteresting characters not a fun experience
Nov 26 2023,neutral,enjoyable enough but not disneys best disney has come full circle  from jiminny cricket s when you wish upon a star  to this  wish upon a star with disney historical bread crumbs along the way music was good grand sons enjoyed too
Nov 26 2023,negative,we have seen this movie before and before and before and before poor girl is a victim of bias prejudice and wants to prove herself plays the victimblahblahblah
Nov 26 2023,positive,love the story and loved  the music
Nov 26 2023,positive,it felt like a return to form for disney
Nov 26 2023,positive,very fun movie loved all the references to disney movies
Nov 26 2023,negative,this was hot trash im sorry the story felt so boring the attempt at 2d looking 3d was horrible
Nov 26 2023,positive,solid movie kids loved it had a lot of great easter eggs and a cute story highly recommend
Nov 26 2023,negative,had to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen its like it was edited on capcut
Nov 26 2023,negative,this is sad for a disney movie  where are the great movies like tangled and moana  this is just a mediocre and sad attempt to imitate the greatness of a classic disney movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,amazing movie cant wait for the broadway musical  disney done it again
Nov 26 2023,positive,theres so much heart in this movie and the song at all costs moved me to tears a must watch
Nov 26 2023,positive,such a cute movie to see with the family and our  fine arts director at our school is in the choir for this movie and we did not know thatworth seeing for the easter eggs
Nov 26 2023,negative,the weakest disney movie i have ever seen and the first time i considered walking out of a movie it felt ai generated in ifs homogenized blandness i would have sworn the songs were all lin manuel regurgitating old hits so i was shocked that they were written by someone else the plot was thin and the music was forgettable
Nov 26 2023,negative,sure tell children that all their wishes should come true no matter what it is cause your entitled to it there is a reason why careful what you wish for is one of the most oldest sayings in human history and said across other cultures too but whatever its just some stupid words said by an old person and old people are always wrong and younger quirkier and inexperienced teenagers are always right with their more wiser knowledge then that of people whove lived and made mistakes all their life    thankyou again modern disney for ruining the next generation of children by making them even more entitled then before thanks a lot
Nov 26 2023,positive,liked the story but would of like more humor in it
Nov 26 2023,positive,my daughters loved it
Nov 26 2023,positive,all these adults need to relax and enjoy a cute movie with their children
Nov 26 2023,positive,it is a good movie a lot of singing the villian in this film is good but he seem to be good since he did lost his family and he didnt want it to happen again but his actions
Nov 26 2023,positive,the wish was so very good you guys must watch it because it was special for 100 aniversary diseny well this film was not really awesome but for me disney has change in animation
Nov 26 2023,negative,it was like the average disney movie honestly it was mid  the villain song was corny as heckthe main character is mid the goat wasnt even funny at all disney hasnt made a single good movie since encanto the goats jokes were totally 6yearold or 65yearold no in between nobody in the middle would find them funny disney needs to do better
Nov 26 2023,positive,overall a good clean classic disney movie nothing weird for once
Nov 26 2023,positive,great movie with lots of little disney easter eggs and a good story enjoyed all of the songs even though most of them arent the usual earworm looking forward to watching again
Nov 26 2023,negative,a glorified sophia the first plotline with elena of avalor animation it has forgettable love ballads sung to balls of glass and powerful freedom melodies that seem contrived an ode to the fact that were all just dust and that makes us special a wife who happily locks her husband away and enough disney cameos and hidden mickeys that i cant tell whether they are trying to start a multiverse or a cult    it had a lot of everything the recipe says its supposed to have except sincerity and as a result it fell a bit flat    you will enjoy it more if you spend the whole time trying to count all the references to other disney works it works better as a wheres waldo than a standalone film
Nov 26 2023,negative,lazy movie by excel sheet  the animation is jarring where 3d and hand drawn backgrounds just isnt a great choice beyond that it looks unfinished  songs are just that simple pop songs with horrible lyrics the story has more holes than a swiss cheese and it just plain bad  and than we have the nods to 100 years of mostly amazing movies except for the past few years and we get painfully remembered that disney has lost it
Nov 26 2023,positive,i didnt realize the theme was sorcery had i known i would not have gone to see it
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was good but it was missing something enjoyed the movie and the songs were catchy but something was missing
Nov 26 2023,positive,fun movie with a good story plot
Nov 26 2023,neutral,the movie felt flat like the story was lacking something
Nov 26 2023,neutral,wish isnt my favorite movie its a boring story and i i just cant compare it with the other movies i have watched
Nov 26 2023,neutral,i thought the movie was ok but it didnt spark a 100th anniversary like once upon a studio did the story was pretty safe and bland and the main lead though voice beautiful by ariana debose seems like a pale mashup of other disney heroines but with less agency and while having easter eggs in your film is nice and all but just having them cause you can can be a bit distracting lessen the focus and quality of the film if anyone or their family enjoyed it good for them it just felt like they missed the mark to do something better
Nov 26 2023,negative,too much singing  wow  predictable story line even fof kids  total disconnect for my girls first disney movie we left early
Nov 26 2023,positive,mediocre disney film  maybe the kids will enjoy it more
Nov 26 2023,negative,horrible stupid movie boring boring boring animation looks like its form the 90s horrible singing  just plain out boring dont waste your money
Nov 26 2023,positive,it appears with wish that disney tried to replicate the magic of frozen or maybe even moana the main issue right away is that the songs are instantly forgettable frozen had the instant hook of let it go  moana had how far ill go wish has none of that  the story is ok with the typical disney princess defeating the evil bad guy routine but youll leave thinking that this latest disney flick is average at best i will point out that chris pine is an excellent stand out as the evil king in summary young kids should still definitely be very entertained by wish but for anyone older than 10 youll likely think its just ok
Nov 26 2023,negative,a very flat movie i sleep in it the evolution of the characters were poor but animation was greate
Nov 25 2023,positive,the soundtracksongs were excellent
Nov 25 2023,positive,beginning was slow but it progressed nicely
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved it the villain was hot and intimidating the songs and the animation were great definitely a rewatch
Nov 25 2023,neutral,very disappointing at best a 510 and looks like another disney flop doesnt compare to encanto frozen ii and coco nor paw patrol the mighty movie and the super mario bros movie wait until comes out on disney 
Nov 25 2023,positive,good if somewhat standard disney fare  music was catchy but shift in main villains motive seemed stretched
Nov 25 2023,positive,i love wish its a fun story that perfectly balanced between classic disney storytelling with a modern style the songs are catchy animation looks like a storybook comes to life also there are plenty of fun easter eggs i have a feeling this will become the next frozen
Nov 25 2023,positive,it felt like the old disney animated films  it was really well done
Nov 25 2023,positive,my family loved the movie and the music
Nov 25 2023,positive,cute really recommend 
Nov 25 2023,positive,very cute with a good storyline
Nov 25 2023,negative,tbh this movie kinda sucked the music was not that good plus the whole plot is kinda meh not only that the main character asha is very one dimensional and is the main reason for a lot of the problems in the kingdom not to spoil much but shes not great the only 2 upsides was the king and even he was pretty meh and the animation
Nov 25 2023,negative,the plot had so many holes and music was awful
Nov 25 2023,negative,compared to other disney movies this is terrible it had no sense of magic the music is god awful and they scrapped so many good ideas the silence after the jokes was so quiet i could hear someone eat popcorn several rows in front of me there was no dancing too the main character was super duper bland too also chris pine was a terrible choice the song did not fit him and you know how we said the original way sonic looked was so bad they  changed his design we can do that to chris pine voicing characters
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was the most painful and boring watch ever the only good thing was the king being hot the songs were even worse and the humour nearly made me me kms
Nov 25 2023,negative,boring predictable humorless i wish disney had given it a thought that kids were coming to the theater to watch it the movie is forgettable and has no personality everyone from a 3 year old to a couple of teenagers to a 50 year old in our group fell asleep at some point waste of brain cells and money
Nov 25 2023,neutral,my ten year old grandson got bored the movie is probably great for seven year old girls
Nov 25 2023,positive,it is a excellent disney movie and must see for all
Nov 25 2023,positive,so good and many references in the movie for disneys 100th anniversary the songs were good and lots of easter eggs i saw and so many nostalgia
Nov 25 2023,positive,disneys wish  it is fun exciting and endearing   it is original and the icing on the cake of the 100 years of disney studiosthe characters have an attractive design and we love them from the first moment asha heroine princess valentino the sidekick we all miss and even the coolest villain of recent times the animation is unique a mix between 2d and 3d which dazzles on the big screen another element is the freshness of the songs composed by julia michaels nominated for best new artist and winner of the ascap pop music awards which have become instant classics are 7 songs that you can enjoy on digital platforms wish has already been released and is an excellent option to share with the family this season
Nov 25 2023,positive,felt rushed among other things
Nov 25 2023,positive,i love musical movies i received several emails from disney about this movie although i am 73 i still enjoyed watching this movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,i thought this movie was so cute i loved the songs the most and the meaning behind the movie good job disney
Nov 25 2023,positive,entertaining the songs were beautiful would go to watch it again
Nov 25 2023,negative,i  wish  i didnt watch this
Nov 25 2023,positive,positive message great songs  fun finding the hidden references
Nov 25 2023,positive,i just got done watching wish i think it might be one of the most beautifully animated movies disney has ever made and yet it felt hollow and cynical to me i expected to love it i did not but my kids did mostly for the talking goat
Nov 25 2023,positive,this is a throw back to classic disney story telling i loved it even the animation is reminiscent of the disney movies i grew up loving plus all the nods to disney characters through the decades very nostalgic
Nov 25 2023,positive,the movie was great and funny the music was amazing and it has a good story its worth seeing 
Nov 25 2023,positive,i love it its a classic call back to oldschool disney movies and the easter eggs are so fun to see and the music is really good i love the style the characters its a very definite classic of 100 years of disney magic   
Nov 25 2023,positive,nicely done in the style of the old disney classics familyoriented story good for everyone
Nov 25 2023,positive,classic disney storytelling
Nov 25 2023,positive,people are going to say what they say this is a great movie a message of people coming together for something greater  something we all can learn from and my kids loved it too been listening to the songs on repeat since we saw the movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was a horrible convoluted mess
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was not a very interesting story
Nov 25 2023,positive,great story great animation  good music very good family movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,animation style is fresh and nods to both old and new films  the songs really remind you about the magic of disney and the storyline is beautiful it allows for so many nods to different disney films over the years the storyline isnt complex either and is easy to follow making it enjoyable to watch and allowing you to just experience the magic of the film a perfect film for 100 years
Nov 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the plot and the classic movie references not just in the visuals but musically theres references to almost every disney and pixar film the main characters are well developed and the villain is a classic villain good movie i think worthy of being a 100th anniversary film
Nov 25 2023,positive,disney wish 2023 810 its a pretty good films  is not in the level of fantasia 1940 cinderella 1950 or peter pan 1953 or the lion king 1994 but its still a fun film with great music great animation and pretty good characters the plot could be a bit not so great but the message of disney wish 2023 is that our dreams represent of who we are and that its important to do the right thing even when its difficult    i dont get why the critics are protesting about a disney animated film that was already come out 1 week ago and yet the audience specifically myself enjoy the film saying that they love it or they enjoy it with a 87 but the critics just didnt care about watching a film that was already come out  1 week ago instead they are protesting about a disney film 2 or 3 days before even released the movie in theaters yet the critics sometimes like bad movies and they give like 60 of rotten tomatoes  while a good film they only give like a 50 or less  but its depending on what film are we talking about     if disney want to make a successful movie and box office  success they need to focus seriously about creating there own original movies instead of remaking successful disney classic films into disappointment live action films  or else it could be the end of walt disney animation studio completely      but at the end at least disney wish 2023 its a pretty good films  not bad but its not in the level of the previous films except for strange world 2022
Nov 25 2023,positive,colors music and message were cute
Nov 25 2023,positive,amazing heartwarming and wonderful tribute to 100 years
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved this movie so many easter eggs and nods to disney movies of the past i great origin story
Nov 25 2023,positive,the movie is good but some parts do feel at times as too mid
Nov 25 2023,negative,feels like a collection of okay set pieces strung together to make a soso movie  like interns learning to create a musical with little experience in storytelling
Nov 25 2023,negative,boring no story worth being told embarassing songs just remember all the classics they made and then this uninspired stuff for an anniversary sad
Nov 25 2023,positive,music was great strong message loved the disney easter eggs
Nov 25 2023,negative,i was very disappointed by this movie and so was my 4 year old daughter and parents  the this wish song was amazing and so is its reprise but other than that it fell flat for me  i wasnt invested in the characters and i think that was because we simply really dont know much of anything about most them  we knew some wishes but for most of the main characters we didnt even know what their wishes were or much of anything about them      for example if you compare this to tangled we knew the snuggly ducking occupants dreamshobbies  it made them more endearing to the audience and rememberable  encanto songs did the same thing in their songs and it added depth to the movie and further love their characters      the animation seemed low budget when you compare it to encanto frozen tangled ect     the songs were just okay with this wish and its reprise being the exceptions  there were many parts that i cringed because i knew what they were going for but it fell flat and missed the mark for me      i wish it had been more thought out because it could have been amazing and it had so much more potential   it made me wonder if some of the strikes in hollywood effected the movie in a negative way in several areas  for instance they needed to realease it around 100 anniversary even though it wasnt where it should have been    finially my four year old daughter didnt even like it  she said she was bored and scared  she kept doing other things than watch because she said it was boring and even asked to leave  she also hasnt asked to watch it again remember any of the characters or listen to the songs  im fairly certain i liked it more than she did and thats saying a lot
Nov 25 2023,positive,great movie my kids enjoyed every moment of it
Nov 25 2023,positive,my granddaughter loved it nice premise to the storynew and refreshing
Nov 25 2023,positive,believe in your dreams
Nov 25 2023,positive,once more the critics prove our mass media is  out of touch and useless with information  this was a great movie with excellent pacing music art and story  cant wait to watch again
Nov 25 2023,positive,i like wish a lot star is kinda cute and the songs are good
Nov 25 2023,positive,i liked the part when peoples wishes were released and the credits with the old disney characters appeared
Nov 25 2023,negative,i genuinely cannot think of a more boring and lazy disney movie everything from the writing characters animation and music is half baked it looks and feels unfinished
Nov 25 2023,positive,disney magic struck again
Nov 25 2023,positive,its a lovely film disney are tipping the hat to the last 100 years of disney cinema with the return of good magic v evil magic talking animals and refrences to early disney films throughout its a brilliant celebration of classic disney crossed with modern musical theatre its a shame the critics seemed to have missed these nuances that appeal to most of the disney lovers who have enjoyed these films for 100 years
Nov 25 2023,positive,amazing movie my grandaghter abouloutly loved it
Nov 25 2023,positive,beautiful go see if you need your faith restored and stay until the very end
Nov 25 2023,negative,decidedly less than average for story animation and overall effort  disney continues to churn out uninspired stories
Nov 25 2023,negative,the music was horrible and took away from the film first disney film where i was hoping that there would not be another song no tunes words were garbled
Nov 25 2023,positive,the bad guy was like really hot but he didnt have any character development
Nov 25 2023,negative,i thought the story and the music was uninspiring and not memorable  worst disney movie i have ever seen
Nov 25 2023,neutral,this movie is meh not bad not good we felt we didnt waste our time but wouldnt recommend it either songs werent memorable and lacked that charm that films like frozen or brave have but far better than strange world disney misses again
Nov 25 2023,negative,i thought the king was the good guy i was actually waiting to see whos the bad guy in the movie lol i mean i get it everyone wants there wish but how do you know there wish is good or not 
Nov 25 2023,negative,not worth it so much time and money went into something that didnt say anything i long for the days of fun films 
Nov 25 2023,neutral,average nostalgic there were good moments but missed opportunities the butt joke was not funny
Nov 25 2023,positive,i love the beautiful message of this film its something the world needs now the star character is so cute and funny magnifico finally a full on disney villain and ariana debose as asha is perfect i loved the music it has been literally stuck in my head since i left the theater i love the nods to disneys legacy films and be sure to stay until the end of the credits theres a great scene to end the movie which got me a little emotional i cant wait to see it again and see if i can catch more of the easter eggs
Nov 25 2023,positive,the movie was fun to watch for the adults and the kids we laughed throughout
Nov 25 2023,positive,this disney movie is really good the songs are great sing a longs and the story keeps you watching and laughing this will be a classic and my favorite character is the yellow star
Nov 25 2023,positive,wish was everything i had hoped for in a disney classic  the animation was breathtaking  i actually gasped at the beauty of some scenes  the story line was exactly what we need right now  hold on to your dreams and dont let them go  it was full of hope and kindness which our world needs right now thanks disney for bringing this to us i have seen it twice so far and will see it again loved to music as well  hats off to you disney
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved the homage to all the other disney movies and the star was so cute 
Nov 25 2023,positive,kids loved it signing the songs the day after enough call outs to classic disney movies for adults
Nov 25 2023,positive,i have to say i really loved wish it has all of the heart charm and music you would want in a disney film the animation and look is gorgeous i love that you finally get a true villain to the core and star is the cutest character ever i think its a disney classic with some of the best i cant wait to go see it again with my friends
Nov 25 2023,positive,wish is a perfect example of how 100 years of disneys magic can lead to films like this the animation was gorgeous and its nice to have a teenage girl like asha thats close to your age as a 19 year old the songs are beautiful and magical i couldnt help but sing along to them the references are nice to notice go watch this movie and vote for the nominee vote because this movie is a gift to all disney fans
Nov 25 2023,positive,love love loved the movie i cried so many times
Nov 25 2023,negative,well took my two granddaughters7 and 4 to see it and they liked it but they like anything when i plop popcorn and chocolate in front of them visually very good the songs sucked who wrote that drivel sad but disney just does not get it
Nov 25 2023,positive,the movie was good  my granddaughter was a bit scared of th king but she sat on my lap and we made it through the scary parts
Nov 25 2023,positive,not amazing not awful orchestral score pretty good first song with the introduction of rosas was good but the rest of the songs were lackluster not a lot of character development
Nov 25 2023,negative,the visuals are great but the story and music do not deliver villain is somewhat compelling at the beginning but he never develops any further for the 100 year anniversary film you get pop song writers and not actual musical song writers the constant disney references felt like lets make as many easter eggs as we can promote disney as much as possible1 you know in case they forget this is a movie by disney
Nov 25 2023,positive,beautiful scenes powerful story packed with classic disney nostalgia
Nov 25 2023,positive,my kids who are sort of burnt out on disney movies and are over the princess thing really enjoyed wish in fact we all did  the music was great the animation beautiful and to emotional story was interesting  plus it was great to see a real honesttogoodness villain in a disney movie again
Nov 25 2023,positive,great songs and movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,great movie with an amazing message i as adults thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish i took my nieces to watch the movie i did notice at times they would lose interest ages 85 overall they did enjoyed it and i would recommend
Nov 25 2023,neutral,aside from the formulaic and predictable story and a mostly forgettable soundtrack wish still has things to offer like the beautiful animation great vocal performances  and lots of easter eggs however all these things cant save this movie from being so painfully mediocre its just a passable watch and not a movie thats supposed to celebrate the 100 years of disney 
Nov 25 2023,positive,although it is the pinnacle of disneys 100th anniversary celebration disneys wish buckles under the colossal weight of expectation with songs ranging from mediocre to downright atrocious king magnificos big villain song this is the thanks i get is a particular disservice to the ears blatantly ignoring the grandeur and thematic elements that define a good villain song by instead opting for a bland soulless linmanuelmiranda inspired pop beat and a fairly basic story that leaves far more to be desired although some redeemable aspects were ariana debose and chris pines spectacular performances as the two leads and admirable visual risks that paid off in terms of the style of animation overall disneys wish is just about what you would expect from a standard disney fairytale however leaving disney fans truly wishing for something more than this in terms of innovation and story
Nov 25 2023,negative,very disappointed in this movie couldnt believe how much darkness and evil was in it  disney should be ashamed with since so many undiscerning kids will see it very sad
Nov 25 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i think the animation was a great mix of 2d and 3d and the plot was great the movie had some hilarious moments but also had a deeper message i think the idea of wishes are a part of us is a really good idea the songs were really good with my personal favorite being welcome to rosas i think how the wishes move around in at all costs was really cool and the chicken dance was plain silly but entertaining and hilarious 5 out of 5
Nov 25 2023,negative,its a wishy washy mess
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved this movie im so proud of ariana debose having a puerto rican actress represent 100 years of disney makes my heart warm asha is such a great character star and valentino are just adorable i enjoyed seeing all of the easter eggs from previous disney movies
Nov 25 2023,negative,absolutely worst disney film ever made
Nov 25 2023,negative,its official disney is allergic to money
Nov 25 2023,negative,simply just so boring during the whole movie and too much singing when occuring things but not that important the only one i like is the little star silent but kinda lovely
Nov 25 2023,neutral,although the movie had moments of disney magicit was too thrown together and the cgi is much to be desired this movie is not a memorable one for the books
Nov 25 2023,negative,its a regular movie with bad animation and a forgettable story
Nov 25 2023,negative,my wish is that i never took the grandkids to see this bland and boring movie  yeah you know it is boring when the 11 year old pulls out the phone and starts playing a game 15 minutes into it
Nov 25 2023,positive,wonderful love the musics
Nov 25 2023,negative,i had low expectations and it still failed them disney needs to up its game one of the least compelling storylines not to mention the dry and unoriginal music 05 for a professional studio let alone disney
Nov 25 2023,neutral,the line and so i make this wish for something more for us than this fits this film perfectly as it leaves much to be desired in both cinematic and musical substance
Nov 25 2023,positive,this was a cute musical and family movie the many easter eggs thrown in throughout were a cute touch it had some really heartwarming moments and a great message about faith in yourself and the things that make you who you are overall it was a cute and whimsical film that put you in a good mode for the holidays and ignited the belief in wishes coming true despite circumstances that one might not expect it wasnt quite as great as encanto but it was definitely a worthwhile film for a family and had some great original songs that made it a fun and enjoyable experience
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movie is so bad i dont even want to discusssuch a worst experience
Nov 25 2023,negative,a movie i couldnt wait for and it let me down    first the positive  asha was amazing done  loved her look her style she was animated nicely  the wish song when sung by ariana was great but it was the only song worth it imo  chris pines song not so bad but not great either    however i never felt the star was in place with the rest of the movie like it was cut out and put on the screen  which goes with a lot of the scenes in the movie  like they rushed the animation    then theres the story  not great  it couldve been but honestly to do a bit of spoilage in this review the villain didnt seem like a villain until asha didnt like what he was doing even though his reasons made sense and he made a well protected well provided for country  the people didnt even have to give him their wish they wanted to in hopes he could make it happen    he makes valid points she doesnt like it because of her feelings makes a wish on a star and ruins all he built and strived for then he goes on the deep end  disjointed    they need to go back in and reedit andor add in some scenes and touch up the cgi as it feels very rushed in lots of places
Nov 25 2023,positive,if youre going to go to see a movie and look for things to hate about it youll probably find something however if youre looking for a feel good movie with lovely catchy songs and a villain that reminds you how good villains used to be while also being handsome and charismatic then this is a great one to watch i enjoyed every second of it my only criticism is that it wasnt long enough  id love to have seen more of the relationship between king magnifico and queen amaya to really drive home the emotion of the climax of the movie but it is a movie for children and 90ish minutes is probably long enough for them king magnificos two songs at all costs and this is the thanks i get are the real stand out songs for me but this wish is just as lovely
Nov 25 2023,positive,the story premise was fine but the characters were kind of boring the sidekicks goat star were cute but their humor mostly fell flat and it got way too intense and scary in the end for our 6 yearold this will be one disney film my kid wont watch a hundred times
Nov 25 2023,neutral,i liked the music but the story wasnt very interesting had some funny parts but most of it wasnt that entertaining
Nov 25 2023,positive,a great way to celebrate 100 years of disney catchy music lots of humor and tons of easter eggs to point out kids loved it 
Nov 25 2023,negative,its not the disney i grew up watching it the movie quality and art direction is not promising at all and it felt like its not finished and the story is so on the surface that i barely got connected to the characters  sorry disney for whats happening to you
Nov 25 2023,positive,this isnt an instant disney classic but is enjoyable there are tons of callbacks and easter eggs from all over disneys catalog most of the songs are good with a couple that are excellent definitely worth watching and will probably see it again
Nov 25 2023,positive,the characters and style were nice but there was no real growth on the part of asha and king magnifico though a great character we poorly written how did he convince his wife and a whole ton of people he was good if he really was a selfish jerk the whole time it doesnt feel believable and lot of lot logical issues are just scooted under the rugs it feels like it could have been an amazing movie but they tried to do too much or made too many revisions if you had just made magnifico good in the beginning but slightly paranoids out of concern for his people his part of the story might have played out better the book would have still affected him and the wishing star would still want to set the wishes free but the point of contention might have been more clear
Nov 25 2023,positive,i thought this was a very cute movie that honored many past disney movies i wish there was a little bit more of a background on how king magnífico got to power and why he was benevolent to his people but regardless it made me cry and it was moving
Nov 25 2023,positive,it hurts to only give this movie 3 stars though i appreciate what they were trying to do here however the protagonist doesnt really grow or change through the movie and it feels like so many ideas went unpolished i miss the disney that wasnt afraid to take chances the disney that didnt solve every problem so simply this movie hands its female lead a win she didnt really earn while most everyone around her does more to make the ending possible not to mention the whole deus ex machina ending based on something that is actually the most disney thing i can think of cute but not really satisfying
Nov 25 2023,negative,disney definitely paid some people to force rate this up
Nov 25 2023,positive,my daughters loved the movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,very nice plot but the effect between 2d and 3d were just  meh better shading
Nov 25 2023,positive,only thing that stopped it from 5  is the music was not as good as i have come to expect from disney
Nov 25 2023,positive,it relied too much on familiar stuff from the past without anything new because of that the characters are forgettable or obnoxious  songs sound generic story so cliched not well written but the animation was so beautiful but the animation on the character models doesnt mesh that well overall not a bad movie but not a good one entire just okay 254
Nov 25 2023,negative,a lot of disney refs but the film feels soulless empty the animation is beautiful tho
Nov 25 2023,positive,really loved this movie great story even held the attention of 2 four year olds
Nov 25 2023,positive,the music was excellent very sweet storyline also the composer of the music lives right here in bend oregon
Nov 25 2023,positive,my little one loved it we enjoyed it also critics are poor judges of childrens movies 3d was solid also
Nov 25 2023,positive,beautiful movie  new characters and storyline  the family and i really enjoyed it      the music was soso but the art and animation were wonderful

Nov 25 2023,negative,no plot story lacks  good for 6yr old kids painful for anyone older
Nov 25 2023,positive,a sweet movie that reminds us all to keep our wishes close to our hear
Nov 25 2023,negative,wish was not the disney jewel i had hoped for the movie however tries it focused so much on paying tribute to the pastthat the story feels like it was built around those tributes instead of going back and adding the nodds after the story was written the combo styles of animation didnt work i  also really disliked the music you dont come out of it humming the villain at one pointfelt like an actual villain it was lost at the end when he was left alive the goat was genuinely funny some of the animation was prettybut not as breathtaking as it has been in the past the story is forgettable as much as it is weak wish will start off big and bold like a fireworkand fizzle just as quick in the endworth a watch but you wont need to own itand it wont leave you wishing for more
Nov 25 2023,positive,happy 100th anniversary to one of the greatest movie studios in the history of cinema wish is a visually striking masterpiece that makes all of our wishes come true with so much magic at the heart of it all
Nov 25 2023,positive,i honestly have no idea where all the negative critic rating came from i thought this was an amazing disney movie it had heart a moral a real villain finally it had easter eggs for other disney movies and great voice acting chris pine was amazing if youre a disney fan at all do yourself a favor and go watch this movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,great balance of disney magic and tribute to disney animated classics hero and villain were true to their roles

Nov 25 2023,positive,it was a sweet and entertaining movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved the movie i never go into a 90 minute kids movie and expect something earth shattering but j enjoyed the art music and feel of this movie i took away 12 star only because the little animal song i could have done without 
Nov 25 2023,positive,wish is a wonderful homage to the to classic disney heartwarming and inspirational with great easter eggs of the classics

Nov 25 2023,positive,this is my new favorite disney movie 100 going to see again like tomorrow
Nov 25 2023,positive,i wasnt excited because of the reviews but really enjoyed it it wasnt an instant classic like moana but still better than most animated movies my daughter also loved it
Nov 25 2023,positive,i really enjoy the story and the characters it was really amazing i also enjoy asha and her friends rising up to save rosas its amazing to see the movie i highly recommend watching it again and others to watch it too its a masterpiece
Nov 25 2023,positive,another gem from disney this is a feelgood movie that reminds us of the importance of believing in what makes you happy
Nov 25 2023,positive,wonderful story amazing music
Nov 25 2023,positive,very entertaining family movie so great to be able to just enjoy a film and smile and think about how cute the characters are and it gives such a beautiful message
Nov 25 2023,positive,this movie was made with a lot of heart love and pays true homage to the past 100 years of disney thoroughly enjoyed the journey it takes us on and reminds us of the heart of disney magic and that it lies within us
Nov 25 2023,positive,we took our grandkids ages 3 and 7 who loved the simple story while we enjoyed the trip back in time fueled by disney memories
Nov 25 2023,negative,the story is inconsistent characters dont ever develop and i dont quite like the visuals as they seem half baked for a disney film the songs are good though
Nov 25 2023,positive,movie was great my 8yr old granddaughter loved the movie and the message
Nov 25 2023,positive,i thought it was magical
Nov 25 2023,neutral,its a wholesome moving with ok enough characters beautiful animation but it felt very generic allaround the plot and dialogue followed a common trope nothing groundbreaking here at all i enjoyed being with my family but if all things were equal we would have just watched it at home if you want something to do its not a terrible way to spend 15 hours
Nov 25 2023,positive,very cute and funny and too scary
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was fun spotting easter eggs of previous disney films throughout the movie  and there are a ton of them  but the movie itself feels like it was halfheartedly written over a long weekend if i didnt know it was a disney film i wouldve thought it was from a totally different studio the songs were disappointing and while there were a few cute parts the script overall was weak
Nov 25 2023,negative,pretty lame story unrlatable characters  songs were ok
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was really bad man the pacing was all over the place the songs were incredibly lackluster the villains arc was disjointed and confusing and thats putting it mildly the jokes were groanworthy and overall i wish i had just pirated this load of junk
Nov 25 2023,positive,i liked the flow of the movie and the interesting references you can see throughout it to disneys earlier works it gave it yet another layer for the older generation to reflect on all of the past movies while still having a nice story line for the younger ones to watch
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved that they gave a young girl the part of a hero  also loved the theme that you dont let anyone else take away your dreamswishes no matter who they re
Nov 25 2023,positive,we liked the movie and especially the ending
Nov 25 2023,positive,was pleasant enough for my young daughter but for anyone over the age of 4 or 5 i imagine this is going to be pretty forgettable
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved it lots of singing and cute characters
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved the character asha but i feel like the movie itself was very disappointing and unmemoriable there was only one good song in the entire movie that asha sings midway and everyone sings again at the end the movie lacked the usual humor found in other disney films the villain was ok other than the unintelligible songs he sang also i thought it was odd how his wife the queen who seemed to love him dearly suddenly didnt mourn the loss of her husband in the end   there were good elements in the film but disney really missed the mark they had easter eggs throughout the film in reference to other disney films in my opinion they could have enhanced the feeling of nostalgia in the film by making the characters actually look like those referenced bambi could have looked like bambi the rabbits could have looked like thumper the mice could have looked like those in cinderella the bear could have looked like baloo etc etc  my 9 year old daughter loved the film
Nov 25 2023,positive,despite the critical selfimportant critics wish lands exactly where it should  as a fun heart warming and inspiring movie loved it
Nov 25 2023,positive,i liked the music plot  scenery
Nov 25 2023,negative,wish is one of the worst films in the history of walt disney animation studios
Nov 25 2023,positive,ok movie had my two kids here they enjoyed it maybe next time some jokes for adults implemented with finess would had been nice that way it would be more watchable as an adult ok all in all
Nov 25 2023,negative,mark this dayfor the first time ever i have walked out of a disney musical movie for being just so awfulmusicallythat i could not bear to waste my time sitting through the remaining movie and yet wish has pushed me to this point    i dutifully sat through the first song never the best song but necessary to set up the world hoping for better by the 20minute mark song 2 came onandi walked out before the song finished just so bad    pop music songwriter julia michaels was 100 the wrong choice for this show the story is not strong enough to overcome the terrible music and lyricsand we all know that good music can save a subpar story     i hate that i hated this enough to walk outof a disney musical movie i never thought id see the day
Nov 25 2023,positive,this movie was amazing its one for the whole family and i think this is just what the company needed theyve been trying so hard to make new content that all they needed was a classic and yet it still stands out  ariana debose asha has such a beautiful voice and you wont get tired of her when your little ones play her song at home  this movie truly is the perfect movie for disneys 100th anniversary overall an amazing story and a must see for the whole family 
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved loved loved it  if you are a disney fan this is well worth watching
Nov 25 2023,positive,very sweet movie the star and goat are just too funny and adorable
Nov 25 2023,positive,very historical disney feel good family fantasy movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,i like this moviei lot to learni like the musicand was entertaining
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was absolutely wonderfulfunny and touching  we saw it in 3d and the animation was amazing  there were a lot of underlying themes and lessons to be learned from the movie  this will be our new favorite movie for a long time and we dont usually consider animated movies to be favorites at all even if theyre well done but that is how amazing this movie was to us  very well done disney  what a great movie to celebrate 100 years
Nov 25 2023,negative,chris pine as a villain no fucking thank you
Nov 25 2023,positive,not bad not great some characters were cute songs were forgettable hardcore disney fans will probably love it
Nov 25 2023,positive,i was disappointed in the movie i took my grandkids and they liked it okay but were not thrilled nor singing the songs on the way home none of the songs were memorable the movie started very slow and didnt become fun until the animals and plants started talking i dont think this will be a big hit people may go just because its disney and the holidays hopefully future ones will be back up to par
Nov 25 2023,positive,too advanced for a 5 year old not as charming as frozen
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved the story line we took our 3 year old grandson and he watched the whole movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was great could not have been better
Nov 25 2023,positive,the movie was a fun adventure with good music the pacing could have been better and we wished the side characters were fleshed out a little more but it was a good movie i would recommend for kids that its probably more for the 8 10 year old range my 6 year old had a hard time remaining focused on the movie during the talking parts but loved the movie she even clapped and cheered at the ending
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved this disney movie  in the end the peoples wishes win b
Nov 25 2023,positive,side characters and the songs other than the main song fell flat i have to say in my opinion the villian was great they were legit crazy and twisted in a maleficent way enjoyed that loved the disney easter eggs also other than asha villian the goat and starthe other characters were boring though
Nov 25 2023,positive,i really loved this movie ariana is amazing as asha star really steals the show and i love how magnifico goes into full villain mode the music is fantastic and is stuck in my head  i cant wait to go see it again
Nov 25 2023,negative,unimaginative lazy absolute drivel this films attempts at insisting on itself leaves the soul weary and the mouth full of vomit i enjoyed my wisdom tooth removal more than this sorry excuse of a film
Nov 25 2023,negative,i like disney and all but not the best movie they made i know they can do better
Nov 25 2023,positive,disney have done it i loved  wish loved the story the music got tears in my eyes when the movie was over im so happy disney creating magic again
Nov 25 2023,positive,i love the old meets the new water colors meet new tech the songs were wow the cast of old charators blend with new so cute stay to very end even past credits for a surprise
Nov 25 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it had so many references to other disney movies and had a wonderful animation it also had amazing songs and a classic but good message about never giving up on your dreams
Nov 25 2023,positive,the reviewers got this one wrong its like they saw a bad review and then dogpiled instead of having their own opinions they all say the same thing the nostalgia frequently mentioned is used sparingly the story stands on its own merits go see it
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was not good forgettable story and character the main character was not funny or amusing and i wish the main villain won edit i saw the movie again and its worse than i remembered so im lowering the score
Nov 25 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen and im 67 made me cry
Nov 25 2023,positive,the songs animation and disney easter eggs and star

Nov 24 2023,positive,it was such a great movies my grandkids loved it
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish was such a pleasant surprise it had a lot of heart emotional moments that hit hard a funny and eclectic cast an actual villain a strong heroine beautiful music and a story worth telling its a brilliant return to the heart of disney movies and what makes them special and i hope that wish and elemental are marking a transition back in the right direction for disney and pixar my kids loved it i loved it and we will definitely be watching it again when its on disney
Nov 24 2023,positive,who are these critics wish has cute nostalgic nods to the classics while telling its own story chris pines capturing of this wishobsessed king turned power hungry villain reflects a quick descent into madness our heroine understands she cant save everyone on her own and brings the team together it has talking and singing animals beautiful artwork and just enough emotion worth a watch
Nov 24 2023,positive,my daughter who is 10yrs old really liked it and that was the main thing  however it was no where as good as some past disney cartoons  the characters were hard to connect with and the music as only so so  not horrible and not amazing
Nov 24 2023,positive,i love the movie so much i love the characters i love the songs i love the villain i love every thing i give wish a 100 out of 10
Nov 24 2023,negative,an awful attempt at a fairytale with no plot the ending of the movie was purely nonsensical and idiotic this movie left me with more questions than answers and after watching this movie i would not like to get any answers this would mean watching this again this movie is from wishcom i let you live here for free and you dont even pay rent
Nov 24 2023,positive,in spite of some small clichés this movie tells a wonderful story about believing in yourself to make your greatest desires possible i really liked the songs in this one especially the reprise of this wish star is adorable and asha has the courage and determination that ive always aspired to have great movie and a wonderful tribute to animation
Nov 24 2023,positive,loved the musical aspect kids said it was too simple

Nov 24 2023,negative,the 45 mins were awful the new old style  of animation belongs in an old movie theater and looks really really dated  wait until its on the disney tv it wont take long
Nov 24 2023,negative,so disappointing great singers bad writing
Nov 24 2023,positive,very entertaining for our 5  7 year old granddaughters
Nov 24 2023,negative,top 10 worst movies i think ive ever seen
Nov 24 2023,negative,there is nothing special here people will like it because the kids will autolike it so its something new to entertain the children but disney seems to be losing the magic that made rememberable stories
Nov 24 2023,negative,seriously the worst disney animated movie in a decade at least  not one good song  really dull kinda terrrfying for littles  avoid at all costs  stay clear
Nov 24 2023,positive,wonderful movie it delighted my 5year old granddaughter it was disney magic at its best great cinematography and music soundtrack
Nov 24 2023,positive,my son and i liked it we really like the star in the movie and bought the light plush toy at target before seeing the movie it has a great message and i was pleasantly surprised by the quantum psychics component that we are all stars the main character was very likeable
Nov 24 2023,positive,critics forgot how to have fun movie is a great time with fun songs
Nov 24 2023,negative,none of this makes sense with any previous movies that has came before it vapid and soulless and more importantly dumb
Nov 24 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it loved all the nods to previous disney movies the songs were great and i loved all the characters
Nov 24 2023,positive,this is the 100th movie we needed asha is an amazing character and the music is gorgeous
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was a really fun and super magical disney animated movie it had really stylish animation really wonderful voice cast really fantastic characters really cool action really phenomenal fantasy really magnificent comedy really terrific adventure really astounding music really impressive easter eggs really well done visuals and a really fascinating story in my opinion i think its the perfect movie to honor disneys 100th anniversary i really recommend this movie to both kids and adults
Nov 24 2023,neutral,forgettable songsstory didnt feel totally flushed out
Nov 24 2023,neutral,i cant recall the last time a disney animated musical released in theaters and felt this bland and unremarkable home on the range comes to mind but i rented it once when i was like 7 and hardly remember a damn thing about it for something thats meant to commemorate 100 years of the studio its quite unremarkable and in fact may end up lost to time
Nov 24 2023,positive,loved this movie brought all the disney magic i was hoping for the animation was absolutely beautiful the main character asha is absolutely amazing and the villain was great as well  the soundtrack is probably one of my favorite disney soundtracks in quite some time
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish succeeds as a celebration of 100 years of disney animation and a love letter to fans the film is made in the spirit of disneys fairy tales with nods to the classics ariana dubose and chris pine deliver magical performances in a story for all ages about the power of and importance of wishes and the need to treat them with care take your family and enjoy
Nov 24 2023,negative,left the theater feeling very underwhelmed it was ok but nothing spectacular
Nov 24 2023,negative,animation was subpar especially for disney the story was a bit boring and unlikable
Nov 24 2023,positive,a fun original story about the power of wishes my 5 year old loved it i wish adults would stop demanding that all kids movies be written for their interests
Nov 24 2023,negative,they portray the main character as the hero where in fact she is an entitled child who thinks she is the hero where in fact she is the villain
Nov 24 2023,negative,yeah pretty rotten  i wouldnt pay watch this movie lucky i have amc a list  not original and not fun  i almost fell asleep tbh
Nov 24 2023,positive,while maybe not the all time greatest disney movie ever made the songs were great the visuals stunning and was a perfect family movie for the holidays 
Nov 24 2023,positive,i loved how inclusive the characters are the lead character does not impose the pressures of being a princess or having a love interest other than her family  village plus the slight references to past disney movie classics is something an older person can appreciate
Nov 24 2023,negative,went and saw this with my family 5 yearold was the only one who liked it even the 9 yearold hated it songs sounded like a catastrophic mix of sondheim and linmanuel miranda feels like a bunch of different plot lines it wasnt funny at all and the characters were poorly written in general definitely has the vibe of a bunch of different departments that wanted certain plot lines all in one this movie was so bad that i felt like i wanted to punch someone the entire time would not recommend
Nov 24 2023,positive,i saw this movie on thanksgiving and thought it was just terrific the story was interesting with some twists at the end and ariana debose was fantastic
Nov 24 2023,positive,liked everything didnt like that we dont know what the mothers wish was
Nov 24 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie it wasnt a 10 but it was at least a 7 the characters are interesting the story is original and the music is great the easter eggs were fun to find i think people are just not giving it a chance
Nov 24 2023,negative,boring nothing special to it if you like a musical this is definitely the movie for you but if your anything like me its just something to pass the time
Nov 24 2023,positive,not sure what exactly the professional critics were expecting but the kids and adults in our family really enjoyed the film and its message if youre on the fence maybe pay more attention to the user reviews on this one than the critics its a cute movie that earns its place among the animated classics and a fitting theme for the 100th anniversary film
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish is almost perfect animation film but it has some flaws on itspecifically on editing of the film some screenplay issues and felt rush a phenomenal performances from ariana debose as asha debose embodies asha phenomenally as i watched it like it is ariana debose self portrayed another roledeboses voice is a chef kiss on the ears same as chris pines king magnifico magnifico the newest disney antagonist youll love and hate at the same time my issues about king magnifico is lack of what his motivation behind of his selfish as he is and narcissistic way  the other supporting characters are also great yet lack of appreciationappearances on screen  songs are also phenomenal written as the story goes on at the same time julia michaels benjamin rice  dave metzger gives us new classic disney songs the songs  musical scores are the crowning glory of the film along with the animation style  i wish they more been polished in film editing and storytelling perception and still i felt the magic of disney despite of flaws gives me again alive my inner child in it felt happy while watching  still the animation film is a perfect centennial anniversary celebration and the happiest feeling to watch for
Nov 24 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie very very much all of the little cameos and references were great all throughout the movie the animation was beautiful and the songs throughout the movie were fun and enjoyable this movie definitely nailed it with the movie being like one of the classics a simple but interesting plot fun characters a purely evil villian and magic
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was adventurous funny  exciting
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was okay its entertaining and oh so magical the good is that it checks all the necessary elements of a good disney film the bad is that it had several interesting concepts that had a lot of potential but unfortunately wasnt explored effectively but overall nice movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was okay at best i understand what they were going through with the story idea but while the animation was good their mistake ended up being that disney was too focused on the easter eggs and the character design ended up being too similar to a character from lightyear but asha and valentino are both very entertaining so points for that
Nov 24 2023,positive,fun enjoyable family movie fun to see in 3d
Nov 24 2023,negative,further evidence that disney lost its magic a long time ago
Nov 24 2023,positive,im not going to deny that the animation is excellent i like to see how its so fluid and that the background is literally like seeing a very well done painting but the story didnt light a spark that made me say wow what a surprise since at the beginning of the movie they show us that the villain has a painful past and has a mural that represents him but then they forget him and now they say the bad guy just wants to be bad because yes and he wants to be the only one with power and i didnt like that but i did like the references to other disney movies
Nov 24 2023,positive,good new songs  a movie with a true evil villain that was defeated  an ethnically diverse cast that did feel forced  great references to classic disney while still telling a new story
Nov 24 2023,positive,i loved this movie i loved the disney references and songs
Nov 24 2023,positive,i loves wish movie is beautiful  cute  star  is cute  wish song is my favorite in wish movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,terrible plot even worse music not a fan of this style of animation either yet another stinker for disney
Nov 24 2023,positive,magical disney film asha is a great character and i loved star
Nov 24 2023,negative,wow  it is sad to see  how disney is failing disneys magic has gone they are done save your money and time badly animated badly written and poor graphics
Nov 24 2023,positive,amazing movie i loved every second of it
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie is not great of course i am just going on on my granddaughters opinion even she is seeing the w0k3 joke stuff in movies she should love we are done with going to see any disney product in the theater
Nov 24 2023,negative,let me make this quick since i dont want to spend any time on this movie bad things  the animation looks unfinished and lifeless  the chatecters feel lifeless  the story is rushed and the main premise makes no sense  the songs feel ai generated  and main villain isnt really even a villain    it just is such a boring lifeless movie and i wasted an hour and a half of my life on it
Nov 24 2023,positive,i grew up on disney films they are whimsy and magical as soon as i saw that classic book and font i started to tear up with emotions     this film was the type of movie ive wanted from disney for a long time it has that fairy tale vibe while also sliding in more modern values i hope they continue to make movies like this
Nov 24 2023,positive,vey enjoyable  the theme of the movies is fabulous  i love how so many different movies were incoporated into this movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,i thint this movie is pure wishand i like it alot whay are criticism so harsh i cant get it but i will say we have to many clashes from critics vs public its pure manipulation  simply can find nothing bad so why so horrible score is beyond reason  but i say gave the movoe the chance dobt listen criticism
Nov 24 2023,negative,2 stars one for the effort to recreate the all animaton from the 90s and one for the villian the rest waste of time
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movie gives nostalgia feels from the very beginning from the old disney movie start with the story book opening to all the cameos and references throughout its truly magical the story telling and the music makes it a really good movie and stick around through the credits for all the easter eggs and the end credit scene
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was inspiring and had beautiful songs and graphics
Nov 24 2023,positive,in my opinion wish was such a great movie the characters and the story were great and the animation style was phenomenal asha is so fun and energetic and she reminds me so much of all the disney princesses there were a few scenes that almost brought me to tears and im glad it did overall wish is an excellent movie to celebrate disneys 100th anniversary
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was really good liked the fact that it teaches you to hold on to your dreams and wishes can come true  music was very nice
Nov 24 2023,positive,my 97 and 5 loved it  lots of fun little easter eggs to movies of disney past and the star is adorable  the villain is a little scary at one part for true littles but it was very enjoyable for my family
Nov 24 2023,negative,i typically love disney movies but this was awful  the storyline was odd and the characters were underdeveloped  the music was good but the lyrics seemed forced so the songs were meh  im not sure what story disney was trying to tell in this movie  perhaps if they tied wishes to life purpose it would have made more sense  would not recommend this movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,as a final result i can say that wish is a pleasant film but it does miss the title of the film that celebrates 100 years of great stories a shame because behind this project there was talent more than capable of delivering something of the caliber that we know disney can create a nice film that i hope prospers due to its great protagonist and very charismatic villain and that apart from some good songs a good message that is not entirely well told and a flirtatious animation i dont think we are facing a disney classic as it sold so much
Nov 24 2023,positive,the amount or tributes to previous disney animated films is what what made me love the movie there were so many  too many that i dont think a casual disney movie goer would catch it made me absolutely love this movie the story line was just okay so i can see some not really being into it
Nov 24 2023,positive,i loved all of the past disney movie references wish was a great tribute to the 100 years of the disney corporation i wish it was more of an origin story of the fairy godmother from cinderella but there are a lot of great moments in the film it is not an epic princess movie like frozen or the princess and the frog but i enjoyed it
Nov 24 2023,negative,agree with critics on this  remember when disney was for whole family 
Nov 24 2023,negative,an homage is one thing a movielength ad for disney with no narrative center no compelling or memorable characters and songs that sound like they were churned out by the worst kind of ai algorithm is another i will not get the hour and a half of my life back that disney stole from me for this one but i can take a few minutes to write this review in the hopes it will save you from my fate so i make this wish to see a film that sucks less than this
Nov 24 2023,positive,my family has been looking forward to seeing the movie wish and it did not disappoint we loved it the animation and movie is incredible my son had a smile on his face during all the songs as a disney kid and now adult i loved the messages of the film of wishing on a star of not giving up on your dreams also the feeling of speaking your heart even when it is difficult this movie is pure disney magic and a must see i cant get the song wish out of my head such an amazing song
Nov 24 2023,negative,felt like a cheap straight to vhs barbie movie from the early 2000s the animation was terrible 1 good song characters were forgettable and lacked any substance felt very on par for what disneys putting out now adays
Nov 24 2023,negative,very boring  fell asleep halfway through  you might have a different opinion though
Nov 24 2023,positive,if this was the first disney movie i had ever seen i probably would have loved it it has a good story good music and was mostly enjoyable to watch it was also child friendly and my 3 year old stayed fully engaged the entire film it doesnt preach at you or push any boundaries which has been one of the most annoying aspects of recent filmmaking in my opinion  unfortunately i have seen other disney classics however and it falls a little flat in comparison the movie is way too meta for starters instead of hidden little easter eggs it practically slaps you in the face with them repeatedly you will be egged the entire movie secondly the animation is largely decent but dont watch the mouths too closely they look like muppet mouths half of the time i was somewhat surprised at who was and moreso who was not redeemed in the film it seems like a wasted back story and character build up but whatever it doesnt break the film but the storytelling is a little weak in that area aside from those things it was a decent film and i recommend it
Nov 24 2023,positive,the easter eggs are delightful and there were many the story shows the complexities of personal relationships than any other disney movie i can think of
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was beautiful and a true homage to disneys legacy of magical animation i will definitely be watching over and over throughout the years
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish  was amazing loved it from beginning to end a wonderful movie to celebrate 100 years it made me feel like a kid again 
Nov 24 2023,positive,a stunning love letter to classic disney animation whilst also feeling modern and fresh found myself tearing up throughout one for any disney fan heres to the next hundred years 
Nov 24 2023,positive,something original definitely hitting the heart strings the music and storyline were so good
Nov 24 2023,positive,i think the reason why critics are being so cynical about wish is because disney had the audacity to celebrate themselves why shouldnt they theyve been making people laugh cry feel seen and heard for a hundred years why shouldnt they celebrate that this movie is purposefully nostalgic bringing in memories from films that weve known and loved since we were kids the message is beautiful the music is fun and catchy my kids absolutely loved it want to see it again to everyone on the fence about seeing this movie because of what the internet says dont listen to these bitter jealous people go see it its entirely magical and all around a gorgeous and enjoyable story and message  for all ages
Nov 24 2023,negative,no bad disney off the couch
Nov 24 2023,negative,the animation was beautiful  the premise of the movie was good but the storytelling and script was subpar  it lacked the disney magic that was part of their movie making in years past  allinall a disappointment
Nov 24 2023,negative,how is it possible that 20000 people worked on this film i challenge you to sit through all the credits disney is in the dumps
Nov 24 2023,positive,the chicken dance was fabulous
Nov 24 2023,positive,if you are a huge disneyfan you really need to watch this movie this movie include all the memories of disney and has a lot of beautiful songs but the plot is very scrawled and the story id moving forward too fast and in my opinion wish cant represent the 100 years of disney
Nov 24 2023,negative,one word to describe it  boring it takes a lot for a disney movie to end up in a position where the villain and dancing chickens are the only two interesting things plot wise everything else is a copy of what was already there and ultimately makes it into a bland mash of scenes characters and jokes that are picked up from various disney productions and mixed together like some leftover stew even music is not helping here the animation is definitely not worth the gigantic money disney spent on this and the ending sends a message that people should still count on someone else to make their dreams come true
Nov 24 2023,positive,one can only hope this is just a period of junk food nostalgia and pandering
Nov 24 2023,positive,its disneys biggest comeback hit a must see a return to form with stunning animation dazzling visuals and a mega disney win
Nov 24 2023,positive,well done and inspiring
Nov 24 2023,negative,i think i preffer the dentist than this movie there i only have discomfort but with the generic product my eyes earns and  sense of wonder get hurt
Nov 24 2023,positive,really magical movie et wonderful songs
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish feels like a modern disney classic watched this after thanksgiving dinner with my family and it was the perfect way to end the night would definitely recommend ignore the critics scores and watch wish for yourself if youre a fan of disney classics youll love wish
Nov 24 2023,negative,serious regrets about watching this movie     about 20 of us went thanksgiving day most of us had seen no previews at all and had no prrconceptions at all about the movie yet all but two of us pretty much loathed it it almost made me literally mad that this was considered good enough to put in theaters and waste our time and a good amount of money     no redeeming qualities everything was generic the animation was awkward the dialogue was bland and boring the messaging was weak and basically nonsense the music had a few catchy moments that made me think they might be going somewhere good before it died off into boredom     lets see what else   i laughedsmiled zero times theres no characters worth getting attached to the character behavior is awkwardly unrealistic example the queen and the resolution is super cliche and makes so much of the movie feel pointless   there was one joke about 910ths of the way through that was actually fairly funny but by that time i was so numb that i couldnt crack a smile the theater agrees silent the whole time no laughter that i ever heard the funny animal sidekick was completely not funny despite several terrible attempts we had multiple kids in our group two and up who ended up ignoring the movie because it didnt interest them any more than it did the adults a 14yearold and 21yearold female thought it was okay but thats the best reactions we had to it     it felt like they had the staff that makes the preschool tv shows from disney channel create a whole movie with the same animation style and calibre if jokes and sell it as a feature film and yet again our preschoolers didnt like the movie either     i am not a dry person i laugh and joke a lot i enjoy movies of many different genres including maaany kids movies but this was really just the worst   i almost feel bad being so negative because there are probably people that contributed to this film that are really proud of their work but its hard to stay silent here because i want to save others from it if i can     is this an example of a consequence of the writers strike did chatgpt write the bland script for this   the voice acting was decent overall but that will only take you so far     please dont pay full price for this movie if you need to watch it for some reason
Nov 24 2023,negative,30100 goddammit disney this is the thanks we get the animation reigns supreme and chris pine is amazingbut the rest oof it makes me wanna gag
Nov 24 2023,positive,i had my hopes low as id heard all the negative anticipation regarding the music and the animation style but i loved it     the animation looked 100x better on the big screen and was visually captivating and magical the characters were lovable and asha was awesome i surprisingly enjoyed the king villain he was funny but also evil  something disney has avoided for some time     the story was not overly complicated and reminded me of the older classic disney movies where the storylines were very direct this is likely due to the shorter run time     there were plenty of easter eggs for other disney movies and i kinda hoped they would have been part of the storyline and not simply easter eggs     regardless it was visually stunning kids were singing along to the songs and i was smiling the whole time so wholesome 
Nov 24 2023,positive,cute movie with fun songs dont let tiktok garbage turn you away from a good family film you can still enjoy watching with family
Nov 24 2023,negative,not bad but it lacks brilliance and originality
Nov 24 2023,positive,i am a huge disney fan and this movie hit every note for me the start was a little slow and hard to follow the story line at first but once it got going it was really good great music likeable characters and lots of disney easter eggs throughout
Nov 24 2023,positive,ignore the critics this is a fun family movie reminiscent of the classics and the easter eggs are a fun touch the songs are fantastic and will be in my head for the foreseeable future and im fine with that plenty of laughs and also tears but not sad tears more like nostalgia mixed with emotion if that makes any sense
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie was one of the most absurdly loathsome pieces of film production i have ever witnessed it felt like the plot was vomited out of chatgpt and the budget was 20 bucks whoever did the animations should go back to school and the dialogue made my ears bleed disney needs to bring back its old flare before it goes up in flames
Nov 24 2023,positive,a lot of homage to the classics
Nov 24 2023,positive,this was honestly so much fun the blended art style of 2d and 3d was beautiful and a lovely homage to both disneys past and present animating styles i personally loved the songs especially what we know now this is the thanks i get and this wish which i found catchy and fun to sing hands down the best character is king magnifico hes fantastic love that disney went back to its roots of villains and villain songs and the message is a gorgeous twist on the usual wishing on a stari was so happy when i realized the direction the movie was going in my only serious drawback is that it should have been longer normally concise storytelling is great but here it felt like it all moved a little too fast and didnt give the characters time to breathe id love to have learned more about asha and her dad or magnificos background or even amayas theres so much they could have done even tiny tweaks to have made it really pack a punch  as is though its honestly pretty darn great and a ton of fun to watch especially once i realized all the little callbacks and references sprinkled throughout im definitely going to be rewatching this just to find them all
Nov 24 2023,positive,this is another amazing and magical disney film great story great songsmusic and it was so cool looking out for disney references easter eggs
Nov 24 2023,negative,im being nice by not writing a full explanation on why i dont like this movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,its not one of disneys best animated musicals  frozen and encanto were both better  but its good enough to be nice to watch its cute and sweet and hits its target but its a very straightforward fairy tale with no surprises disney has been capable of much better but it still gets a passing grade from me
Nov 24 2023,positive,great movie and very wholesome movie critics got it wrong again but the movie was made for the audience not the critics i would recommend watching it i even bought the star popcorn bucket as a souvenir 
Nov 24 2023,negative,the only interesting thing about this movie was the villain  whoever wrote the music has no idea what makes a musical one spot that i cant stop thinking about is im a star look out world here i are  it made me cringe so hard i wanted to fold in on myself  the animation feels so disjointed against the backgrounds and the story had potential that was squandered in favor of random references to other disney properties
Nov 24 2023,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,boring and unimaginative  another disappointment from disney  so sad
Nov 24 2023,negative,so bad the storyline doesnt make sense the animation is laughable and the dialogue is like it was written by chatgpt  just off waste of time and money and so disappointing especially from disney
Nov 24 2023,positive,this was well loved by our whole family beautiful animation most songs were great and the storyline captivating
Nov 24 2023,positive,i wasnt particularly impressed with the animation the soundtrack was good and the storyline was great
Nov 24 2023,negative,the worst disney movie i have ever seen  forgettable music terrible pacing derivative characters the entire family all felt like this wasnt a disney movie at all it lacked the song quality and disney magic found in their timeless animated movies it really feels like disney has lost their way if this is the new direction they want to go sorry we wont be going with you
Nov 24 2023,negative,again completely missing the mark again
Nov 24 2023,negative,i wish i could get my money back     the music is mundane with no melodic prowess    nothing was interesting or catchy  we kept turning to one another mouthing not another song  the characters were mostly empty and forgettable  it was like the management felt that a more seasoned production crew directors screenwriters and editors were too old fashioned and it was time to give deihired 20somethings their time to shine  we thought we were watching a disney channel movie   there was no shine not even with their star character
Nov 24 2023,negative,awful songs weird watercolor filter over the tired disney style
Nov 24 2023,negative,the songs were pretty bad and it felt like a remake of what most movies are
Nov 24 2023,positive,good lesson for kids great songs in the movie easy to understand
Nov 24 2023,positive,i loved the movie and the easter eggs of all the disney movies were amazing
Nov 24 2023,positive,this was a pretty good disney movie i liked the story but the music was just ok i didnt really connect with it and i felt like i tried a little too hard to be funny i didnt think it was that funny but it wasnt terrible either a good movie to see with the family 
Nov 24 2023,neutral,instead of feeling like a tribute to 100 years of disney wish feels like its desperately trying to keep up with the progressively evolving animation scene without the mouse
Nov 24 2023,negative,worst disney movie in history complete trash
Nov 24 2023,positive,it doesnt have the strongest story but wish is beautiful to be hold this movie is so beautiful with lovely music and adorable fantasy creatures it warms the heart in a time in our human history that often seems unendingly dark
Nov 24 2023,positive,back to the basics great movie great animation and great story an ode to the classics
Nov 24 2023,negative,communist garbage not worth it
Nov 24 2023,positive,best disney movie in a long time 
Nov 24 2023,positive,grandchildren who are nine and five loved that movie i also enjoyed it thoroughly
Nov 24 2023,positive,cute movie with good story line
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish was an amazing movie so entertaining took my mom and two of my kids to see it we loved it
Nov 24 2023,positive,amazing movie disney did it again i love it
Nov 24 2023,positive,really enjoyed wish my daughter loves asha we had an amazing time
Nov 24 2023,positive,loved the movie the songs and the references is a great movie to celebrate the 100th anniversary of disney
Nov 24 2023,negative,very disappointing when compared to the history of disney princess movies  the characters were never fully developed  other than one song the music was uninspiring although the singing voices were excellent the attempts at humor fell flat and the easter eggs were much too blatant
Nov 24 2023,positive,my family loved it the songs are fantastic and my wife and i loved all the easter eggs and throwbacks to the classics     sad to see so many critic reviews because knowing what i know now this movie is worth seeing in theaters and one we can watch again many times still singing the songs in my head as in leave this review
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was okay cute but the story was lacking and the songs felt forced the number of references and cameos they put in got distracting after a while
Nov 24 2023,positive,they set up the villain to have a lot of depth but failed to follow it up overall it is a pleasant movie to watch with the family
Nov 24 2023,positive,wonderful movie worth a watch
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movie is so good i honestly would pay to see it again in theaters i read a review that said it was the worst movie theyve ever seen and i think thats a bit dramatic its such a beautiful movie
Nov 24 2023,neutral,a very average movie not good or bad my kids were happy 3 5 7 years old    the villain and the plot are pretty good the music is forgettable the art is ugly and apart from the heroine and villain all the characters are annoying why isnt lin manuel miranda making more disney songs like moana and encanto
Nov 24 2023,negative,so sad disney has lost the plot and the magic
Nov 24 2023,positive,disney wish is one of most best animated film of the years
Nov 24 2023,positive,a lot of heart and a wonderful movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,as much as i love disney movies id skip this one or wait until its out on disney  beautiful but i dont appreciate the messages it gave off kids 6  8 were restless bored then in tears towards the end they didnt really understand the full message and rated it as an ok movie to watch they wished we watched trolls instead
Nov 24 2023,negative,absolutely the worst animated disney movie ive ever seen and its not even close     i wasnt expecting much after the critical panning but its even worse than that     especially the music and the animation and the writing its just all bad i suppose on the positive side its equally terrible in every facet so at least its consistently awful
Nov 24 2023,positive,disney has redeemed themselves finally a disney film with a great plot fresh characters and a new and pleasing animation style a must see
Nov 24 2023,positive,a movie that shows how precious our dreams are thanks disney for this wonderful and moving theatrical experience
Nov 24 2023,positive,im not one to decide based on critics ratings if i want to see a movie or not and this is even more true for wish do they live in a parallel reality where they watched a different movie wish is  wonderful and fun for all ages the animation style truly shines on the big screen not sure what happened with the trailers posted on social media but they dont do it true justice you feel like you are in a fairytale book asha is a wonderful addition to the princess lineup magnifico is deliciously evil and the star truly steals the show
Nov 24 2023,positive,i loved this movie i loved how they went full throttle on a pure disney villain the music was super catchy and the visuals were incredible it felt like watching a moving storybook i cant wait to see it again
Nov 24 2023,positive,ive grown up watching disney movies with my family there have been so many great ones over the years but wish truly captured the magic and innocence that is disneys core the movies characters setting and story emanate the same feelings one gets when walking through disneyland for the first time or seeing a montage of our favorite characters it is an incredible feelgood film to celebrate 100 years of disney the message is magical and its impossible to resist smiling throughout the entire 95 minutes
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was beautiful and so were the songs
Nov 24 2023,negative,for the first time in my life i have to give disney 1 star     this movie although visually stunning is poor story wise there are tons of disney easter eggs in the movie but that alone does not a movie make     while i loved how it began with a beautiful book like in the old disney movies but after the first song welcome to rosas the movie went downhill fast     i cant believe i am saying this but the lessons in this movie are not childfriendly at all not unless you want to teach your child how to be a karen and that stealing is all right as long as you believe that someone else stole it first by the way the people gave their wishes willingly to magnifico for rentfree and taxfree stay in rosas     plus we dont get much character development on asha how did her father die who attacked magnificos childhood kingdom and why does it haunt him so much     also how on earth did queen amaya find asha and friends when they were supposedly in hiding lol she just showed up near the end of their rebellion song to join them     and really putting we are all shareholders in the lyrics of a song     oh dear disney please wake up and employ better directors and scriptwriters    thoroughly disappointed
Nov 23 2023,positive,it reminds me the magic that disney had over this 100 years of their creation music magic valuable lessons and faith really brings back the magic of the fairy tales
Nov 23 2023,positive,it has some issues and a song that is just bad but overall is a good movie love the disney references and the villain is pretty good
Nov 23 2023,positive,the perfect 100 years of disney movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,yall are gonna cry yall are gonna cry so hard the songs are amazing
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie has something for everyone  young and old alike will adore this fable that is actually a precursor to all disney movies before it  it is absolutely perfect for the 100th anniversary of disney  the songs were catchy yet poignant   the story was adventurous  yet touching with a strong moral  this is a true family film that attaches itself to the core of each and everyone of us this film had all the trimmings and magic of the films we have come to expect and love from disney
Nov 23 2023,negative,the film was much darker than the synopsis and movie trailer i love movies with social commentary but this might be a bit of a reach for toddlers
Nov 23 2023,negative,took the kids to see a disney movie for thanksgiving this is easily the worst disney movie i have ever seen the kids will sit through the entirety of encanto and will ask us to pause it so they can go to the bathroom we almost had to leave the theatre the kids were acting up because they were so bored
Nov 23 2023,neutral,saw it with our 4 year old today  wasnt terrible wasnt amazing either just meh in that it was a good way to kill time    story just didnt feel very engaging something about either the writing or the pacing didnt allow you to really feel like a story or adventure my 4 year old wasnt very entertained song were waaaay to off and frankly we couldnt remember a single one afters we also felt the turn on the bad guy was odd and rushed also the fact that everyone instantly gave up on him after he was good to everyone was a sad sub story line     easter eggs were fun animation was great there was a few good laughs mushrooms and chickens but few and far between maybe a rewatch will change our minds
Nov 23 2023,positive,very enjoyable and music was excellent
Nov 23 2023,negative,wish is to diney movies as lacroix is to flavor imagine what a generic diney movie is thats this entire movie its so generic store brand cereal is looking to file for copyright infringement
Nov 23 2023,positive,people who want to hate on this movie just already hate disney and thats where its coming from the movie is actually very good
Nov 23 2023,positive,solid movie  kids liked it  def better than lightyear or strange world   good family movie for the holidays
Nov 23 2023,positive,this was a great movie disney released since encanto and i really enjoyed it but the villain song was one disappointment
Nov 23 2023,positive,despite the degrading plot which gets a little lost as the script progresses it is still an instant classic described by some of my colleagues the only points of negativity highlighted its running time which hinders the construction of certain arcs of the feature and some secondary characters that could have had more depth as well as the protagonist who is still a good characterbut overall its a beautiful animation that achieved due to variables r short moments a promise to celebrate the companys 100th anniversaryand i wish if other colleagues who attack the film were a little patient in relation to the message and the context of the film i give it an 80 and an a for the film that for me and the majority the majority will have fun with the film
Nov 23 2023,positive,absolutely love this movie
Nov 23 2023,negative,bad storytelling annoying characters stupid logic
Nov 23 2023,positive,the music was great
Nov 23 2023,positive,love the story another great animation from disney had a wonderful time with the family watching it
Nov 23 2023,positive,disney finally going back to the fairytales we love a huge step in the right direction for the company
Nov 23 2023,negative,i was disappointed it had a thin plot line that might have been written by ai and too many intrusive overwrought power ballads with unmemorable melodies and rapid fire lyrics that interrupted the flow of the film
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie was awesome colorful vibrant and relaxing i absolutely believe this can be a smash for disney the last part made me tear and the easter eggs are there and made me like the movie even more you must watch this
Nov 23 2023,positive,was a great movie loved the twist of the king being a good person and letting his fear turn him into a villan
Nov 23 2023,positive,okay but not enough laughs or comic relief
Nov 23 2023,negative,least favorite holiday release in awhile
Nov 23 2023,positive,meh  not memorable  situation feels forced  story seems to be everyone with good intentions is doomed to grow into the villain in the end  rinse and repeat
Nov 23 2023,positive,my daughter and i loved it
Nov 23 2023,positive,amazing had that disney nostalgia feel to it i loved it and my kids loved it an instant classic
Nov 23 2023,positive,loved this wholesome family movie  great story telling that is entertaining and clean for the whole family loved the story the songs and characters
Nov 23 2023,positive,gorgeous animation and lovely music my kids are already begging to see it again
Nov 23 2023,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever watched do not listen to disneys bot reviews
Nov 23 2023,negative,it was okay i wasnt a fan of how the king was written though he could have been interesting but they turned him into a generic chaotic villain character every about the movie was pretty generic honestly its a fine movie for the family though like if youre a family of 4 and you just want to take your kids to see a fun disney movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,an inspiring story telling with a touching underscore of the power the precious and the freedom of wishes
Nov 23 2023,negative,it was a little bland in most parts and a little too intense for my grandkids  4and 6 i expect more from disney not very original
Nov 23 2023,positive,all 100 years of disney included in this movie the best wish from disney to everyone
Nov 23 2023,positive,this film is highly underrated for a disney film i am not sure why the critics decided to bash it but the film is great  it pays a lot of nice homages to disneys other films and the studios 100 year history it also has many memorable songs including at all costs and the main song this wish  magnifico is actually a villain that is more fleshed out than others in recent years due to some tragic backstory somewhat understandable motivation and his bombastic behavior  star is also a very adorable character for the film dont let the critics discourage you from seeing this film
Nov 23 2023,negative,aside from the villain wish is pretty much generic and forgettable and not only looks like a disney jr show it is a disney jr show and not in the good way  for celebrating their 100 year anniversary the film gives a really damaging lesson to the audience about wishes with a villain that feels more like a hero than the main protagonist
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie makes you think
Nov 23 2023,positive,worth every penny the plot has something for everyone to enjoy and the sheer amount of references to other disney properties was wonderful a celebration of 100 years of disney
Nov 23 2023,positive,i loved wish it is funny touching and inspiring
Nov 23 2023,positive,i loved it i laughed a lot the star was adorable chris pine was wonderfully evil the special moment after the credits are finished made me cry animation was beautiful i dont understand the critics on this one i really dont
Nov 23 2023,positive,beautifully animated and wonderful story i only wish the studio would have gone full 2d as they considered doing 
Nov 23 2023,positive,amazing movie by no means perfect but the ending had me in tears loved the plot i wish they had used the other songs as in the ads instead people might not have started a hate train if the better songs were shown
Nov 23 2023,positive,greta movie sucks have all these bias critic reviews trying to bring it down
Nov 23 2023,positive,disney wish is the best amazing and awesome movie i ever see my whole entire of my life this movie needs 100 rotten tomatoes
Nov 23 2023,negative,the movie has none of the disney magic so many movies managed to do prior its a shame this is the companys 100th movie and it being such a bore
Nov 23 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie this is exactly what i was hoping for from disney chris pine was golden and ariana was incredible i got chills watching this and the songs were incredible
Nov 23 2023,positive,what are the negative reviews all about so it is commercial what isnt just watch the macys thanksgiving parade  the new drawing style in wish is utterly gorgeous the heroine has a nose not a sky nose a la anna in frozen the rendition in general reminds me of winnie the poo illustrations so it shows heroines of disneys past lovely and apropos and for once the queen is not evil   not a movie full of slapstick for the younger crowd thats true and we can see this is being turned into a broadway musical but please make a couple of good songs what we have now is so forgettable that is embarrassing they got paid for it remember coming out of a movie humming be our guest no show stopper here maybe the drum rendition so you try to karaoke that one  go and see this if youve loved disney and its magic it is an enjoyable time at the movies
Nov 23 2023,positive,best disney film in years this is going to spread like wildfire timely and poignant family left the theatre happy
Nov 23 2023,negative,such a boring movie characters werent lovable it wasnt enchanting the songs werent very good the plot was bland and it seemed they just rushed to put any movie out it completely missed the mark for a disney film people in the theater werent even laughing at the parts supposed to be funny plus the villain was really dark and scary for a little kid my son and i were happy when the film was over i would wait to stream this and not pay the movie theater prices
Nov 23 2023,negative,this movie was horrible
Nov 23 2023,positive,perfect i liked it
Nov 23 2023,positive,such a lovely picture
Nov 23 2023,negative,most depressing animated disney movie ever  everyone should not get their wish  bad president
Nov 23 2023,positive,wish feels like a throwback to classic disney that may divide or appeal to fans young or old nonetheless its effortless charm and beauty drive this touching ode to the animation studios
Nov 23 2023,negative,mediocre songs mediocre storyline if this was any other studio i would have said this movie was okay but i grew up expecting filet and they keep serving up frozen microwaved chicken nuggets    my wish is that disney figures out how to do better
Nov 23 2023,positive,the best movie of 2023 and one of disneys best in years
Nov 23 2023,positive,lovely romantic picturesque
Nov 23 2023,positive,wish is an instant classic i saw it with my family at the theater  my family and the audience were laughing and enjoying the movie chris pine nailed the villain magnifico and asha was an adorable hero the star character was genius the music stood out to me the songs and scenes were fresh but resonated of classic disney films the story line was a classic formula good vs evil but with an authentic inspirational modern twist i loved it and everyone in the theater seemed to agree with their applaud
Nov 23 2023,positive,critics often overthink movies like this  you can tell by the audience score that the movie is less about technical perfection and more about the underlying message about one of the most important aspects of life    my son and daughter saw it with me 10 and 7 years coming out of it my son honestly turned to me and talked about the importance of working hard for what you wish for in life  that alone makes the movie a winner
Nov 23 2023,positive,amazing movie best disney film since frozen
Nov 23 2023,positive,roy attempts to reset the natural order of things lorraine becomes increasingly suspicious
Nov 23 2023,negative,kids seemed to enjoy but could not come up with a favorite part other than what was in the trailer not really rewatchable as compared to their other movies it also felt like the whole movie was trying to respond to all the adversity going on with disney right now other than just trying to follow a coherent plot
Nov 23 2023,positive,esse filme é show 
Nov 23 2023,positive,very good before
Nov 23 2023,positive,eu amo a disney e amei o trailer de wish
Nov 23 2023,positive,adorable story this movie is very nice
Nov 23 2023,positive,i found it super interesting
Nov 23 2023,positive,my grandkids and i loved this movie it has great music and humor cant wait to see it again
Nov 23 2023,positive,wow the critics really missed the mark on this one  this movie was fantastic  my wife and i enjoyed it very much  my 4 year old loved it and has been singing the soundtrack since we have seen it  the songs are very good especially this wish   ignore the critics like we did and judge it for yourself also stay for a sweet gesture at the end of the credits
Nov 23 2023,positive,i love the disneys movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,i wanna go see the movie cause its a must see no matter what
Nov 23 2023,positive,i think the critics got it all wrong this movie is a seismic shift from all other full length animation movies in the past one line of the movie says it all for me the revolution is coming
Nov 23 2023,negative,seen the film its painful flat characters 3d models used over and over again the villain is not a real villain trying in every way to sell him as such the fact that it is supposed to be a kind of prequel to some disney films is even worse worst disney film ever a disgrace that it was released to celebrate 100 years disney just doesnt seem to want to straighten itself out
Nov 23 2023,positive,nice movie and worth to watch
Nov 23 2023,negative,the songs are halfway decent but the plotis this supposed to commemorate 100 years of disney  it shows that they lost the magic of creativity  you have to see it with your brain off
Nov 23 2023,negative,this movie didnt feel like disney it was boring plain and simple my kid wanted to leave midway through the movie the story is a convoluted mess if this is what disney is wanting to do with their new storiescharacters then theyre in trouble 
Nov 23 2023,positive,maestro hits all the right notes with stunning finesse
Nov 23 2023,positive,this film is very funny and fun i recommend it to all children
Nov 23 2023,positive,fun for the family enjoyed the music and pacing we will watch again
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie i loved it
Nov 23 2023,positive,good movie wonderfull graphics
Nov 23 2023,positive,it has been 100 fantastic years of disney and this movie is a grand celebration of that from the many callback moments from past disney movies to the magic that makes a disney movie a disney movies wish feels like a classic already very reminiscent of the disney renaissance era thankful i watched this in 3d and suggest others do the same i will be buying wish on 4k uhd bluray
Nov 23 2023,positive,the music was fabulous
Nov 23 2023,positive,this starts off really good somehow loses some of its magic half way in but then makes a turn and gets your attention another great disney film
Nov 23 2023,negative,just fucking terrible this just isnt disney quailty
Nov 23 2023,negative,a weak and unlikable character in a story that seems tiresome and unoriginal
Nov 23 2023,positive,it was ok it was entertaining and i know theres a profound message there but somehow it didnt all come together for me
Nov 23 2023,neutral,wish has some enjoyable elements but it never quite lives up to the potential of its premise and just becomes a generic animated fairytale thats too derivative of other disney films
Nov 23 2023,negative,disney should be ashamed of putting this out as their 100th anniversary film its so hollow and empty with the worst songs ive heard come from a disney film these movies used to be special this feels like a joke this is the movie someone would make if they were doing a parody of disney and not like in a shrek way
Nov 23 2023,positive,so beautiful and lovely not all of the songs land but some of them do spectacularly highly reccomend to all families and dreamers 
Nov 23 2023,negative,the plot was too predictable it just didnt make much sense and the villain wasnt much of a villain but mostly egotistical guy the worst stuff ive ever seen from disney
Nov 23 2023,negative,really really just an uninspired bland and frankly dull movie being the 100th anniversarys movie of the most renowned animation studio in the world you would expect a movie that neatly ties all of that history together however what we get is an embodiment of where bob iger has taken this studio this movie is a colorful mess with simply annoying characters jokes that i can only imagine appeal to 3 year olds and nobody else the my butt found it joke in particular and songs that try so hard to emulate the style of lin manuel maranda but miss the mark entirely king magnifico while an attempt to make a real villain shows how disney has lost its edge in the writing department asha is just another adorkable protagonist who seems to be written by someone who wanted to copy moana or mirabel but has never seen moana or encanto overall a terrible movie that attempts to show how far disney has come but ends up showing how far disney has fallen from grace
Nov 23 2023,negative,basically like a disney fanfic not well thought out not well produced characters were flat and uninspired the animation gave major 2000 barbie vibes on everyone but the main character
Nov 23 2023,positive,finally best disney film ive seen since frozen dont believe the critics disney goes back to its root and its core of good positive messaging inspirational heartfelt and wholesome
Nov 23 2023,negative,in the past my family and i used to enjoy every single disney movie starting from the fantastic little mermaid with its score and lively characters it made my family want to watch each and every single disney movie that they made and all of them provided whimsical feelings and wonderous worlds for us to be immersed in today with wish i dont get anything at all with it sorry disney i will be one of those who will not give you marvels or star wars anymore hope
Nov 23 2023,positive,its a beautiful movie with a clean vibe even the villain is not so evil a great story for everyone it really took me back to classical disney
Nov 23 2023,positive,very entertaining movie great for kids and adults
Nov 23 2023,positive,not your standard disney princess movie good fun and loved all the classic disney easter eggs throughout the film great villain and loved all the songs ive been listening to the soundtrack on repeat since kids will love it
Nov 23 2023,negative,there is no story and character development i wasted two hours for just random singing
Nov 23 2023,negative,the whole movie is trying to remind you of when disney used to know how to make movies like this but failing to actively make a good one like you know 
Nov 23 2023,positive,went to see it tonight and it was such a cute movie my whole family loved it
Nov 23 2023,negative,very very bad story even without the forced commercial it looks like the story and villain feels out of place gone are the days of villains being a menace to the characters the animation is offputting on many instances and honestly not even the talking goat was able to save the movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,average storytelling and animation but the soundtrack easter eggs and comedic relief were great
Nov 23 2023,negative,disney sure has had a rough few years if youre going to do a fairy godmother origin story dont wait until the last minute for the reveal  the king became evil because it was necessary for a thin plot to progress but its an allegory for growing up and forgetting your dreams i guess bad songs too just hire lin manuel permanently
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie is beautiful  its a show of love and appreciation to animation and cultural representation from disney it might havent been a complex story but the music and dances inspired in flamenco and the architectural and clothing representation of alandalus is simply gorgeous
Nov 23 2023,negative,its was a mid movie bland and boring it was trying too hard to ride off of emotional moments and nostalgia and ended up being empty and hollow
Nov 23 2023,positive,love love love this movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,everything about the movie was amazing critics need to reconsider their livelihoods as this film should be a fresh tomato the easter eggs makes it amazing great to watch good laughs willing to see it multiple times must watch
Nov 23 2023,positive,dont listen to the negativity and see this movie this is a wonderful story about standing up for what you believe in even if it means risking safety and comfort
Nov 23 2023,negative,the story was weak  the music was bad  the ending was dumb  not worth the time or money
Nov 23 2023,positive,wish is a beautifully animated movie most of the time that has a compelling modern fairy tale storyline reminiscent of great disney movies of the past  its use of the song this wish by main character asha and the people to break king magnificos spell at the climax of the movie was stunning it had great characters and a fascinating story of kidnapped wishes were stolen by an evil king  there were too many songs during the first half of the movie and not all the dialogue was well written but the main story visuals and main songs made up for other deficiencies
Nov 23 2023,negative,sad just sad another flop 
Nov 23 2023,positive,just saw disneys wish i was highly optimistic for this movie with whats been happening with the disney company in recent years this movie gave me hope for the future this movie is a love letter to 100 years of disney storytelling    ariana debose aka the bullet was incredible as asha shes a love letter to those who always wish on stars to make their dreams come true     chris pine was really great as king magnifico king magnifico is your classic disney villain you like to hate    the story is so simple in the best ways it about making your wishes come true and not letting anyone tell you that you cant    i was grinning ear to ear for all the references to disney history in this movie     the soundtrack is so incredible benjamin rice and julia michaels did such an amazing job with the music this wish is now one of my new favorites disney songs    the visuals were so incredible it took me back to the days of 2d animation with 3d animation to complement it this is makes me really wish for the disney company to go back to 2d animated movies and telling original stories this is a huge risk to take and it was worth doing    this runtime is 90 minutes and no minute is wasted     overall disneys wish is a return to form for disney animation if you love classic disney story telling disney musical numbers and animation youll love this movie big thanks to disney for making movies and congratulations to 100 years of storytelling    1010 highly recommend
Nov 23 2023,negative,wish wholly failed to achieve what it set out to do excessive callouts and an unoriginal plot combined with uncanny animations awkward character lines and unmemorable songs made this one of disneys worst animations of the last century
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie is a wonderful amalgamation of classic animation and digital technology combined with signature catchy songs and storytelling that touches the heart an absolute love note to 100 years of disney animation must see
Nov 23 2023,positive,when i went to see it i thought it was normal but it was successful on its 100th anniversary and nothing progressed good plot and good references to old movies and kingdom hearts of course i loved this movie it deserves to be watched again and king waooo is very bad like xeanorth who wants hearts to be powerful just as wish has the excellent concept of kingdom hearts
Nov 23 2023,positive,wish captured everything about disney and its magic  i loved all the nostalgia and music i especially love the iconic disney opening with a simple book
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie was a good feeling movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,super cute movie my 5 year old loved it she said it was the best movie ever for those of us that remember the classics cinderella sleeping beauty snow white there are lots of call backs throughout the movie that makes it nostalgic to watch
Nov 23 2023,positive,this is a disney movie at heart and that is exactly what is shown throughout the movie they go back to their origins with many references to their past which is why this movie perfectly represents the 100 year past of a company that has inspired generations the critics are hypocrites who are hating on the company rather than the film itself the past few movies strange world have not been up to par and the critics have been saying that they should go back to the old formula and when they do they say that it is a step back and to simple this movie tells a beautiful story in a short amount of time and while the 1h 30min seemed short it was the perfect amount of time as a disney fan this is all i could ask for and anyone who grew up with any generation of disney movies should watch this as it will take you back to your childhood
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie is perfect and does exactly what the studio said it would it celebrates the past 100 years while also modernizing into the future the music is catchy the characters are likable and kids leave the theatre extremely happy
Nov 23 2023,negative,in every aspect this movie has failed at least in every disney aspect the music terrible the villain slightly fun but ultimately one note the main character is the overused im so quirky character most disney movies have used which is getting stale at this point the past few years with the exception of elementals which i personally enjoyed have shown that disney is losing its magic although it was nice to have a real disney villain again he loses all meaning with already having power and is evil for evils sake even the magic shown in the movie was a letdown a few talking animals and trees arent very imaginative disney has truly fallen off the saddle whether or not it can get back on has remained to be seen sorry fellas nostalgia wasnt enough to save this one
Nov 23 2023,negative,boring and unoriginal just predictable and been done so many time same plot i am disappointed  in disney
Nov 23 2023,positive,i love the movie and the songs
Nov 23 2023,positive,wish was the best disney i have seen in years my grandkids absolutely loved it
Nov 23 2023,positive,while it certainly wasnt perfect this was an adorable feel good film with many unexpected and mostly welldone nods to the history of disney filmmaking
Nov 23 2023,positive,i really really enjoyed it a few of the songs are very hit or miss especially in my family but we adored the story and thought the villain was excellent despite how his song portrays him all the references are amazing too
Nov 23 2023,negative,awful this was disneys biggest swing and worst miss in a long time you couldnt pay me to watch it again so cheesy so terrible
Nov 23 2023,positive,was a very cute movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie brings a mix of nostalgia to an important aspect of life so often we give up our wishes and dreams without realizing the cost we pay with great songs and a terrific cast this movie does exactly what it should and moves where we often forget we need it most
Nov 23 2023,negative,disney animation has lost their way 
Nov 23 2023,positive,so heartfelt and warming it shows glimpses of other disney spot and brings a new meaning to making a wish
Nov 23 2023,positive,honestly i loved it lovely to see an actual villain after a long time the music the characters all great funny too 
Nov 23 2023,positive,loved this movie its so disney just love the energy and the display of magic and hope
Nov 23 2023,positive,i enjoyed it if your going for some disney fun you will enjoy it
Nov 23 2023,positive,loved the references to all the classic movies the family had fun pointing out each one they saw and the content was wonderful for the entire family
Nov 23 2023,positive,i loved it the music was great the backgrounds were beautiful and i enjoyed the nods to other disney films
Nov 23 2023,positive,as someone growing up in the 90s it felt very nostalgic with a modern feel my daughters and i loved it
Nov 23 2023,negative,i honestly thought this is the worst disney movie made in the last 20 years music was sub par and the story line and message were blah i was board at the movie my 5 year old daughter didnt love it usually she wants to see it again and asked to see trolls 
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie is great in 2d but the 3d adds just enough to it to make it even better
Nov 23 2023,positive,while this movie is a veritable celebration of the beautiful stories and characters disney animation has gifted us in the last 100 years that wasnt why i loved it i loved it for the journey it takes the audience on i found it deeply relatable and moving my fellow audience members clapped and cheered together in these dark and challenging times i needed to see loveable chacters triumph i want to be reminded that we all can too
Nov 23 2023,positive,so great  loved the goat and all the songs were amazing  classic disney animation at its best
Nov 23 2023,positive,absolutely loved it
Nov 23 2023,positive,excellent family movie took the grandkids ages 410 and they all loved it
Nov 23 2023,positive,100 years of amazing storytelling all rolled up into one asha is an amazing protagonist and magnifico is an amazing villain
Nov 23 2023,positive,loved the movie so much every moment every song king magnifico was great and asha star valentino and their friends were written perfectly the plot was so good all the easter eggs like bambi and peter pan like crazy and the credits  end credits almost made me cry so beautiful great job disney
Nov 23 2023,positive,story and songs were okay the whole thing just felt a little bland
Nov 23 2023,positive,while not the instant hit that moana or frozen were i think this is a beautifully made film with solid songs a great heart a fantastic new cahracter in star that kids will love  i would put it there with something like pocahontas or mulan a well made film with one or two songs that you will remember out of the theater but not a classic for the ages like dumbo or peter pan  its a solid film that i think kids  families will enjoy technically brilliant with characters that arent as well developed as they could be  the villain in the story was memorable  the thrust of the story a little nebulous but expertly done  i think people are just giving out a little too much disneyhate of late
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie was amazing it feels like a true thanks to disney fans and it was almost perfect there were a few flaws but nonetheless this movie was outstanding in a critic standpoint were this movie is a hit or miss you really need to be a disney fan and understand the true meaning of this movie being a love letter to the fans while also being a movie with tons of references and easter eggs to classic disney movies this is a must see
Nov 23 2023,positive,its was animation and color person a lead singer
Nov 23 2023,positive,the backgrounds look great the actors did good the songs are catchy and memorable a good disney movie the only thing that could be better is that the story doesnt really have a message films like moana frozen the lion king had important lessons for kids and adults this film is mainly for kids
Nov 23 2023,positive,colorful happy great songs disney
Nov 23 2023,positive,great graphics it seemed like they tried to include old school drawn backgrounds with 3d characters music as usual on point
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie connects so much disney magic in 90 mins couldnt ask for better
Nov 22 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one they have absolutely garbage takes on this wish is a charming movie that is a love letter to disney animation
Nov 22 2023,negative,what movie was to evelyn too scary for children my granddaughter wanted to leave within a few minutes shes six years old
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie is very original and simple few of the songs are iconic and star was too adorable magnifico is an amazing villain and asha is now one of my favorites the critics are so delusional and are bashing this movie too hard strange world is probably the worst disney movie i seen of all time because it was typical family drama and super boring and bland i hope wish does well at the box office because its very good and i love the movie im so getting wish on blu ray and digital
Nov 22 2023,positive,the movie wasnt bad but it wasnt good either  i dont know what i expecting but this was disappointing the plot was boring i lost interest in the movie and so did my kids

Nov 22 2023,positive,really good movie with a nice soundtrack
Nov 22 2023,positive,delightful fun and uplifting great music
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is an old fashioned disney movie  and thats exactly what we need it almost bucks the trend by not trying too hard like a lot of disneys movies recently this was not a film for critics but for the audience and my young daughters and we were thoroughly entertained i loved watching the look on my daughters face during the singing of this wish this was a great family film and will be rewatched in my house many times to come
Nov 22 2023,negative,wish is by far the blandest disney movie i have ever seen its halfbaked unambitious and has no creative central theme to leave you thinking about
Nov 22 2023,positive,the latest disney classic is here as you can see theres a lot of references to other classics and it has that disney magic so i think is a great movie to celebrate 100 years of disney and of course theres some people that dont like it because you know they say oooh its wooke just ignore that people but yeah the animation is so beautiful 2d animation with 3d animation is a good combination
Nov 22 2023,positive,i mean i actually thought it was one of the better recent disney movies nothing surprising or groundbreaking but the kids loved it so yeah
Nov 22 2023,positive,while its definitely an entertaining and rewarding watch for longtime fans of disney like myself it doesnt have much appeal outside of that
Nov 22 2023,positive,great music no dull moments for me and i love how they put in the classics in the the movie
Nov 22 2023,negative,i cant believe this is disney  there was so much flat voice acting in this film other than chris pine all the other voice actors sounded like it was a commercial  as usual politics and agenda injection  not enough fun  aome od the songs was okay  but other than chris pines character everyone else is completely forgetable the main character is most forgettable and her friends are pretty much useless in his film wait for d for this one
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was a cute movie and the singing was fantastic my grandson and i enjoyed it
Nov 22 2023,positive,solid movie good songs and a nice message about dreamswishes being both a frustrating burden and an enormous source of hope and motivation trolls was overall more upbeat fun visually stunning and easier to pay attention to
Nov 22 2023,positive,good heartfelt story with no apparent divisive politically correct narratives additionally references to classic disney stories was a nice touch i especially liked that the story said we are all stars and that we are all connected as all humanity should be
Nov 22 2023,negative,i too have a wishto have 2 hours of my life back   a wishcom version of a disney movie seems as if disney is creating fluff to fill in for the lack of quality movies now and days
Nov 22 2023,positive,so beautiful loved the music the action the message the visual display was breathtaking well done disney
Nov 22 2023,positive,i truly dont get the hate for this movie its cute a simple good vs evil story great characters and humor and an awesome soundtrack
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved it disney universe origin story
Nov 22 2023,positive,a beautiful and loving tribute to disneys 100th anniversary thatwhile it couldve been a weebit longer and bit more developed in the worldbuilding departmentbrings the sights of its stunning storybooklike animation and the sounds of its truly catchy and memorable songs and very talents of its remarkable voice cast particularly ariana debose and chris pine all together in one nearperfect package wish is truly an experience 100 years in the making that needs to be seen to be believed
Nov 22 2023,positive,great movie one of the best disney movies ever created both of my kids loved it and are now singing the songs endlessly kids were happy to see the diversity in the various characters the villain was not necessarily evil but had some pride and an ego that built up over time from his many good deeds and as a result from his personal trauma overall message is even when you overcome obstacles and rise up the power ranks stay humble
Nov 22 2023,negative,it was like if disney had a checklist of things that need to come back from older movies so um yeah princess like person check talking animal companion check and side characters that just appear check its just like that
Nov 22 2023,positive,dont understand why the critics are being so harsh on this movie it is a fun time entertaining with great music i had no complaints leaving the theater sometimes its best just to tune out the noise and go have fun you wont be disappointed
Nov 22 2023,positive,it is a good movie for young children
Nov 22 2023,positive,i absolutely disagree with the rotten tomatoes critics this movie is absolutely amazing and all critics are totally wrong disney deserve more than this im 100 support this movie no matter what this movie wins over me as a long time disney fans from soundtrack artistry the actors everything above are very awesome despite that im calling out everyone for those who who raising kids to watch this movie 100 years has it once i hate how present world are full of pessimistic people and how society treat people terrible today are these days this movie is an e ticket all the way back to childhood and its worth the money im at attempt to watch this movie for second time this time im watching in 3d
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was awesome most songs were a blast and theres some really funny bits in there the magic is really cool and a nice homage to previous disney movies theres a lot of easter eggs to hunt and i probably missed a lot too stay for the post credit scene 
Nov 22 2023,negative,it is mid not worth your time
Nov 22 2023,positive,great movie my grandchildren and i just loved it    im glad we went to see it
Nov 22 2023,negative,how did disney go from making amazing movies to this this was without a doubt the worst disney movie ive seen in quite sometime main character was good and so was the star but the rest of the film kind of sucked
Nov 22 2023,positive,im confused by the critics ratings wonderful message and the music was awesome perhaps not a movie id watch over and over but it had more depth than other disney movies and i really enjoyed it
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved it wonderful in every way
Nov 22 2023,negative,liked the animation but story was boring
Nov 22 2023,positive,it is too ambiguous lack the authenticity that of coco or encanto the villain is not a much of villain and the protagonist is much annoying and non relatable she has some friends that are not much likable for some reason asha would get an star and star has some power but not really the visuals rendered look like old video games or unprofessional watercolor which is understandable for if they wanted cut down on the budget asha hair are braided and flowing in the air its not believable and making you question why they dont have weight but the animation and vfx are very very good it make the move worth watching it on big screen
Nov 22 2023,positive,not the best ive seen  my granddaughter was a bit scared by the villan
Nov 22 2023,neutral,the movie is fun not flawless but fun 
Nov 22 2023,positive,the second song in the movie really was out of place but after that its a great story and the ending was cute a feel good movie for the whole family great action and villain
Nov 22 2023,negative,it had a good concept but was horribly executed king magnifico and amaya suffered the brunt it all in the beginning he was given a tragic backstory and valid reasons for doing certain things that he did his relationship with amaya was also portrayed so cutely and was one of the only things i loved about the movie but then halfway through they decide to throw all that away for the sake of having him be a stereotypical disney villain you cant have it both ways and its what essentially ruined it
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved the story line and the music
Nov 22 2023,positive,great story funny and great music
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved the story and the references to other disney movies
Nov 22 2023,positive,i really loved the movie and the music i had a big smile on my face the whole time people said it was generic but that was the point it was supposed to be a return to form disney movie that uses all 61 previous disney movies to create the script and the plot it wasnt supposed to break ground it was supposed to be a combination of the disney movies i think its worth seeing and forming your own opinion
Nov 22 2023,negative,i usually love most disney animated films or at least enjoy them but after watching wish yesterday i feel like this movie overall failed   its not so much that the film is badim sure most kids will enjoy itits just that it feels like someone fed every previous disney script into chat gpt and this is what it spit out  its disappointingly blah and could have been so much better 
Nov 22 2023,positive,that was the best love letter to disney ive ever seen in my life
Nov 22 2023,negative,i never thought it possible to find different ways to spell boring but there you go 100 years and the magic its just not there the pandering is through the roofs white people continue to be vilified and disney continues to be mystified as to why people just dont like their movies
Nov 22 2023,positive,finally disney is back to normal with a good movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family with no unpleasant hidden agendas just plain old wonderful disney i hope it hits 3 billion at the box office finally a good movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,serving as a love letter to fans of disney animation films wish delivered a spectacular and magical cinematic experience with its beautifully designed world incredible cast of characters and amazing songs and sound design
Nov 22 2023,positive,i have no idea why people are rating this low its amazing from a lifetime disney fan theres so much hidden to find but the best part is the music
Nov 22 2023,positive,animation was amazing songs were fun and catchy so many easter eggs loved magnifico there was a lot of nostalgia in this movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,this film was the most incredible animation by disney  so happy to see so many references this whole story was so refreshing but nostalgic and beautiful  the characters  music  visuals were all so perfect wow 1010
Nov 22 2023,positive,disneys wish enchants audiences with its stunning animation bringing to life a world rosas     the visuals take the cake showcasing disneys animation power at its peak the imersive whimsical story bring forward all the classics of disneys last 100 years with a fun and new age twist on classic stories    in this celebration of artistry and innovation disneys wish is a wish fulfilled for animation lovers and disney fans alike with its enchanting visuals and heartwarming story its a mustwatch for all ages

Nov 22 2023,positive,wish saves disney and have an extraordinary mixed animation of 2d and 3d
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is now my new favorite walt disney animation studio film it has the best disney magic ive ever seen watching wish in cinemas is the best way to celebrate 100th anniversary of walt disney animation studio every disney fan should see wish in theaters many times pretty sure the more times you see wish the more youll love it happy 100th year to walt disney studio
Nov 22 2023,negative,disneys 100th celebration falls flat with wish a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved disney animated canon    unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so poorly executed there are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme uneven pacing and boring flat characters the film attempts to pay homage to older disney classics and all the ingredients are there but instead of showing the beats like older disney films we are told the story through confusing dialogue and little action asha joins disneys recent line of uninspiring adorkable female protagonists with no defining motivations or character growth other than this bad thing happened and i must stop it the animation and sound dont fair better with bland popy music that feels like filller and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished there is no be our guest part of your world let it go or we dont talk about bruno     its laughable that one of the lyrics to the song im a star in the movie is we are all shareholders wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what the company has becomea rushed soulless by the numbers paintjob to please investors with no innovation in storytelling or animation a massive disappointment to the companys legacy
Nov 22 2023,neutral,animation was not great
Nov 22 2023,positive,i really loved that the story did not center around a love interest but asking yourself what you really want in life and what matters most the title song was really well done and the reprise gave me goosebumps alan tudyk  ariana de bose had excellent voice acting performances star is an icon and i couldnt get enough of their little moments of cuteness
Nov 22 2023,positive,liked the twist on the end  the once good king did not have a change of heart  love the story line of your dreams coming true
Nov 22 2023,positive,great animation characters and very much easter eggs i cried a lot during the movie i definitely recommend this movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,amazing movie people should go watch it and form their own opinion before they believe what these biased critics are saying
Nov 22 2023,neutral,its definitely not my favorite disney movie but my 7 year old liked it the animation was disappointing and the songs seemed forced there were not any fun upbeat songs that i usually enjoy in a disney movie i enjoyed looking for references to past disney movies but overall it was a disappointment
Nov 22 2023,negative,disney didnt even try its like they reused isabellas encanto model and exact same colour scheme stole annas quirky personality tried to copy lin manuel mirandas songs but poorly picked another animal to sell as a plush and then asked chat gpt nicely to write the entire script in fact i even asked it to write me a disney movie and everything it wrote hit the movie beat by beat then delivered it to me unrendered
Nov 22 2023,positive,absolutely loved it
Nov 22 2023,negative,i am a huge disney fan and i felt like this movie was a big whiff the story felt forced the characters felt hollow and the art looked like it was for a made for tvstreaming movie puss in boots the last wish did a much better job of using this art style i really hope that inside out 2 turns out better save yourself the time and watch pib 2 instead of this mess
Nov 22 2023,positive,a great movie with a wonderful message  we loved it
Nov 22 2023,positive,there was a lot of sorcery   i am getting more disappointed in disney
Nov 22 2023,positive,one of the best disney movie of all time
Nov 22 2023,positive,my granddaughter loved it 
Nov 22 2023,positive,great movie perfect way to celebrate disneys 100 celebrations
Nov 22 2023,positive,this was a great disney 100 movie i am not sure how this movie would be for those who dont love disney and the animation and magic that came before it but for someone who does it was great the music is great
Nov 22 2023,negative,meh  not terrible but not great  bland with what looks like cheap animation  feels more like a tv production animated in korea for kids
Nov 22 2023,negative,just terrible worst disney film
Nov 22 2023,positive,its a fantastic classic disney movie but without romance or princess focuses on love for family and the greater we music is so great lots of nods to disneys 100 years they wanted to make a wish for their hundredth birthday
Nov 22 2023,negative,eh its kinda lame also the fact that they used ai to write some of the songs only proves how lazy production and writing has become also it felt more like the king was the protagonist
Nov 22 2023,negative,an accumulation of all disneys latest mistakes shoved into one package with the newest addition is that the animation usually being their one saving grace is noticeably worse than any of their past works it is tensionless and lead by a meandering narrative an onslaught of lackluster music and cringe inducing dialogue i would genuinely be surprised if 6 children would actually be entertained by it cant manage to be mediocre or even so bad its good just boring if this was made by anyone but disney i doubt anyone would remember it  the irony for disney to make a prorevolution movie albeit a toothless one after their latest escapades is not lost on me
Nov 22 2023,negative,didnt enjoy it my kid was not at all into it
Nov 22 2023,negative,the movie is amusing but it lacks some real charm the title song is very good but the other songs arent memorable asha is a good protagonist but feels like a copy of recent princess or lead female roles in other disney movies the movie suffers from the drawback of far to many side characters that take far to much screen time the plot and how some of the events affect some of the characters could have been explored a bit further if some scenes didnt take place good for a one time watch but sadly not a classic
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved the story songs and characters a classic disney feel good inspiring story which comes a full circle
Nov 22 2023,negative,waste of time rehash of previous disney movies
Nov 22 2023,negative,while the animation is mostly well done the songs are terrible and the script is halfbaked with leftover characters from previous disney movies all mixed together in a fairy tale stew its so creatively bankrupt they actually named a fallen star wait for it star they couldnt think of anything even slightly more imaginative how about twinkle or wishie disney is obviously trying to capitalize on nostalgia yet again but this movie only made me nostalgic for a time in my life when i hadnt seen it
Nov 22 2023,positive,finally it feels like disney has returned back to its old ways and gotten out of the culture war dont let the critic score dissuade you this was the perfect movie for my 5 and 2 year olds
Nov 22 2023,negative,generic re hashed tropes written by ai grifting on past magic i just cant do it anymore
Nov 22 2023,positive,i loved the songs and think the artwork is beautiful there is a unique almost 2d effect that pays homage to older disney movies my son 7yo really enjoyed it as well its entertaining full of emotion and fun
Nov 22 2023,positive,a fun watch for sure the songs were pretty catchy
Nov 22 2023,positive,what a magnificent milestone to celebrate its 100th year of entertaining so many generations perfect to be seen this thanksgiving week with family members of various disney eras  the music will have you clapping for joy and will be ranked on the top of everyones playlists  thank you to all that made this movie you made our wishes come true
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is my new favorite movie from walt disney animation studios the animation style on the big screen is gorgeous at all costs is my new favorite disney song this movie is a beautiful love letter to the studio and its 100year history
Nov 22 2023,positive,this was a beautiful love letter to disney animation if you love classic disney youll love this movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,a complete homage to disney 100 with hints tributes and plenty of hidden treasures and mickeys throughout fun lovable characters and storyline 5 stars for 5 wishes
Nov 22 2023,positive,the original content like this is absolutely inspiring the visual style is better in 3d an absolute must watch
Nov 22 2023,positive,this is the perfect movie for disneys 100 anniversary   it harkens back to the classics  the whole family loved it   please see this movie and form your own opinion
Nov 22 2023,positive,a love letter to disney fairytaleand it has a banger for the first villain song in over 10 years     i took off one star because i feel like it could be more fleshed out like what is magnificos backstory
Nov 22 2023,negative,really boring the lyrics didnt have passion definitely losing that magic
Nov 22 2023,negative,boring the humor is really corny the animation looks weird and plot is predictable none of the songs leave an impact either the facial expressions and quirkiness of the characters make me cringe
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was a great movie catchy songs and great story line could have been better than a storybook page type of scenery throughout the entire movie shouldve been similar to many other disney movies
Nov 22 2023,positive,fun for all ages classic disney all the way through 
Nov 22 2023,negative,hot garbage of a movie that deserves a ticket refund no story no theme no research on what desire means to people just focused on wish balls why not go ahead and call them dragonballz and copy that instead songs are alright star is the highlight of a overall dreary affair and noone deserves any respect for making this
Nov 22 2023,positive,the movie brought me back to my childhood memories of classic disney films it was beautifully done the music was unique and cute it was pure disney magic
Nov 22 2023,negative,unfortunately for this disney adult the writing for this movie was for little kids usually their stuff is smartly written for everybody but the script for wish is that kid style writing where they really over explain everything like youre four the animation is beautiful and ariana deboses voice is gorgeous but this movie wasnt made for me take your kids theyll love it
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is the most magical and the most special walt disney movie ever everyone should go see wish in theaters to celebrate 100th anniversary of walt disney company
Nov 22 2023,positive,the music and the story made my heart sing an important message for a world that desperately needs hope
Nov 22 2023,positive,if youve enjoyed the disney classics youll enjoy wish    i loved the music and the visuals honestly impressed with the stylized animations the environments are gorgeous i get that some folks are looking for something new and fresh but this is an intentional love letter to classic disney tales worth the trip to the theater
Nov 22 2023,positive,i absolutely love this movie it is so wonderful and heartfelt it truly feels like the disney magic has returned
Nov 22 2023,positive,so fun to see disney make an original princess story with an origin of the fabled wishing star no less to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the company i think walt would be proud    i really like that they took a risk on a more experimental art style too it looks like some of the modern animated shorts but used in a feature film     love our heroine asha love the return of an actual nefarious and nonmetaphorical villain love the new songs love the message of the film this is an easy 55 from me and a new classic
Nov 22 2023,positive,magical beautiful funny sweet goosebumps tears disney go see this movie absolutely amazing speechless
Nov 22 2023,positive,timeless wonderful and exciting as always in the classic disney tradition even after 100 years disneys wish is a timelessly epic musical spectacle with groundbreaking animation style in the same vein of spiderman into across and soon beyond the spiderverse like nothing youve ever seen in a disney film wonderful performances by ariana debose and chris pine amazing disney storytelling and amazing new songs by julia michaels and benjamin rice as well as an excitingly amazing original score by dave metzger plus some spinetingling thrills chills excitement laughter magic wonder fantasy hope courage loyalty friendship selfdiscovery and adventure of all kinds of proportions including magic ones that must be seen to be believed for all disney fans both old new far wide and away even in spectacular 3d its an adventure a century in the making so big so nostalgic and so magical youve got to see it all for yourself for goodness sake trust me its a wonder to behold what a great way to celebrate disneys 100 years of wonder

Nov 22 2023,positive,very enjoyable and nostalgic
Nov 22 2023,positive,great family movie story was fine nothing groundbreaking or anything like that and i actually though the music was good loved all the disney references in this one
Nov 22 2023,positive,absolutely adorable i was so excited for a princess with my name the art style made me nervous but its beautiful and sweet 3
Nov 22 2023,positive,the hate for this movie feels a bit forced imo especially given its been so hardcore since the first trailer got released personally i found the visuals incredible the songs were great and the characters were very fun asha and magnifico in particular were great and it was wonderful to see disney deliver a truly fun villain again watching him get progressively worse and worse through the movie was really fun ill definitely be seeing this again
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is a very fun disney movie lots of easter eggs and cute moments definitely a reminder no one does animation like disney
Nov 22 2023,positive,a love letter to disney fans one hundred years in the making while not as inventive as modern classics such as frozen moana or encanto it is a beautiful story with catchy songs and an impactful message
Nov 22 2023,positive,i took my 8 and 9 year old to see this they loved the movie and so did i the musical selections were great and the animation was beautiful  disney did a wonderful job with this one
Nov 22 2023,positive,phenomenal music great voice cast and a really hopeful optimistic message exactly what youre looking for when you see a disney animated musical
Nov 22 2023,positive,my 9 year olds enjoyed the movie and they def liked the heros being young girls
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved it great family entertainment fun musical songs and moving story that kept me and the little ones entertained highly recommend 
Nov 22 2023,negative,this a very weakly made movie the villain actually makes logical sense youre not immediately and possibly never on the side of the hero and the king just seems to go from logical and wise to randomly bad it doesnt make any sense he doesnt have any motive or character to him he is just an empty shell of character which makes his actions not believable at all this entire film was extremely poorly written granting everyones wishes even if they are destructive is a very bad movie plot bruce almighty had a similar sequence and even that film made the results more realistic with a world falling apart from everyones granted wish its teaching young people to throw caution to every warning sign this is a terrible message to send a little backstory on the king would help like lets learn about his childhood also what about the main character herself she had zero backstory as well like what happened to her father this was basically a really poor remake of aladdin with more pentagrams but much worse
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was a great movie so many little easter eggs from all of disneys old films the art style was interesting at first but grew on me in the more dramatic shots of the film the beginning of the film felt a little much but towards the end it was very heartwarming cant wait to watch it again on disney
Nov 22 2023,positive,didnt keep the kids interest and i didnt really like the music
Nov 22 2023,negative,its a bad movie the villain is the best character and everything else is terrible
Nov 22 2023,positive,awesome celebration of disney stay through the credits
Nov 22 2023,positive,magical  the girls loved it such a great message about never giving up grandma approved
Nov 22 2023,positive,its not raya or ralph breaks the internet bad but its not really tangled or princess and the frog good either at least for me id imagine some people are gonna adore it as a kid i probably would have loved it but as an adult it was kinda mid       it definitely has a handful of great momentssequences slay queen literally but its not really sustained through the whole movie i was just kinda hoping they were gonna do more with it still worth seeing if youre a disney fan for sure though and honestly the end credits scene is so good in the context of the film that if i were giving the film a star rating it would raise it a whole half star       it feels like a classic fairytale but it comes with the best and worst of that its not super character focused and feels more plotmessage driven which is fine but i was waiting for something a little deeper to happen and it never did a handful of fun twists though it has fantastic ideas that it doesnt have the time to explore so it substitutes exploring them at all with a formulaic and thin plot that dang star is the cutest thing ive seen in my life i want one if theres a clear win from this movie its him the animation and the music outside of the very generic first song were much better than i was expecting but the clear craft that went into the film isnt enough to save its half baked story
Nov 22 2023,positive,i dont understand what these critics are talking about i loved it  my 6 year old loves star the music was great and all the easter eggs were fun  we watch this movie because it is fun and watching our kids enjoy it brings us joy simple
Nov 22 2023,positive,we liked that it was more like an old disney movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie is a return to form for disney after a few years of disappointments some may be critical of certain aspects of the story but there is a deep philosophical subtext between the lines fans will enjoy finding the many easter eggs scattered throughout the film     this will be a film that grows on you and many will revisit it in the years to come
Nov 22 2023,positive,happy 100th anniversary disney great way to celebrate it
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie was so fun and enjoyable asha king magnífico valentino and star really steal the show the music was so fun to hear and for sure keeping it on repeat filled with easter eggs to find without taking you out of the movie definitely will become be part of a classic on my list
Nov 22 2023,negative,wish is a great film to celebrate disneys 100th anniversary asha is a great and sweet protagonist and magnifico is quite the scary villain animation is gorgeous and songs were good great story of all the movie does seem targeted to kids overall with unfunny butt jokes it definitely heavily weighted on the disney references some are cute but most are overwhelmingly bad this movie can be a little forgettable but when i think of it i love it again and want to see it more
Nov 22 2023,positive,great movie for all  we will be going back  my daughter loved it
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is a film that manages to be simple and magnificent i can imagine that wall disney would be proud of the homages to their fairy tales this movie is for all disney fans from the films trailer it seems generic and boring but when you watch it you are surprised by so much magic and excitement its a film to laugh and get emotional it managed to steal some tears asha star valentino and especially king magnífico are incredible and charismatic i loved the king magnífico hes like a classic disney villainthe film is full of references to disney films i loved it and if you love fairy tales you will too
Nov 22 2023,positive,the perfect movie for disneys 100 anniversary
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish shines with its unique animation  songs but is sadly let down by its lousy writing and character development
Nov 22 2023,positive,i really liked this movie it felt new but at the same time familiar i loved all the little references to different disney movies and the music was pretty good im glad i saw it and i might even go see it again the star is very cute and steals the show
Nov 22 2023,negative,great production but it feels like disney is missing the point of this movie the plot doesnt feel strong from their recent movies like encanto frozen and lilo and stitch  disney doesnt realize what their 100 anniversary should be celebrating about all the songs are forgettable like it was made to be fully only for kids their lack of casting and no standout characters the animation feels awful and unfinished
Nov 22 2023,positive,a must for any lover dreamer or wisher
Nov 22 2023,negative,this movie just falls flat  songs arent memorable characters dont develop well storyline is dull  animation just didnt work  had six girls of differing ahes all wanted to leave early  when does one reach a consensus among 6 girls
Nov 22 2023,negative,felt like sofia the first terrible comedy terrible writing
Nov 22 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this chris pine stole the show but i appreciated the subtlety of the homage and the message
Nov 22 2023,negative,terrible dont recommend
Nov 22 2023,positive,wish is a movie the whole family will love you must see it in theaters
Nov 22 2023,negative,pretty visuals but this movie had a really weak plot low stakes and a forgettable song what seemed like every five minutes walked out after 30 minutes
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie is celebration of disney full with easter eggs of past disney films see if you can spot them and love animation to make it feel it like a storybook sure it have it roughy edge like the past disney film in the past decade but the main thing about this film is about wishing and how we can work towards making it come true
Nov 22 2023,positive,combining disney past and disney present wish accomplishes a fun tribute to disney as a whole wish has creative music story and the voice cast is great
Nov 22 2023,negative,this isnt a new original or compelling of a story and was pretty boring
Nov 22 2023,positive,story could have been stronger  yet still didnt stop the magicbetter than i thought it would be kids in the theater applauded at the end of filmguess thats what really matters
Nov 22 2023,negative,after watching disneys wish i have mixed feelings the animation is stunning but the music characters and storyline fell short for me surprisingly i found myself sympathizing with the villain more than the selfserving heroine what is going on
Nov 22 2023,negative,truly was hoping for more from disneys big 100 year anniversary movie and while there are plenty of cute nods i found the film to be far more disappointing than magical i long for the days of musical theater making its return to disney instead of music that feels like its grasping to reclaim the glory of let it go as a whole i knew where this story was heading and i didnt think it took as big of a risk as the film should have    not a blunder but definitely a film i wont remember within a day
Nov 22 2023,positive,imagine listening to complete strangers on the internet telling you what you should and shouldnt watch  see it for yourself this was amazing  loved the songs  the watercolor style and texture actually looks stunning in theaters  highly recommend checking it out especially if you love disney
Nov 22 2023,negative,songs are not exactly as memorable as previous disney movies really forgettable and boring the animation wasnt as thrilling or eye catching either very big disappointment for me and my 13 year old daughter
Nov 22 2023,positive,paid tribute to 100 years of disney animation great visuals well developed villain comedic sidekick great family watch
Nov 22 2023,negative,this film ultimately felt like a cheap swipe at previous disney films its littered with shallow callbacks and jokes that just miss the mark the animation style attempted to harmoniously join the old 2d watercolor with the new 3d rigs but unfortunately simply looked unfinished and borderline ameture especially when compared with projects such as spider verse mitchells vs the machines and arcane which successfully blend the two mediums in a much more professional way the songs were clearly written with the intent of being played on the radio or as standalone music videos and didnt match the pacing or attempted style of the film at all and violently juxtaposed the orchestral score which jarred the audience out of the immersion each time they were introduced pine and deboses performances were good and the dynamic of ashas friend group was fun to see both were often balms for the otherwise lackluster and disappointing film  but however underwhelmed i was from an analytical standpoint i can see how this film with its bright colours and inyourface message of self love would be enjoyable for children just not perhaps the parents watching   a film for kids not the whole family
Nov 22 2023,negative,this was one of the worst disney movies ive seen in a long time it took the worst cliche parts of their recent movies encanto frozen 2 there were so many reused lines and overly exaggerated easter eggs that attempted to make up for the lack of plot
Nov 22 2023,negative,okay animation disneys idea of everyone is a star is a beautiful little idea but the film just lacks normal disney magic i dont know how else to say it normally walk out of the theater singing one of the songs or buzzing about a funny moment or likeable character but that didnt happen this time the most memorable part was the end credits when images of past animations cycled through     come on disney i know you have a few hits still in you you can do better than this
Nov 22 2023,positive,amazing movie a true testament to what disney has accomplished in over 100 years    make sure you see this for yourself
Nov 22 2023,positive,weather you just started enjoying the disney film library or like me youve been a fan since your formative years wish will strike a chord its full of awesome disney easter eggs with a solid story of what happens when good intentions lead to dark places but even then theres still light wishes can never die so long as we keep working towards them
Nov 22 2023,positive,disney sure made me happy with this one the songs are uplifting a little bit more laidback and dont resemble those of more recent disney animated films knowing what i know now is a triumphant standout absolute chills magnifico voiced by chris pine is a cool villain and star is absolutely adorable i thought the film did a nice job of paying homage to walt disney animation studios with clever easter eggs throughout and with a handful of featured characters actually representing characters from past studio films that was cool the disney magic is clearly present im super confused on why critic reviews are so mixed
Nov 22 2023,negative,bad movie kids fell asleep watching would recommend watching on disney at home
Nov 21 2023,positive,it was definitely a great way to celebrate disney 100 anniversary the songs are good and the critics are killing this movie definitely recommend 1010
Nov 21 2023,positive,i absolutely loved wish star and valentino are the cutest im obsessed i loved the freshness of the story but also honoring the legacy of the magic of disney im definitely a disney kid and this movie had everything you want and more great music cute characters an emotion reprise and a great message were all stars go see wish and i hope they put a singalong version out
Nov 21 2023,negative,the same as the other movies        boring 
Nov 21 2023,positive,best disney movie of the 2020s its so good asha is a great new addition to disney princesses valentino is a really cute goat and king magnifico is a great new disney villain he gave me scar ursula jafar maleficent mother gothel gaston and the evil queen vibes and it gave me so much nostalgia feelings i give it a 1010 
Nov 21 2023,positive,so good my kids loved it
Nov 21 2023,negative,there was nothing special about this movie no standout characters no catchy songs or memorable moments this one was a flop i wish id just waited for it to come out on disney it was a waste of money and not worth watching again the plus side is that there were a few cool graphics
Nov 21 2023,positive,magical sweet story diverse characters fun music and lots of nods to your favorite disney  tales
Nov 21 2023,positive,this movie is a beautiful love letter to disney animation it feels like an instant classic truly a mustsee this holiday season
Nov 21 2023,positive,songs could be better  not super inspiring for wishes
Nov 21 2023,positive,i love this movie it had so many disney characters from the credits and i appreciate so many of those happy memories that i had watched wish is the most amazing movie ever with amazing songs designs and voice actors i am glad that disney has been celebrating 100 years and now it was time we had a new generation of new movies to be made
Nov 21 2023,positive,took my two young kids to a disney movie it was simple and a throw back to how disney cartoons should be about hopes dreams and overall just a feel good film with great songs
Nov 21 2023,positive,if u love disney u must see this movie
Nov 21 2023,negative,just looks like a horrible cliche animated movie the songs look like theyll were generated by ai possibly they ran out of ideas and the animation looks so dull as a poor attempt to replicate spiderverses success
Nov 21 2023,positive,its was an absolutly blast all the 100years came together in this one songs were amazing just like the art
Nov 21 2023,positive,an excellent movie in the word of the artistic verb it has a magic touch to the movies seen in the 90s the history of the characters is a key point in the outcome of the story the music has been known to qualify in the backgrounds and to the rhythm of the protagonists and without a doubt a villain with guts and without fear of obstacles similar to scar and finally an appreciation for disney classics including mickey mouse
Nov 21 2023,negative,wish wasnt the best the plot and music were the movies weakest parts
Nov 21 2023,positive,i loved the movie it was really fun to watch and there so much meanings this movie has to it i literally cried watching this one of my favorite movies
Nov 21 2023,negative,the story is very muddled and wasnt that entertaining even for smaller children most of the children in my theatre started walking around the theatre i think that explains how entertaining this movie is the music isnt great either the only earworm music i can think of the first introduction song to the kingdom of rosas the lesson here isnt good and tried to tackle a difficult lesson about rebellion but just failed to teach that lesson all throughout the film
Nov 21 2023,negative,if i wanted to listen to hamilton music i would have just watched the play this is absolute downfall of quality in disneys music
Nov 21 2023,positive,super fun i love all the disney references and the music is stuck in my head for sure i love it
Nov 21 2023,negative,the only thing that would have improved is if we king magnifico see a lot of time
Nov 21 2023,negative,personally as someone who was looking forward to this film for weeks im so disappointed its another one of those movies where the concepts and ideas are so interesting cool and unique but the execution was terrible the idea of a wishing star come to life is so interesting but it barely causes many conflicts in the movie same with asha who interestingly feels so reminiscent of other princesses but has no real character arc or journey like the other famous disney princesses the side characters are just there and gabo was irritating me throughout the film  theres nothing notable about most of it  not good not bad thoroughly average i liked some songs and thats about the only positive i can give it  and for a 100th year anniversary it had the potential to become a cult classic but just ends up being disappointing and not good enough
Nov 21 2023,negative,the animation style felt like a step backwards and the talking goat wasnt funny but the story was interesting end credits were cool as well
Nov 21 2023,positive,this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen the runtime is great for kids the songs are catchy and the animation is wonderful if you love disney or pointing out details this is the film for you star is the cutest thing and asha is relatable a wonderful addition to the disney canon and gives me hope about the future for disney animation critics did not give enough depth in their reviews to stop me from seeing it sorry critics but most of you guys were too unreliable if you are gonna give a movie a bad rating you gotta explain why much better
Nov 21 2023,positive,alright so ive been looking forward to wish ever since d23 last year and along with elemental little mermaid  haunted mansion i finally got to see it this year and the movie did not disappoint me at all star2     it is such a beautiful  entertaining filmtribue to disneys animated classics almost like enchanted but this movies fully animated     loved ariana deboses asha and star is just adorable she went up on my disney heroine list shes not a official princess yet and now i need to have a star plush    chris pine was great as magnifico and i still think his main song in this is a banger    even the supporting characters were great like alan tudyk as valentino goat ashass friends  mom  grandpa even the queen    awesome animation that needs to be seen on the big screen and looks much better  if youre a longtime disney fan there is plenty of easter eggs also i recommend to stay for the credits and the after credit scene    its not on the level of lion king or aladdin but its definitely better than strange world and i did like that movie but wish is better by far and is around the level of like mulan emperors new groove or raya    its definitely on my list now of all time favorite disney movies
Nov 21 2023,positive,well i dont always go on reviews  i am taking my daughter i am sure we will like it  people want every movie to be perfect  ok bye 
Nov 21 2023,positive,wish was the most beautiful love letter to anyone who grew up watching disney movies i laughed and cried and i cant wait to watch it again and again to find even more easter eggs paying tribute to classic disney movies stay for the post credits scene 
Nov 21 2023,positive,unique animation style and the easter eggs were fun to spot stay until the post credits for a fun final easter egg
Nov 21 2023,positive,the whole family loved wish star is definitely the cutest but valentino had some great laughs asha rocks magnifico is an old style evil villain and all the magic and wish spheres are absolutely gorgeous  oh and those songs i can not get them out of my head thanks disney haha  we watched it in 3d and i can not recommend that higher the line work and materials are soooo gorgeous  disney is 100 back
Nov 21 2023,positive,for a younger audience wish will be fine despite the catchy songs this movie is weak
Nov 21 2023,positive,pure magic amazing songs my heart melted in so many parts best animated movie of the year period
Nov 21 2023,positive,wish was wonderful my family and our entire group loved it and my 5yearold has been singing knowing what i know now since we walked out of the theater
Nov 21 2023,positive,this movie is an instant disney classic this wish gives me absolute chills and star has my heart forever
Nov 21 2023,positive,valentino and star carried the movie great movie
Nov 21 2023,positive,try to be careful what you wish for
Nov 21 2023,negative,tbh the only thing i like from this movie is the first music on the credits and the nostalgic references but the movie itself its garbage the music is trash the villian is pretty much a jerk ngl on this it could have been better in 3d to represent the great times of disney having 2d movies ngl rn im pretty sure disney might collapse when mickey is 100      i just hope disney makes better movies in 2024 but theres a high chance that wont happen
Nov 21 2023,negative,there is absolutely no way that the audience reviews are real i love disney movies and this may be the worse thing i have ever seen they have got to quite trying the same story over and over female lead same personality predictable evil villainand the songs are just bad at least go back the the people who wrote songs back in the day everyone in this movie is kind of unlikeableeven her sidekick disney needs to fire everyone and start over
Nov 21 2023,positive,disney animations latest offering is wish it will transport audiences to the whimsical kingdom of rosas it is a magical realm filled with laughter heart and a powerful message about the magic within us the film will be in theaters on november 22nd it features enchanting voice performances by ariana debose chris pine and alan tudyk making it an absolute delight for audiences of all ages     ariana debose voicing the 17yearold heroine asha steals the show with her incredible voice performance and singing deboses talent adds depth to the character making asha relatable and endearing chris pine known for his onscreen charisma surprises audiences with his singing abilities it will leave you craving more of his musical talents in future projects alan tudyk while bringing fun to the film as the voice of ashas pet goat valentino may not be a perfect match yet his whimsical presence will surely entertain the younger audience    the animation feels like a nostalgic trip to classic disney films  it captures the timeless magic that has defined the studio for decades the nods to disneys rich history evoke a celebration hinting at a century of enchanting storytelling though not entirely memorable the soundtrack features catchy tunes contributing to the films overall charm combined with spectacular animation the songs create an immersive experience reminiscent of disneys golden era the plot of wish doesnt delve too deep but swiftly plunges into action and magic keeping the audience engaged from start to finish while the storyline may be straightforward it lays the groundwork for potential sequels and more disney films in a similar style    the additional voice cast including angelique cabral victor garber and natasha rothwell complements the main characters and adds fun to the kingdom of rosas the ensemble of ashas friends portrayed by jennifer kumiyama evan peters harvey guillén ramy youseff niko vargas della saba and jon rudnitsky brings a lively and diverse energy to the film creating a tightknit group that supports and protects asha on her journey    i give wish 4 out of 5 stars it is an ambitious musicalcomedy directed by the oscarwinning duo chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn known for their work on frozen and frozen 2 this film is a magical journey that combines stellar voice performances classic disney animation and a heartfelt narrative
Nov 21 2023,positive,wish is a great tribute to disneys legacy the animation is beautiful the story is good the voice acting is fantastic and the songs are unforgettable i highly recommend watching this movie 1010
Nov 21 2023,positive,a great way to celebrate 100 years of disney
Nov 21 2023,positive,this film is an amazing tribute to disney thank you so much for 100 years of memories
Nov 21 2023,positive,i loved the film i went to the sneak peak and let me just say i laughed and cried and the magic blew my mind yes it related to encanto but i loved that movie too they both are a ten out of ten stars for me it is the best film and honestly i would love to watch this movie as much as possible wherever i can
Nov 21 2023,positive,one of the greatest animated films ever produced my family laughed out load  cried and cheered    practically perfect in every way
Nov 21 2023,negative,the protagonist is bland and boring with the same adorkable personality that rapunzel anna mirabel and moana have which make her feel like a cheap copy of then because at least they have distinguish atributes and reasons her reason is i have to save them to show how selfless and mary sue she is the goat is the worst character that dont add anything to the story the antagonist is okay but is far to be as good as any other disney villain was even hans is better the other characters are forgetable so is the protagonist friend group i think this was the worst disney movie that i ever watched i rather see chicken little than this thing the musics are boring and not rememberble
Nov 21 2023,positive,amazing movie and its so perfectly fit for disney 100 years theme wishing star is the magic and music is beautiful it really touched my heart
Nov 21 2023,neutral,disney trying to make fun of itself like with with frozen but at least frozen was memberible
Nov 21 2023,positive,fun and charismatic characters flat villain with good chris pine voiceovers liked how a wish is then compared to our soul entity is power they should have explored that more and the movie would be a 5star
Nov 21 2023,positive,it back to fun and comedy great movie loved the songs went to the premiere but are going to go again with friends
Nov 21 2023,positive,disney looks at itself in the mirror and smiles  what better way to cap off the animated musical wish a toe dip into creativity with a drowning splash of mediocrity i think i speak for everyone over 12 when i say that wish couldve been better  i say that with both harsh and childlike optimism this is disneys most recent original animated movie with creative directions for the plot and action sequences thats the positive view of it an alternative depiction is that wish displays how the company feels feeding the masses who watch their movies trying to give what they want without receiving much respect for the effort and imagination they put into the entire last year  jokes aside wish feels too flat to apply to reality in a meaningful way and feels more like an anecdote of the perception held by the disney company  asha is a generic disney princess except we learn she isnt a princess so she doesnt even have that going for her i literally cant describe her in any way outside of cares too much a trait held by only the most dangerous of us humans you could argue that her role is to let kids imagine themselves as her on her journey except i really wouldnt want to be in ashas shoes since she proves time and time again that she isnt really capable of anything and just barely manages to squeeze by any scene involving danger id be dead if i were in her shoes  as for the theme your dreams can come true if you have a chance to fight for them true sometimes but also kinda meaningless its like saying you can work to become a doctor even though you dont have the skill set or dedication the reason a lesson like that rings empty is because if your dream isnt every single thing you thought it was after working for it you might not even want that dream anymore the next generation of kids is going to be messed up  ashas friends the bread and butter of the movie disposable substances that pale in comparison to even junk food i had to resist making jokes about how they were a multicultural group hired to be ashas friend then i thought that some disney guy just kept suggesting different races of characters to include in ashas friend group until he listed all the ones he was familiar with which was seven yeah i know theyre based on the seven dwarves but come on they barely do anything in the movie a claim which is also reserved for asha star and the goat i think her friends only serve one purpose in the movie and that is to demonstrate the castles complete lack of security  the plot is okay  i want to say the plot is good for an hourlong movie and that the protagonists and supporting characters need to do more but no that is not true in any way there is much filler and music and filler music spoilers i know the finale is resolved while theyre singing but goddamn this movie should be like thirty minutes long with a plot like this just so much antics and distractions and running around they arent even good distractions like chaos and destruction just talking animals and trees singing animals and trees thats it nothing unique or crazy disneys definition of crazy is animals that talk and sing and that is all we have time for in an hour and 20minute movie  magnifico is definitely the best part of the movie so far hes a real villain remember when everyone had a problem with that nearly 5 years to make someone irredeemably evil because theyre selfish hes pretty intense too i honestly think asha shouldve lost this one  wish is a hopeless dreamdry creatively bankrupt movie it kind of sums up disney as a whole stuck in the past greedy and selfish some crazy guys in charge its incredible how different it is from other disney movies but it is so clear how small the changes are when compared to every known film in existence the main character isnt a princess she doesnt fall in love the main bad guy is genuinely evil and there may or may not be jewish characters in the movie im sad to report that despite what anyone says this movie is currently disney at its best if you can understand that much then you can understand that no marvel movie can fix this
Nov 21 2023,neutral,the protagonist was nothing new the concept is very basic the side characters werent fun and the story is very predictable the only bright side is the music
Nov 21 2023,positive,it is an absolute stunning film to watch the main character asha is likable and kind the story line moves smoothly and the comedic lines land well the villain is amazing wow hes an equal to scar from the lion king in my book amazingly good job chris pine     my only complaint is that at times with the assemble cast of her friends it can seem like im watching disney junior with their playful banter and silly jokes as an adult its not really my thing but a child may enjoy it i definitely recommend it for disney fans
Nov 21 2023,positive,saw a free screening on 1120    if you are a big disney fan this is required viewing    if you are indifferent its an enjoyable movie     pros  cute characters  some of the strongest vocal performances in disney history  genuinely funny moments  beautiful animation    cons  only a few good songs  takes some time to get going  somewhat underdeveloped villain    all of the kids in the theatre were enthralled and had a good time a wellspent 15 hrs i do encourage you to see it on the big screen because the animation styles really shine
Nov 21 2023,positive,just the right story to celebrate 100 years of storytelling  possibly one of the most song heavy disney films
Nov 21 2023,positive,wish felt like a classic disney musical film great music a fun story with a heartfelt message and the film sparkles with the disney magic we all fell in love with as kids    the film is gorgeous to view with an intriguing new animation style for disney the backgrounds are stunning and really blends a classic animation style with newer animation styles    the music is fun with some clear standouts perhaps not as many hits as you find in frozen encanto or moana but still enjoyable music and the songs fit the film well     the clear standouts in the film are ariana debose who stuns as asha and chris pine who gives us a deliciously devilish new disney villain magnifico however the biggest star of them all just happens to be star such an adorable new character who is brought to life beautifully     the ending of the film the emotional climax really hits you in the feels and all the subtle and sometimes not subtle references are beautiful throwbacks to the various eras of disney so many generations grew up with     wish may not be the most groundbreaking animated film to come from disney but it is certainly a brand new classic that many will want to watch over and over again
Nov 21 2023,positive,dont let the critics deter your interest in this movie it delivers a powerful message urging adults not to abandon their dreams and encourages children to pursue theirs despite obstacles while the storytelling may not be flawless the underlying meaning is clear and impactful the film boasts touching moments and features some standout songs that enhance the overall experience
Nov 21 2023,positive,i just seen you today and its great movie i wish everyone a happy 100 years of disney magic
Nov 20 2023,positive,this movie was a pleasant surprise and its a must see for disney fans a story where the heroine has support from her friends a queen and her loved ones it is wholesome with memorable songs plot and cinematic experience will definitely rewatch to try and catch all the disney easter eggs
Nov 20 2023,negative,millennial core movie bland animation and feels ai generated
Nov 20 2023,positive,represents well what disney has done around its 100 years and has a bad guy whos kinda relatable but also evil music was what you expect of a disney movie and the characters are kinda mid theyre not pretty memorable but they are not unsopportable as on the recent disneypixar films like lightyear or encanto but theyre characters that feel alright on the film  the animation is well done despite it does not look revolutionary as spiderverse or puss in boots the last wish but the animation is smooth and looks different than most of animated movies today at theatres  wish is the experience that you can enjoy if you want to watch a good disney movie the movie is made more for the disney fans because it shows how far the studio has gone in 100 years but for general audience is a mid funny musical movie made by disney
Nov 20 2023,positive,overall the movie is a very enjoyable time while there some problems with some of the characters and some dialogue scenes if you just focus on the protagonist and their journey then kids and most parents will get through it joyfully
Nov 20 2023,positive,i like that song knowing what i know now
Nov 20 2023,positive,loved it so much visually beautiful  an incredible score and endearing characters  the disney magic is real 
Nov 20 2023,positive,uplifting heartwarming and some incredible music
Nov 20 2023,positive,it seems like an awesome movie to enjoy with and i am excited to see that with great characters including asha
Nov 20 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the colors were beautiful the songs were fun and catchy and the character development was good my kids ages 10 8  5 all loved it it was really a love letter of sorts for nostalgic disney fans with fun easter eggs and different moments in the film that paid homage to classic disney films magnifico was a great villain and it was fun going on the journey with asha and watching her become a true heroine and leader i really hope the critics get a grip and start appreciating this film for what it truly is a colorful and nostalgic representation of our beloved disney company trying to bring magic and beauty into our lives and the world
Nov 20 2023,negative,i am sorry i think that disney needs to take a break and try to get back to its roots and tell stories that people want to escape into i remember being a child and my parents taking me to the disney movies it was such a treat i am now a parent and my kids dont want to go to disney movies as they are not fun or worse yet uncomfortable wish is just another miss by disney the problem is that all of these movies take years to create and by the time they realize they are bad they have invested so much money that they cant just abandon the project wish is just a poor movie and i am sad to say i miss the golden days of the disney amazing movies
Nov 20 2023,negative,this was not enough to win back audiences just wait for streaming services and save your money especially families families left my theatre disheartened  confused  with so much ips mentioned  easter eggs this failed to commemorate the magical legacy that disney once was more adults will care for the historical circle of completion this gives disney movie universe but children will fail to grasp the big picture  the confusing misleading message of every wish deserves a chance remember in life not all wishes are good in this reviewers opinion  asha is the real villain setting into motion a series of events that lead to the downfall of a just king driven to darkness by the actions of a selfish brat theres two sides to every story  this one was too complex for audiences to endorse soundtrack is beautiful but thats not enough to save this box office bomb
Nov 20 2023,positive,disneys wish brings back the memories of walt disneys 2d animated classics with cgi and handdrawn 2d animation effects its a true miracle disney wish has to offer all thumbs up
Nov 20 2023,positive,it gave me goosebumps its great that it is an original story with cute nods to disneys past the songs and voice talent are great obsessed with star
Nov 20 2023,positive,the return of a classic disney villain sure to make his way into the halloween festivities beautiful story and animation tons of laugh out loud moments perfect thanksgiving holiday treat yet again thanks disney for keeping good clean fun family entertainment alive the only thing that couldve made this special 100 celebration more magical wouldve been the return of legendary composer alan menken
Nov 20 2023,positive,it was good not great but not bad better than some of the ones as of late
Nov 20 2023,positive,masterpeice of disney lore
Nov 20 2023,positive,i loved it i wanted to watch again as soon as it was over i am of an age that i pretty much remember every disney movie i loved all the references and nods to the past i need to watch it again to see what i missed with that the story is nothing original but totally enjoyable
Nov 20 2023,negative,the narrative arc of the villain is more interesting than that of the protagonist but also because the ending lets us understand that ashas role is much more important than that of the other princesses in the disney universe even the friends around her seemed to have more nuanced personalities than hers in the end i found this movie really boring
Nov 20 2023,positive,the movie is good but not great its definitely pretty to look at and the songs are good but its pretty generic
Nov 20 2023,negative,unique animation but absolutely awful music and boring plot another embarrassing misfire on their big 100 year anniversary only a few of the easter eggspeter pan and mary poppinswere funny they should have done something like the disney plus short
Nov 20 2023,positive,heartwarming and filled with hope
Nov 20 2023,positive,caught the early preview and was pleasantly surprised took 3 kids and they all adored it
Nov 20 2023,negative,tired character designs nothing special from the water color overlay and lacking a good story what happened to the disney villain with no redeemable qualities whats with the lin manuel miranda lite musicyawn
Nov 20 2023,positive,disneys wish is an amazing movie with an incredible cast and story the story is for everyone but it lacks on certain elements and sometimes its a little messy but with that aside that story is fantastic the characters are incredible and dont even get me started on asha shes incredible in this movie specially when she is hitting on those notes overall the movie is incredible and fun that the whole family can enjoy
Nov 20 2023,positive,its a ok movie theres quite a lot of flaws with it but overall its   fine i really liked the animation though
Nov 20 2023,negative,if everyone got what they wished for this movie wouldnt exist
Nov 20 2023,positive,a wonderful sentiment humorous moments and music that lives up to disneys legacy my almost 6 year old and i are obsessed with the music
Nov 20 2023,negative,i didnt like it disney cant make movies like before its kinda sad actually i really hope they can make something real good
Nov 20 2023,positive,wish is a tribute to the legacy of disney studio animation with gorgeous visuals a catchy soundtrack and a henhouse of easter eggs star and valentino alan tudyk steal the show and ariana debose confidently steps into her role as the newest disney heroine king magnifico chris pine is a genuine villain who uses trifling generosity to mask the hoarding of his peoples magic to maintain his power his fate is a satisfying easter egg in its own right bottom line  disney fans will feast on the tributes stay till the end and new viewers may become fans after seeing this movie
Nov 20 2023,negative,bring back the old art style the old fandom the old fans the old everything like this isnt a normal movie for disney its the 100th one so its suppose to be extremly special not the same main character movie after movie after movie i saw an ad about this trailer when going to see the new trolls movie and i pretty much looked at it as if it was weird like i remember thinking wtf bro why do they all act the same that aint me 100 and it aint anyone anymore
Nov 20 2023,positive,its messy and certainly a far cry from disneys peek era in animation but the gorgeous animation talented cast and fun musical sequences save it from its flaws
Nov 20 2023,negative,beautifully rendered but ultimately forgettable with a weak narrative and songs that no one will leave the theater humming this is one neither for the heart or the head as with so many recent disney features
Nov 20 2023,positive,havent seen it but i wanna give this love so it deserves more fresh and to the critics stop killing this movie its disneys love letter to the classics and it is the 100th anniversary of disney needs to be better than the trashy strange world help this movie score go higher
Nov 20 2023,positive,my kids loved the songs and we all enjoyed trying to spot the references to other disney movies everyones a critic these days this ones for the kids and they eat it up
Nov 20 2023,negative,technically unoffensive  narrative convoluted and stilted in pacing  there are no worse songs in a disney movie than this one  its giving  sabotaged purposefully kind of looking forward to the youtubepng tubermovie reviews that read into it like i did  where it seems apparent the workforce wasnt happy with the company and sabotaged its vanity pic to talk about the internal greed and issues at the company dismantling the uncle walt 100 year project and some of the past controversies 
Nov 20 2023,negative,i went to an early release and found the music is poorly written i feel the lyrics were written by ai the references are shoe horned in the movie suffers from lazy writing the villain is flat and dull there is nothing that makes me want to root for the main character
Nov 19 2023,positive,disney animated features are usually the best of the best but this one was just ok it fell flat for me to be honest wish felt more of a nostalgia trip full of easter eggs rather than a full fledged feature i dont see this comparable to any of the past films that this movie references    what was good was ariana debose and chris pine they really bring life to the characters they played and their songs were very fun and catchy as amazing as they are the movie as a whole just felt stale and unoriginal disney usually kills it in their animated films so this was a rare miss for me still it was nice to reflect on past disney movies and try to spot all the fun easter eggs throughout the film i would definitely recommend this movie but its definitely not the next big disney hit
Nov 19 2023,negative,its an ad for disney products its literally just a feature length cartoon movie about disney products theyre so desperate they cant help themselves
Nov 19 2023,negative,the plot was lacking compared to recent disney animated movies
Nov 19 2023,neutral,disney tried way too hard to make this movie overly diversified the jewish grandpa has a son who married a black lady and having a black granddaughter main character they are living in a city with a mexican name ruled by an arab king with that said the story was goodnot spectacular they made references to many classic disney movies some of the references were fun but others felt forced
Nov 19 2023,positive,a wonderful way to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of disney from the catchy songs mix of hand drawn animation and cg to the delicious hark back to a true disney villain this movie has it all all of the little easter eggs throughout the film which get more obvious as the film progresses and then at the very end just become glaringly obvious are a brilliant nod to all films that have amounted to this  very film you can tell the film makers had a ton of fun inserting all of them i cant wait to watch it over and over and spot more of them there must be at least 100 there are moments of joy and tears in this film and im so happy that disney seem to be right back on track with this wonderful celebratory film
Nov 19 2023,negative,man this really isnt disneys year the marvels was already expected to be a huge bomb but this being their 100th anniversary movie the amount of hate towards it online was staggering and although i went into wish wanting to prove the naysayers wrong its a bad movie  the animation is gorgeous sometimes the disney callbacks and the songs were ok and the villain was kind of entertaining   but the comedy never landed most of the songs are bland the characters are boring and the movie feels rushed  the film is not awful and families might find it passable but this might be one of the biggest cinematic slaps in the face ever disney for their 100th anniversary movie gives audiences a 90 minute piece of fluff
Nov 19 2023,positive,walt disney animation studios receives a score of 100 for its 100th anniversary fantasy feature wish  a fast moving magical song filled animated movie for kids of all ages  be sure to stay for an after credits special magical treat
Nov 19 2023,positive,was able to take my kids to an advanced showing saturday 1118 this film is a great callback to the old disney films     i do not know what the critics panning this film were looking for or were expecting it was a good story the music was fun knowing what i know now will hopefully be huge song    i enjoyed it as did my kids and that is all that matters
Nov 19 2023,positive,just saw it it was awesome i dont care what anyone says about this movie it was a perfect finale for the 100th anniversary of disney cant wait for whats more to come for disney like sequels and stuff
Nov 19 2023,negative,reading the audiences reviews you get a feeling they were written by disney staff
Nov 19 2023,positive,what a such amazing movie beautiful and your they make laugh and wonderful magic and masterpiece an imagination for all family you will dancing and sing for musicals numbers this is cinema
Nov 19 2023,positive,well i finally saw it through the early access screenings the critics really did this dirty maybe except for the villain song being way too poppy so hopefully audiences will receive this film as a whole outside of that one issue better when they see it next week a la the greatest showman however i was won over by the voice acting ariana debose and chris pine nail it in their respective roles of asha and king magnifico the story being about standing up for whats right and the films overall feel of being a fitting tribute to 100 years of disney magic and wonder only three of julia michaels songs this wish knowing what i know now and at all costs were bangers and yep star the cute and adorable ball of energy that comes down from the sky to help asha and her friends steals the entire film as its mvp and will become your next disney character obsession i do end the review by saying this next time you do a musical film disney hire alan menken stephen schwartz or any musical theater songwriters please and make stories with stronger writing
Nov 19 2023,positive,this is pure magic it feels like a disney classic and is all new and all fun will be nominated best animated feature film and also best original song
Nov 19 2023,positive,loved it great message stay thru the credits everyone in my theater clapped at the end
Nov 19 2023,positive,disneys wish was a beautiful and captivating love letter that not only celebrates 100 years of the studio but also shares a story that can inspire new dreamers of all ages the watercolor animation style using 2d and 3d animation was so stunning and beautiful to see on the big screen the characters were all memorable and enjoyable each having a moment to shine the songs are definitely catchy as well as captivating with the storybook style visuals attached especially with at all costs this wish and knowing what i know now as for the easter eggs it felt like there were plenty to find for disney fans young and old but at the same time didnt distract from the main story overall this film is perfect to view with the whole family and can surely become the next disney classic
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish is a great movie to watch i loved the characters including asha king magnifico star and the others i also love the easter eggs they had in the movie there were a lot of references to them     the music is really great the one that didnt stick out to me was this is the thanks i get it just felt weird using new slang terms when one of the characters is old     however there were a bit of problems for me the kingdom of rosas and corona from tangled are very similar to each other if they were to mix it up i think it wouldve been better but there were so many similarities between tangled and wish     overall its a really solid movie tiktok is trashing the movie but they have no idea whats really happening in this film
Nov 19 2023,positive,loved the music and the animation hope we get to see these characters again soon loved it
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish was delightful to watch this is the movie ive been craving to see for years loved the characters the music the themes and the humour sure it is a little generic but id argue that thats what makes it good it awakened that childlike spirit of the older disney films that i missed in the newer ones i can appreciate that a movie made to reference older works is going to be inherently similar to previous works and i think thats the true beauty of it
Nov 19 2023,negative,the film has a lot disney references and easter eggs and like every disney story it is another cliché story that tries tô innovate but unfortunately fails 01
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish is a such powerful history for this combined 2d and 3d liking vibes puss n boots the last wish or spiderman across the spiderverse  is an absolute masterpiece to tribute the 100th anniversary for walt disney studios many easter eggs and references ariana debose brought so much character to asha valentino was so hilarious and king magnifico was a very interesting villain loved pretty much every song and the animation this is what i want for disney animation studios to move forward for this original musical classic and includes a little music pop or modern music and also it was emotional and i understood the song like people promiseing to be with u at all costs n at the end they change or die it was very deep i must say the entire message in the movie was hope congratulations for crew    is a pure magic and feels like a disney classic    thank you walt disney animation studios you did a great honor for all of us thats all folks
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish reminded me of the disney that i loved as a kid the blended animation style of watercolor painting and cg was gorgeous and the music was quite good
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish is a wonderful homage to everything that is disney animation in a way its everything most have wanted from disney for a while a good hero vs villain narrative which features the selfless asha and well established king magnifico beautiful painterly computer animation which shows its true brilliance on a big theater screen proving that its better to see these films in theaters not to mention the backgrounds pay homage to the art of eyvind earle production designer of sleeping beauty add that with diverse supporting characters a great voice cast brilliantly structured musical numbers and a realistic twist on the fantasy message wish is something that must be seen to be believed
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish sends a powerful message that you need to see its wonderful and magical and youtube and twitter did the film no justice with compressed files  the animation is spectatcular and the score and sound design is just chefs kiss  ariana and chris shines as the leads  i did could do with less goat tbh but the star superstar is star
Nov 19 2023,positive,wow this disney film truly delivers a little rough in the beginning as you get comfortable with the characters but by the end its insanely epic in song and excitement some characters reminded me of the seven dwarfs yet still lovable and supportive in this film
Nov 19 2023,positive,before i start ignore the review bombers a great celebration of all things disney with a unique storyline bounding off the studios greatest successes to an enchanting soundtrack great messaging and aweinspiring visuals star is the standout alongside the vocals some great scenes including awesome homage to disneys catalogue of films a classic made for the big screen
Nov 19 2023,positive,a great movie for the entire family with a touching message and fantastic visuals and wonderful songs
Nov 19 2023,positive,loved that this movie takes me back to what disney truly is i will see this movie again well done disney 
Nov 19 2023,positive,in an era of stale live action remakes it was nice to see disney attempt an original story while not completely reinventing the wheel i have to give credit for them atleast taking the first step to correct the course theyve been on
Nov 19 2023,positive,this movie is pretty special
Nov 19 2023,positive,this movie was really good it has so many meanings in it it just looks like this kids story book the songs are really good and this might be one of my favorites if not 3rd fav
Nov 19 2023,positive,a prequel and love letter of sorts to disney magic stunning mixed animation style a couple of mid songs pulled up by some really catchy wholesome ones
Nov 19 2023,positive,very cute fun movie visually stunning really fun songs and an enjoyable cast of characters asha and magnifico were particularly great and i can only hope this is disney returning to its fun villain roots
Nov 19 2023,positive,wish is such a beautiful emotionally heart driven movie its a tribute to disneys 100th anniversary with different nods to their films while still standing on its own ariana debose was amazing  chris pine was electric as the new villain the music is fresh  new it really sets the tone for the film of course this movie has its cons but i cant find many  i cannot wait to watch this movie again btw youll fall in love with star  valentino
Nov 19 2023,positive,it doesnt do anything new but its a return to basics that has been desperately needed for disney also has some banger tracks i hope this is the start of a return to greatness for the mouse
Nov 19 2023,positive,the film can keep its change but wish remains a fun addition to walt disney animated studios
Nov 19 2023,positive,while having standout moments this is an aboveaverage new disney animated feature the animation worked for me and some of the new songs were fantastic i really enjoyed how it was a culmination of the last 100 years of disney
Nov 19 2023,positive,disneys wish spoiler free review    disney was founded on october 16 1923 and 2023 marks the 100year anniversary of all the magic commemorating this milestone wish provides a tribute to the disney legacy and how it has inspired multiple generations over the past century the film is meant for fans of disney and encompasses the spirit of the prior 61 animated films    side note if you have not seen the once upon a studio short go watch it    asha is such a great main character and you are drawn to how she sees all the possibilities in the world each character has a connection to disney classics like the seven dwarves peter pan the evil queen etc they are engaging and creative plus the star is ridiculously cute and i loved how alan tudyk brought valentino to life i am not sure i will ever locate every single easter egg contained in the 95minute runtime but the ones i did find made my heart happy     the songs were improved seeing them in the context of the film compared to when i was streaming and currently my favorites are at all costs and wish the animation style reminds me of disney tv series like sophia the first versus the typical animated disney feature films of the past decade     as a lifelong disney fan this film aimed itself square into my soul there were three separate times i cried and while the final time was because of how beautiful the moment was i can not tell you why the other two made me weepy     wish was a wonderful culmination of all the joy hope and possibility that has existed in the world of disney disney reminds us that when you wish upon a star your dreams come true    all you need is faith trust and a little bit of pixie dust
Nov 19 2023,positive,this movie was amazing did it honor disneys legacy no was it great yes the villain is menacing songs are great and movies funny take your kids to see this
Nov 19 2023,positive,really nice movie saw it in previews fun for young or young at heart
Nov 19 2023,positive,what a love letter to disneys history the easter eggs were incredible and the music and plot were fantastic i was very worried i would not enjoy this and am so glad i was proven wrong the story was heavy on the nostalgia while still standing on its own
Nov 19 2023,positive,cute  lots of fun disney easter eggs  story was fresh but odd twist with trust  liked disney characters during the credits  really nostalgic end credit scene too
Nov 19 2023,negative,ugh why do kids movies need to be so preoccupied with adult themes i couldnt get over all of the toxic masculinity at center stage the king was a jerk the songs were utterly forgettable how do these terrible movies get approved
Nov 19 2023,positive,absolutely amazing the storyline is awesome the music and songs are incredible thanks for reminding us to always believe and reach for the stars i just loved the ending after the credits disney thanks for always encouraging us to be our best and to never stop dreaming
Nov 19 2023,negative,mixed 2d and 3d animation was more of a distraction and it would have been better if they had just chosen 1 style enjoyed the easter eggs of past disney movies but felt the story was lacking
Nov 19 2023,positive,i just came back from an early showing of wish and it was fine while the cast animation and the music was great most of its music except for a couple of the songs such as this is the thanks i get and the plot were pretty forgettable the pacing of the movie doesnt really help with it either it felt as if there were opportunities to add more to the plot in the middle of the movie but that is just me but even with these downsides i still had an enjoyable time watching this movie and im glad disney actually put an actual villainno twist villain or no villains
Nov 19 2023,positive,this movie appears to be so intriguing that it deserves an a and a good sign that good old disney is back on track
Nov 19 2023,positive,disney making a comeback i absolutely loved this movie the concept and character development was excellent and there were definitely parts of the movie that tugged on my heart strings i dont know what movie the critics were watching because this one was a hit in my books highly recommend wish to families and people of all ages
Nov 19 2023,negative,remember in the making of frozen 2 when they figured out the point of the whole movie at the last minute and saved the day wish is what happens when they run out of time
Nov 19 2023,positive,loved it  the story the characters the music the animation all of it was fantastic  what a wonderful tribute to disneys 100th year  definitely a must see for all disney fans
Nov 19 2023,positive,this is not the most original story in the disney portfolio but it is really a thank you to fans whove seen the rest of the classic disney films great songs the kids loved comic relief nothing controversial and finally a new villain really cool animation style too my family loved it
Nov 19 2023,positive,the kids loved it  we laughed a lot  great for everyone
Nov 19 2023,negative,nothing to keep kids attention boring
Nov 19 2023,positive,in my view it was a love letter to disney fans with remakes and marvel movies being a majority of disney productions wish was a breath of fresh air
Nov 19 2023,positive,it will be hopefully good
Nov 19 2023,negative,the film just didnt feel like it tried very hard it felt like it just did the bare minimum to get by its a film i actually couldve agreed just be dumped onto disney  more mixed than anything 
Nov 19 2023,negative,just got done with the early access and am frankly disappointed  the plot was okay if a little cliche and predictable its a kids movie so yeah we know but frankly whats unforgiveable and inexplicable from disney is how awful the songs were disney is known for its musical numbers and they usually resonate around a concept i just cant wait to be king let it go surface pressure but these were like someone decided there wasnt enough music in the end product and went back and redid whole scenes as songs exposition heavy and utterly bopless it had what felt like one real disney song and even that was a b level of effort from someone we all know is a massively talented and capable singer i dont know what happened here but it has no chance coming up against trolls maybe this is the annual write off
Nov 18 2023,positive,this was the first time my daughter goes to the movies and we couldnt pick a better one it was a very delightful experience
Nov 18 2023,positive,a very fun and fantastic fairy tale about the fight against a greedy ruler with wonderful songs and animation asha is a very great lead and the villain is hilariously devious
Nov 18 2023,positive,epic heartfelt emotional and heartwarming tribute to everything disney has given all of us over the last century while also telling a heartwarming story of its own and setting the stage for the next century of disney magic perfect film for any and all disney fans with tons of easter eggs galore
Nov 18 2023,positive,amazing felt like an old school disney movie loved the mix of computer generated and handdrawn characters are great songs are next level easter eggs are so fun
Nov 18 2023,positive,pros  star is the standout of the film so be prepared for him to have plenty of disney merch  arianna debose and chris pine are incredible as asha and king magnifico but there character traits are mostly derivative of other disney princesses and villains   angelique cabral was also pretty good as queen amaya  most of the songs are pretty catchy and upbeat with some really emotional moments as well  disney references galore if you are a hardcore disney fan like myself youll definitely have a fun time with this film   alan tudyk absolutely steals the show as valentino  visuals are absolutely stunning and beautiful   overall it does a pretty good job telling the story how the famous wishing star came to be    cons  not enough character development there are some times where you are supposed to feel a certain way and is supposed to be a big emotional moment but with the lack of character development its hard to really emphasize with them   king magnifico and asha are derivative of every other typical princess and villain but still were very enjoyable to watch the same goes for every other character as well they are all just copies of some of our favorite disney characters we know and love for example queen amaya is clearly elsa and ashas friends are obviously the seven dwarfs with some of them even describing themselves as grumpy and sneezy   very basic and typical plot like every other disney film    conclusion      overall this film was an enjoyable watch and would definitely recommend to at least check it out if your looking for a good time with the family or are a massive disney fan like me the music was overall pretty good however despite that this film is just your regular same old disney film this is supposed to be disney big 100th year anniversary film and if this is as best as the original content is going to get the company has really reached a new low
Nov 18 2023,positive,this is the best disney movie ever watched
Nov 18 2023,positive,absolutely gorgeous film an astonishing dedication to the history of disney itself a tribute to the magic it keeps on giving in the past 100 years and i am in emotions for the display of sheer magic and heart it provides highly recommend to all dreamers alike

Nov 18 2023,positive,a great movie that celebrates 100 years of disney makes you feel every emotion it tries to make you feel unique animation style similar to the images in a fairy tale book great songs characters and story
Nov 18 2023,positive,its not perfect sure but its a fun throwback to disneys legacy and is sure to be a memorable inspiring classic in years to come
Nov 18 2023,positive,there are trolls giving negative  made up eviews of the movie see for yourself the kids loved it
Nov 18 2023,positive,watched it on an early screening absolutely loved it great song and classic story that feels modern and at the same time a homage to all the classic beloved films i really liked it and i think its a great way to celebrate the impressive disney legacy stay until the credits end for a great post creditscene
