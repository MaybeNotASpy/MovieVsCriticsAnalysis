"Jan 17, 2024",negative," Some messages on not settling when searching for true love, even if said true love happens to be the Grim Reaper. Reflections on mortality, on trying to live a good and honest life. Bill refuses to sell his media company to a greedy corporation, even if it would make him even richer, as he extols the virtues of honest and straightforward news reporting. There's a subplot concerning an elderly Jamaican woman dying in a hospital who recognizes Joe Black as the Grim Reaper, leading to discussions in which he breaks into a terrible Jamaican accent. No racial or ethnic diversity otherwise. Parents need to know that Meet Joe Black is a 1998 romantic fantasy movie in which Brad Pitt plays Death. A man is struck and killed by a bus and a car while standing in the middle of an intersection in New York City. Some language, including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" ""ass,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""goddamn,"" ""damn,"" and ""hell."" A sex scene contains no nudity. Some talk about sex. Cocktail and wine drinking. There's a subplot concerning an elderly Jamaican woman dying in a hospital who recognizes Joe Black as the Grim Reaper, leading to discussions in which he breaks into a terrible Jamaican accent.

In MEET JOE BLACK, Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a successful media mogul who is about to celebrate his 65th birthday in grand style. Meanwhile, his daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is a med student who has seemingly met Mr. Right (Brad Pitt) in a coffee shop while on her way to work, but after they part ways, it seems that they will never see each other again. Little does Susan know that the man she just met is about to be hit and killed while standing in an intersection, but that night, he appears as a dinner guest of her father's. This guest had first appeared to Bill as a voice in his head, but it doesn't take long for Bill to realize that this voice and this man is none other than Death, who has taken on the body of the man who was struck and killed in traffic, and Death has come to take Bill away. Meanwhile, Susan thinks it's the guy she met at the coffee shop, and Death decides that he wants to go by Joe Black and hang around for a while and learn about life from Bill, love from Susan, and the joys of eating peanut butter from a spoon from Bill's hired help. As Bill's time for departure looms ever closer, he must fend off a hostile takeover of his company from Susan's former fiancé, as Joe/Death begins to feel an increasing attraction to Susan. A gimmicky premise is made even worse by iffy acting, hilariously bad dialogue, and a slow pace. Not even the acting chops of Anthony Hopkins can rescue Meet Joe Black, a movie that lumbers along back and forth between some sort of romantic dramedy and reflections on Life and Death and What Does It All Mean, Anyway? Brad Pitt's performance is a real head-scratcher. Why is Death such a spaced-out, wide-eyed goof who develops a fondness for peanut butter? And there were many layers of bad decisions that led to Pitt engaging in a cringe-y ""Irie, mon"" accent when Death meets a dying elderly Jamaican woman in the hospital where his love interest works. It's three hours long, at least one hour too long for this kind of schlock. Families can talk about how Death is portrayed in Meet Joe Black. How is it considered to be ironic to have an actor like Brad Pitt playing this role?

"Mar 28, 2023",positive,[A] glossy but overlong update of Mitchell Leisen’s 1934 comedy Death Takes a Holiday. 
"Dec 20, 2022",positive," Nothing like a movie with a good lore behind it. Like the stories behind the story of The Room, I finally succumbed to watching Meet Joe Black — director Martin Brest’s 3 hour drama-fantasy-romance from 1998. Browsing through Twitter, I came across the absolutely bizarre car accident scene with a 30-something Brad Bitt and Claire Forlani. Rather than lean on CGI, crew molded a dummy from Pitt’s body that in one take,  actually crashed through the windshield inches from a stunt driver’s head.  Like a lunar eclipse, the wild scene makes the rounds every now and then to be discovered by a new generation. From those images, you can’t help but be seduced into watching the whole marathon melodrama. The film itself was a flop, with a $90 million production budget that grossed only $44 million in the states. But thanks to Brad Pitt ping-ponging off two cars on a Manhattan street, Meet Joe Black has become something of a cult classic in recent years. It currently has a 7.2 rating on IMDB. The film plods along from the very first shots inside media mogul Bill Parrish’s (Anthony Hopkins) Gilded Age-seeming bedroom. Is he Rockefeller? Charles Foster Kane? On the cusp of a milestone birthday, Bill is slowly dying. But it’s not enough to show him waking up in the dead of night clasping his heart once. We come back to it a second time, and then a third, and a fourth, as he lies wide awake. He’s sick, by golly, and this is the note the film must strike! Bill is a wealthy man but also a decent family man. He has two daughters, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who often manages her father’s affairs in the hopes that she will be loved in the same way her younger sister Susan (Claire Forlani) is. Bill and Susan fly into Manhattan together where she works as a doctor. In another plodding scene, Bill gives a monologue about how Susan shouldn’t settle for a guy who only kind of makes her excited. That poor middling guy just so happens to be a Parrish Communications board member, Drew (Jake Weber), who comes to regular family dinner to be with Susan and also wants more power within the company.  Before work, Susan hangs out in a cafe where she meets a man (Brad Pitt) new to the big city who immediately sweeps her off her feet.  So much so that when they part ways, they still keep looking back, always missing each others’ glance. The moment is mined for every morsel of drama even though we’re at a point in the story when we’re not much invested in characters we barely know. It’s a “bad” choice cinematically, you could say. But then there’s the twist of seemingly killing off prime Brad Pitt 20 minutes into movie in almost comedic fashion only for him to be resurrected as Death/Joe Black.  But rather than a spoof of your typical predictable rom com, I’d argue that Meet Joe Black considers itself a more refined version of the romantic genre. I haven’t watched a movie with subtitles all the way through in a long time. But when Death arrives at the Parrish mansion and starts haunting Bill in his library, I could barely make out most of those lines. The basic premise is that Death is here to take sickly Bill but for some reason wants to experience life on Earth for a little. So as long as a well-connected Bill can show him around, the billionaire will be granted a few more days on Earth. Soon, Death, or Joe Black, as he’s called, is following Bill around to family dinners and company boardrooms alike. Susan recognizes his image, but also feels that something is off with this guy. After all, instead of eating a 5 course meal like a normal creature, he prefers even finer dining — a jar of peanut butter and a spoon. Eventually, Susan starts to take a liking to Joe, and in a wild scene, takes his virginity by the pool: “That was like making love with someone making love for the first time,” she swoons. But just like the car accident scene, it’s not anyone who is being portrayed as a neophyte, but Brad Pitt. Another viral moment involves a subplot at Susan’s hospital with an elderly Jamaican woman. She rolls into the hospital with her daughter and immediately is chilled by Joe. To the world’s surprise, Pitt puts on his best Jamaican Patois accent and starts to develop a friendship with this woman, eventually ending her suffering. It is here where the film’s thematic messages shine brightest, though I can’t help but wonder if this entire scenario is yet another Magical Negro trope, with a twist. As a titan of industry, Bill is also trying to get his affairs in order and protect his company and legacy from being swallowed up by a conglomerate. Here, Bill is hoping to avoid another kind of death. And in the final hour, Joe tries to figure out a way to be with Susan while Bill, resigned to his death, wants to protect his daughters and his legacy.  This movie should probably be funnier than it is, but for some reason has a habit of taking itself far too seriously in spots — leading to a lot of unintended comedy, a la that Tommy Wiseau masterpiece. Still, the story of social media rediscovery starts to make you wonder if the very way viewers first come across a film influences our perception and experience of it. Or if a conventional movie trailer still sells a movie better than a patchwork collection of clips on Twitter or TikTok curated by popular demand. Fittingly, a film once left dead in the streets lives on. "

Director Martin Brest took his inspiration for Meet Joe Black from the 1934 film Death Takes A Holiday. That was a comedy, but Brest needed a story that touched on something deeper. Hence, what was originally touted as a rom-com unfolds as a much more sincere drama. Before its release, Meet Joe Black had already been condemned as the most expensive romance ever made (costing over $100 million) and that's for a movie with few special effects. Death may well be a very ordinary character with no obvious special powers. But Parrish, on the other hand, is a millionaire with a millionaire's lifestyle, wardrobe and lavish birthday party to attend. Every detail of his life is perfectly realised on screen (specially designed furniture, ornaments, clothes, etc), and to create a millionaire's lifestyle you evidently have to spend a millionaire's budget. The money, however, isn't the issue: no one minds how much is spent if the end product is fantastic. The issue here is the running time. Meet Joe Black is not bad: it's superbly acted by the three leads, while the relationship between Anthony Hopkins (struggling to deal with the knowledge of his death) and Claire Forlani (who gradually begins to suspect the stranger's motive), is particularly well handled. It looks sumptuous too, bathed in autumn colours as light and life creep into Death's existence. And, to top it off, this morbid love story also has a compelling central storyline, as well as a subplot about the fate of Parrish's media empire. But what it has more than anything else is a bum-numbing three-hour running time. With its epic nature, Titanic got away with it. Meet Joe Black does not. At the beginning, Parrish delivers a long speech about the nature of life and love. His distracted daughter looks at him and says: ""Give it to me again, but the short version."" Someone should have said that to Brest. He could have cut a few speeches. He could have lost a very uncomfortable sex scene between Joe Black and Susan (would they make Death- babies?) He should certainly have sliced out some uneven playing from the support, who seem to think they're in a different kind of movie to the central protagonists. These elements wouldn't have been missed. We could also have gone without Pitt's astonishing Jamaican accent, used for dramatic effect when a Caribbean woman recognises Joe Black for what he is. Not to mention the very unconvincing explanation of how, although he's in one place, he can still kill people all over the world. The audience would have survived. The best bits of Meet Joe Black are contained in the first half-hour and the last, and are worthwhile. The beginning is intriguing, the end tearful, especially as Susan wordlessly begins to realise the fate of her father. To those who have lost a relative recently, these scenes in particular are teary and painful. But they would have had so much more impact without a thumb-twiddling, seat-shifting middle-section. Not bad, just not as good as it could have been had the editor been allowed to hack an hour or so off the running time. Thankfully, however, the classy performances from Pitt, Forlani and Hopkins make Meet Joe Black worthwhile. But only just.

"Oct 26, 2020",positive," A businessman is visited by an otherworldly presence who has the nerve to fall in love with his daughter in this savory, extralong feature (1998), whose obvious plotlines unfold with an almost painful slowness that somehow makes them deeper. The potentially doomed romance between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe (Brad Pitt, achieving the unimaginable with a convincing portrayal of a sexually naive character) is set in a deliberately ironic materialist’s dreamscape—the estate of Susan’s fabulously wealthy father (Anthony Hopkins), who learns to appreciate what’s truly important even as he decides which theatrically decadent dessert to serve at what may be his last birthday party. Martin Brest directed a screenplay by Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade, and Bo Goldman inspired by the 1934 movie Death Takes a Holiday."
"Oct 26, 2020",negative," To call the three-hour-long “Meet Joe Black” leaden would do an injustice to lead. To call it phlegmatic is to dishonor phlegm. To describe it as turgid does a disservice to honest turges everywhere. Only the hardest-core Brad Pitt fans will want to brave this static, deflated entry into the Screen Angels Sweepstakes. If they insist on disregarding the best advice — Don’t go! — then they should at least heed the following: Bring adequate lumbar support and gallons of coffee, not to mention a box of Kleenex. Because rest assured, tears will be jerked. “Meet Joe Black,” which is loosely suggested by the play “Death Takes a Holiday” (later turned into the 1934 movie starring Fredric March), revolves not around Pitt’s character but a business tycoon named Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Parrish spills more money in a day than most people will earn in a lifetime, but he’s just not happy. About to turn 65, he’s nagged by a mysterious pain in his left arm, the onset of which is accompanied by a mysterious voice. Heart attack? Stroke? Worse? Bill doesn’t know, because he doesn’t bother to see a doctor to find out. Which is strange, because one of this daughters, the beautiful Susan (Claire Forlani), is a medical resident who’s constantly hanging around his Manhattan penthouse, taking dips in the pool and wafting around the art-strewn corridors (she isn’t exactly the hardest-working doctor in show business). After endless scenes of helicopter rides and dinners and people talking to each other, the mysterious voice finally makes its identity known and its presence seen. Enter the aggressively blonded Pitt as Death, who arrives not to speed things up but to take a break from all that reaping. A deal is made: As long as Bill can keep him entertained, Death will spare his life, an arrangement that could add entire weeks to the older man’s life. He installs himself at Bill’s side, living at the penthouse, going to the office, sitting in on board meetings and, oh yes, falling in love with the comely Susan, who is a tad confused by this handsome stranger’s behavior. (You can imagine the Cosmo quiz: Your boyfriend is moody and disappears for unexplained periods of time. He’s A) on crack. B) married. C) The angel of death!) Brad Pitt, who really should listen when his mother tells him to get that hair out of his eyes, may well be a very fine actor. But not in “Meet Joe Black,” in which the shaggy heartthrob seems to have researched his role — an odd semaphore of stilted speech, robotic movement and bobbing head — by observing street mimes and dashboard dolls. Still, Pitt cannot be faulted for “Meet Joe Black.” This interminable exercise in non-cinema should be laid at the door of director Martin Brest, who has inexplicably orchestrated the movie as a series of long, dull scenes. We get lots of board meetings and corporate back-stabbing and literate speeches (the words “suborn,” “imprimatur,” “machinations” and “Machiavellian” popped up in a single scene). Indeed, the most visceral moment of “Meet Joe Black” is the shocking sight of a much-loved character being hit by a car and tossed into the air, a scene that should be approached by Pitt’s younger fans with extreme caution. Only an actor of Hopkins’ caliber could wrest a modicum of human feeling from the blurry character he’s been handed, and against all odds he does, lending “Meet Joe Black” an acuity and verve that the movie doesn’t deserve. (Marcia Gay Harden, as his other daughter, has some touching moments, too.)"
"Oct 26, 2020",negative,"I've never encountered such dramatic flatulence, never heard so many pregnant silences that don't deliver, never watched so many close-ups that graze on actors' faces until every last trace of expression has been devoured."
"Oct 26, 2020",negative,Martin Brest's weepie is nicely played but overlong - especially considering the original zipped by in under 80 minutes.
"Oct 26, 2020",negative," 
When the true identity of Peter Cushing is revealed in Dr Terror's House of Horrors, this ordinary-looking passenger in the corner seat of a train compartment is suddenly transformed into the Grim Reaper of popular imagination. The one truly memorable personification of death in a modern setting is the alluring Princess, played by Maria Casares, in Cocteau's Orpheé.
So the opulent Meet Joe Black, in which Brad Pitt impersonates Death, is something of a rarity. It's very loosely based on an Italian play of the Twenties that became a Hollywood film in 1934 as Death Takes a Holiday. In that film, Fredric March as Death disguises himself as a Russian aristocrat and spends three days experiencing life on an Italian nobleman's estate and finding out why he incites such fear. During his absence from duty no one in the world dies. The movie lasted a mere 78 minutes, less than half the length of the remake, which might well have been called Death Takes a Lengthy Sabbatical. 
In Meet Joe Black, the emphasis shifts from the guest to the host, from Death to the multi-millionaire business tycoon Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who, on the eve of his sixty-fifth birthday, has intimations of mortality in the form of internal voices and severe chest pains.
On the way from his Hudson River mansion to his Manhattan office by helicopter, the widowed Bill warns his beloved daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) that she should only marry his right-hand man Drew (Jake Weber) if she really loves him. That morning in a coffee shop near the hospital where she is a doctor, Susan falls in love at first sight with a handsome young man played by Brad Pitt. He's killed in an accident shortly after they part and his body is taken over by Death, who thereupon moves into the Parrish household under the name Joe Black. Joe gives Bill a reprieve until the mammoth sixty-fifth birthday bash his other daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) is organising, but he prevents anyone knowing his true identity.
Films in which people become aware of their impending death normally involve remorse over past sins and attempts to put lives in order. Kurosawa's Living is the classic instance. But, astonishingly for a rich man involved in the media, Bill has conducted himself impeccably. There is not a stain on his private or professional life. In fact, his only remaining task is to preserve the integrity of the communications empire he's created by preventing the duplicitous Drew from merging it with the corporation of an unprincipled rival. Death, in fact, could hardly have found someone better prepared to go into that good night. He thus has more quality time to spend with Susan, who loves him not as Death but as a mysterious stranger.
In The Seventh Seal, the Knight holds Death off by beating him at chess. Anthony Hopkins gains his victory over Brad Pitt by sheer screen presence. This isn't entirely Pitt's fault because the movie's four screenwriters clearly don't know what to make of Death and haven't agreed on what precisely he is or what he's been doing with his time.
From his appearance and behaviour, he's a narcissist, fascinated by his own experiences but little interested in others, apart from Susan and Bill. He's never heard of peanut butter or cookies, yet he can get around Manhattan without a map. He can pass himself off as an Internal Revenue investigator, but has never heard the saying 'Nothing is certain except death and taxes'. He knows he isn't gay, but has to be taught the fundamentals of sex, which suggests he wasn't on duty when Nelson Rockefeller or John Garfield died.
None of this would matter if the director, Martin Brest, hadn't provided so many longueurs in which we might contemplate the film's hollowness and contradictions. One tedious, sentimental, drawn out scene gives way to another and death does seem to be having dominion over us. The flaccid climactic birthday party, for instance, is nearly as long as the ball sequence in Visconti's The Leopard and is the sort of thing that gives hubris a bad name.
The result is that a potentially charming fantasy becomes a grave, funereal work, though I suppose that 'grave' and 'funereal' are the qualities traditionally associated with death.

He knows he isn't gay, but has to be taught the fundamentals of sex, which suggests he wasn't on duty when Nelson Rockefeller or John Garfield died.
None of this would matter if the director, Martin Brest, hadn't provided so many longueurs in which we might contemplate the film's hollowness and contradictions. One tedious, sentimental, drawn out scene gives way to another and death does seem to be having dominion over us. The flaccid climactic birthday party, for instance, is nearly as long as the ball sequence in Visconti's The Leopard and is the sort of thing that gives hubris a bad name.
The result is that a potentially charming fantasy becomes a grave, funereal work, though I suppose that 'grave' and 'funereal' are the qualities traditionally associated with death. 
In The Seventh Seal, the Knight holds Death off by beating him at chess. Anthony Hopkins gains his victory over Brad Pitt by sheer screen presence. This isn't entirely Pitt's fault because the movie's four screenwriters clearly don't know what to make of Death and haven't agreed on what precisely he is or what he's been doing with his time.
From his appearance and behaviour, he's a narcissist, fascinated by his own experiences but little interested in others, apart from Susan and Bill.

	In half the time it takes to ""Meet Joe Black,"" many good films chart an entire life story. By contrast, this thoroughly over-elaborated whimsy dawdles in delineating one man's confrontation with mortality, which presents itself in the person of a handsome young stranger. What might have been an effective fantasy if handled with sophistication and insouciance is instead weighed down by ponderous pacing, overstuffed production values and an instance of miscasting. In half the time it takes to “Meet Joe Black,” many good films chart an entire life story. By contrast, this thoroughly over-elaborated whimsy dawdles in delineating one man’s confrontation with mortality, which presents itself in the person of a handsome young stranger. What might have been an effective fantasy if handled with sophistication and insouciance is instead weighed down by ponderous pacing, overstuffed production values and an instance of miscasting. This first and most expensive of Universal’s four big year-end releases could do some solid midrange business on the basis of Brad Pitt’s name and the public’s seemingly endless appetite for stories relating to angels, intermediaries to the afterlife and so on, no matter how mediocre (“What Dreams May Come”). But whatever B.O. it does cannot possibly match its pretensions. Martin Brest skated on thin ice but got away with it, at least with moviegoers, when he stretched his last film, “Scent of a Woman,” out to 157 minutes. Here, he pushes his luck too far by extending a slim conceit to a full three hours. Rarely has there been a film with so little justification for such a marathon running time; much of the problem stems from the dialogue direction, which often has the actors pausing significantly for many seconds between lines. The uncharitable could make mileage of the issue that the film upon which “Meet Joe Black” is based, Mitchell Leisen’s 1934 Paramount release “Death Takes a Holiday,” ran just 78 minutes, except for the fact that the new picture isn’t a remake in any meaningful sense. Brest, who began mulling the project seriously more than 15 years ago, and his writers have taken just the central premise — of Death assuming human form for a few days to get a taste of what life is like, and falling in love along the way — and spun it in different, much more detailed ways.  No matter the new film’s failings, its inventions can represent only improvements, as the Leisen picture, itself adapted from a 1920s play, now comes off as deadly dull. With his 65th birthday fast approaching, New York media tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) begins hearing a strange, disembodied voice, and shortly suffers a heart seizure while being spoken to so mysteriously. At the same time, his young physician daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), who is halfheartedly involved with her father’s ambitious second-in-command, Drew (Jake Weber), has a memorable chance encounter in a coffee shop with a dashing young man (Brad Pitt) who, immediately after, is hit and killed by speeding cars. In short order, the voice materializes to the mystified William in the guise of the fellow from the coffee shop. In the communications baron’s plush library, the visitor, who goes by the name of Joe Black, informs the older man, a widower whom he has chosen for his exceptional character, that he can buy some time if he will act as his guide to all things earthly. Thus begins a peculiar relationship in which the dazzlingly blond Joe Black follows the powerful William on all his rounds. First stop is a family dinner, where Susan is understandably disconcerted by the presence of the young man who charmed her in the coffee shop, and even more unnerved by the fact that he doesn’t behave as though he were the same guy. William’s other daughter, the too-eager-to-please Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), her affable but none-too-bright husband, Quince (Jeffrey Tambor), and Drew are also curious about the newcomer. Joe’s presence induces some polite raised eyebrows among the members of William’s corporate board, which the next day convenes to consider a mega-merger that the principled William refuses to endorse. The underhanded Drew, who has been in cahoots with the other company all along, then sets in motion an elaborate scheme by which he forces William into instant early retirement, a process spurred by the fact that the boss has privately stated that all important matters are now “up to Joe,” a man whose presence and identity no one understands. It doesn’t help that Joe walks and talks rather like a zombie, and that he prefers peanut butter to any other food. But Susan, for one, is willing to overlook all this in her determination to figure out who the mystery man is, and sure enough maneuvers him into her arms. In line with what the young man in the coffee shop hoped for from the beginning, they fall for each other quickly and deeply, to the great consternation of William; in an instance in which father truly does know best, he demands that his daughter, whom he had earlier told to become “swept away” by love, steer clear of Joe. After wrestling with his impending fate and coming to accept it, William tells his otherworldly emissary that he’s ready to go, to which Joe replies, “Good. After the party.” This is a cue for the final act, a black-tie birthday bash staged on the vast grounds of William’s stupendous waterfront estate. Encompassing 45 minutes of screen time, the elegant blowout provides the setting for neat resolutions of all of the film’s important narrative and thematic strands, all capped off by a gigantic fireworks display. By taking so much time and building to the climax so methodically, Brest seems to be trying to pull off a metaphysical slow burn, one whose cumulative impact will prove moving and profound. But even if one buys the premise, the story is finally just too contrived and wispy to support heavy emotional investment. The heart of the film can be found in Hopkins’ William Parrish, a dynamic man who has been chosen by Death for observation as the best humanity has to offer. As Hopkins plays him, with tremendous verve and sympathy, he is all this, but the character also seems impossibly idealized, truly without flaws. Never is there an indication of the ruthlessness that must have been required to get as far as he did. He is even the perfect widower, forever living in the memory of his adored wife, without a woman to replace her. By contrast, Pitt’s Joe Black is an odd egg indeed. At times Joe looks as though he hasn’t a clue what to do or say in polite company, while at others he appropriately appears to be several steps ahead of everybody else. Looking dashing and slightly impish at times, Pitt isn’t particularly effective in the moments he must carry the screen alone or in his attempts at physical comedy. He’s better in the romantic interludes, in which Joe experiences love and sex for the first time, and best of all in his scenes with Hopkins, suggesting that he would excel in ensemble pieces cast opposite strong actors, rather than toplined alone. Forlani makes a decidedly limited impression as the rich man’s daughter who has never before been swept away by love. In the first coffee shop scene, her character says and does nothing to make any impression on the young man, who is impressed anyway, and the tentative manner and skittish eye contact with which the actress endows Susan become tiresome. Weber starts quietly and eventually commands singular attention as Parrish’s treacherous would-be successor and son-in-law, while Harden and Tambor more gently score in lightly comic support. Luxuriously upholstered pic so thoroughly expresses the world of its wealthy characters that the money all but drips from the screen. If one had unlimited resources, one might certainly want to engage production designer Dante Ferretti and costume designers Aude Bronson-Howard and David C. Robinson to create one’s personal ambience, with the help of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki to make sure everything was lit to maximum effectiveness. Thomas Newman’s score is quite beautiful, particularly in its main theme, which possesses a ghostly echo of his father, Alfred Newman’s, exquisite title music for “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”"
"Mar 11, 2008",positive," One of the unwanted gifts of the impending millennium is the new metaphysics-lite subgenre. These movies usually involve good people — no, make that downright noble people — who go on some awe-inspiring spiritual journey, nudged along by lots of pieties and string music. Contact, City of Angels and What Dreams May Come are prime examples. The point of these films always seems to be that the universe is kind, God is smiling above us and within us, blah blah blah. Meet Joe Black is far and away the best of this current crop, and not just because it skimps on the life-lesson speeches. (Anthony Hopkins, summing up the film in a Today Show interview, spouted more pieties than can be found in the entire three-hour movie.) This isn’t a great film, but it’s an excellent piece of work — hushed, deliberate, surprisingly level-headed and intimate. The director, Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman), takes his time and lets tension and meaning gather in the long spaces between lines of dialogue. The 178-minute length makes sense: The movie unfolds during the final days of a man who has to learn to let go of his life. Bill Parrish (Hopkins), an extravagantly rich businessman, has been plagued by alarming fatigue and chest pains. He suspects that death is near, and, sure enough, Death is waiting for Bill in his library — in the form of Brad Pitt. Death, who soon assumes the name Joe Black, has occupied a human body and wishes to experience life on this mortal coil before he takes Bill into the undiscover’d country. This idea has been around before, of course — in 1934’s Death Takes a Holiday and its many permutations since. And the selling point now, as then, is the romance between Joe and Susan (Claire Forlani), the younger of Bill’s two daughters. As a doomed storybook love, this beats Titanic all to hell: Hey, guy, you’re Death — you can’t be messing around with mortals, even if they do look like Claire Forlani. Surprisingly, though, the script (credited to Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade, and Bo Goldman) treats the romance as a plot point among equals. Much of the film’s emphasis is not on Joe Black but on Bill, who knows he doesn’t have much longer to live and is trying to put things in order. More important, he learns, is to put things in perspective. Anthony Hopkins does a beautifully subtle job of showing us the growing tension between Bill’s not wanting to leave his loving daughters (his eldest, who’s throwing herself into planning his 65th birthday party, is played by the warm and appealing Marcia Gay Harden) and his wanting to make sure there’s no unresolved business. The character is a bit idealized — your basic dream boss — but Hopkins burrows inside the man’s fear, anger, and resignation. Brest’s Scent of a Woman had that completely needless subplot about Chris O’Donnell getting in trouble for a prank, and some will say that Brest is at it again in Meet Joe Black: There are maybe three scenes too many involving the machinations of Bill’s devious right-hand man Drew (Jake Weber, who nonetheless brings dry wit to a thankless role). And Thomas Newman’s score gets a bit too loud and effusive near the end, screaming “Cry!” (To be frank, I didn’t need musical encouragement. When Susan delivered her line about her father, I admit I was a goner.) Judging by her winning performance here, I’d guess Claire Forlani is about to become very hot, and deservedly so; Brad Pitt, too, makes up for his dullness in The Devil’s Own and Seven Years in Tibet. Sometimes he’s funny (as when Joe discovers the joys of peanut butter), sometimes a little frightening. What’s more, Meet Joe Black contains one of the more startling images I’ve ever seen in a movie — the opening-night audience buzzed about it for a full minute.¹ (You’ll know it when you see it.) Overall, the movie is full of surprises: Long but never boring, spiritual but never soggy, this is the brand of big entertainment Hollywood is best at but so rarely does right these days. ¹There was also laughter, as I recall, and indeed that ragdoll-physics moment — right, you know the scene — became how the movie was known best, and derisively so. Which is unfair. It’s a good film. Martin Brest is a good director. Okay, so the now-famous trailer for Star Wars Episode I – The Phantom Menace (which was shown in front of Meet Joe Black, among several others) has finally been unveiled. What is there to say about it? The fans are loving it, and there’s no question that it’s a brilliant job of marketing. The trailer will be analyzed and deconstructed for months to come, poked and prodded for the secrets it may dislodge upon the twentieth or thirtieth viewing. All of this, to an unbeliever like myself, is a gigantic sick joke. The movie, when it comes, will undoubtedly be a trailer itself — a shiny advertisement for a fresh line of Star Wars toys, and the first chapter in yet another trilogy. The presence of a young Anakin Skywalker and a goofy alien sidekick suggests that George Lucas is courting the next generation — the children of his original fish, which he landed back in 1977. Can Star Wars be blamed for the current wretched state of American movies? Not entirely, but Lucas hasn’t done much to help, either, to put it kindly. The new Star Wars films will be good for 20th Century-Fox, exhibitors, toy manufacturers, and whatever other companies are in bed with Lucasfilm to produce Star Wars junk; the films will move some currency around. But I don’t think I will be called cynical if I predict that very little of the riches will be pumped back into independent film. The massive anticipation for The Phantom Menace — hell, the massive anticipation for its trailer — reveals America at its arrested-development worst. Big-budget spectacle has its place, but if that becomes the only genre welcomed in the marketplace — and we’re getting perilously near that point — then it’s all over."

Rated PG-13 - Running time: 3:00 - Released 11/13/98
The story of Meet Joe Black, penned by Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno and
based on the 1934 classic Death Takes A Holiday, is not epic in any
way. The cast is basically made up of 6 people, the action takes place within
a 2-week period set in the present, and apart from the final half hour,
there are really no major visuals. But like Robert Redford's The Horse Whisperer, Meet Joe Black
is cursed with a self-indulgent director who doesn't know how to cut. There
is absolutely no reason for it to be three hours long.
 Martin Brest, who has directed several excellent films in the past [Beverly
Hills Cop (1984), Scent of a Woman (1992)], must have misplaced
his scissors, but the length of his film is not its only fault. Excellent
performances by Anthony Hopkins and Clair Forlani are foiled by a rather
style-less job by Brad Pitt, and Jake Weber's stereotyped villain is not
human enough to believe.
 When Death (Pitt) comes to collect his latest package, newspaper CEO
Bill Parrish (Hopkins), he decides to hang around awhile and sample some
of the earthly pleasures he's heard so much about. Choosing a plain tan
suit over the usual scythe and black cloak, he steals some guy's body and
adopts the moniker ""Joe Black."" He chose Parrish as his guide
because of his leadership qualities, but he didn't realize he also had a
daughter who is both beautiful (in a big-nosed, Barbra Streisand sort of
way) and intelligent. Susan (Forlani) is a doctor-in-residence at the local
hospital. Bill also has another daughter, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who
is busy planning a spectacular party for her dad's 65th birthday. Allison's
affable husband Quince (Jeffrey Tambor) and Susan's fiancé Drew (Weber)
are both on the board of directors for Bill's multimillion-dollar company,
and Drew, a cutthroat businessman, is Bill's closest aide.
 But the sudden appearance of Joe Black takes everyone by surprise, especially
Susan, who had just met the body's former owner that morning at a coffee
shop. She had been charmed by the mystery man's polite candor about love
and commitment, and felt romantic pangs that emphasized her dissatisfaction
with Drew. Joe has no recollection of the coffee shop meeting, of course,
but is intrigued nonetheless. Drew first welcomes Joe as a friend of Bill's,
but soon grows irritated by Joe's apparent influence on his boss and girlfriend.
But what really ticks him off is when Bill suddenly cancels Drew's plans
to merge the company with another, larger corporation. Thinking Bill has
surrendered control of the business to this mysterious visitor, he engineers
a hostile takeover, using the unwitting Quince as a tool.
 Meanwhile, Joe is basically just enjoying all the enjoyable aspects of
being human, from eating peanut butter to making love. The one he's making
love to is, of course, Susan, who has fallen completely head over heels
for a man who must leave Earth in just a few days.

"Aug 21, 2002",negative," For millions of people, a close encounter with death has enabled them to see with fresh eyes the beauty and bounty of life. In this fantasy film directed by Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman), the process is reversed. Several members of a fabulously rich family teach death about the pleasures of the flesh and the transports of love. So far, so good. The problem is: this light parabolic vehicle is weighed down by a tediously slow pace and overwrought production values. Even so, its simple message is worth taking to heart. Brought to his knees by a heart seizure, New York media tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) hears death calling him. While one daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) is busy planning an elaborate celebration for his 65th birthday, his favorite daughter Susan (Claire Forlani), a physician, is being romanced by a handsome and charming stranger (Brad Pitt) in a coffee shop. When he is hit and killed by two cars, the Grim Reaper takes over his body and asks Parrish to serve as his tour guide in the land of the living. Adopting the name Joe Black, Death becomes addicted to peanut butter and eventually falls in love with Susan. In addition, he helps Parrish fend off the efforts of Drew (Jake Weber), his right-hand man, to sell off his company to a corporate raider. In one of the opening scenes of the film, Parrish tells his daughter that he hopes she will find a lover who will enable her ""to sing with rapture and to dance like a dervish."" He wants her to be deliriously happy. That simple message about the spiritual firepower of love is what we are left with at the end of Meet Joe Black. Too bad it wasn't delivered in a more simple and lean package."

"Jan 1, 2001",neutral," November 29, 1998 -- ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie that just never seems to go anywhere and it never seems to end and all of its characters seem to be asleep. This story is not lively and it is not fast-paced. Some plants grow faster than this story develops. 
The story is a modern retelling of the old ""Death Takes a Holiday"" film made in 1934, but it is about three times as long as that one was. Death, in the person of megastar Brad Pitt, decides to take human form to see what it is like on the other side of the veil. He persuades multimillionaire William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) to show him around in return for a few extra days of life. 
Parrish doesn't want to be bothered with being a tour guide, so death takes up with his pretty young daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani of ""The Rock,"" ""Basquiat"" and ""Mallrats""). Parrish doesn't like that, either (he doesn't seem to like much of anything. You would think Death would have picked someone more upbeat for a guide). 
Parrish and Death have harsh words. You would think that Death would always have the last word, but not this time. Pitt gives a very low-key performance as Death, a guy who knows the IRS code by heart, knows how to speak with a Jamaican accent, but knows nothing about peanut butter. 
There are some fine actors in the film in addition to Pitt, Hopkins and Forlani, there's a sparkling performance by Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Allison, Parrish's older daughter who lost the sibling rivalry war (she appeared in ""Flubber, ""Desperate measures"") to her sister Susan. The relationship between Allison and her father is about the only believable one in the film. Harden brings a little energy to her role, and that's about the only energy in the film. 
Jeffrey Tambor plays Allison's lovable looser husband, Quince. The actors try hard, but they just can't pump enough life into this over bloated, somnambulant movie to keep it moving ahead. As Woody Allen said in ""Annie Hall,"" ""What I think we've got here is a dead shark."" This film rates a C-."

"Jan 1, 2000",positive," A loose retelling of 1934's Death Takes a Holiday, this updated version adapts a fuller, firmer attitude toward other-worldly romance as well as a near-three-hour running time. With Hopkins onscreen for much of it, it's not as dreary as you'd expect, and even the angelic Pitt, as an anthropomorphized, blonde-banged Death, is surprisingly tolerable in an admittedly difficult role that could have just as easily descended into unwitting farce. Brest (Scent of a Woman) opens the film with a sequence in which Susan Parrish (Forlani) -- young, M.D. daughter of Hopkins' wealthy media magnate William Parrish -- runs into a nameless but utterly charming young man (Pitt) in a New York coffee shop. During the course of a five-minute flirtation the spark arcs, and the two near-strangers part, never to meet again. As it happens, the handsome stranger is struck by a car and killed moments later. As luck, or fate, or, more accurately Death should have it, the stranger is reborn, after a fashion, as Death itself appears at the Parrish family mansion wearing the stranger's flesh. He's here to take the senior Parrish off to the great beyond, but before he does, he'd like to find out a bit about the living. “You will be my tour guide,” he tells an understandably stunned Hopkins, and before long Death, under the moniker of Joe Black, is attending Parrish Communications board meetings, wrapping his tongue around gob after gob of peanut butter (a delicacy, we are led to believe, absent from the netherworld), and falling in love with daughter Susan. At first it's difficult to understand why anyone would need three hours to tell this pleasant fable, but to his credit, Brest fleshes out the film with a subplot involving a corporate takeover (unnecessary but absorbing nonetheless) and assorted other tricks; Meet Joe Black flows nicely, and the whole of the film is bathed in some of the most sumptuous cinematography (courtesy of Like Water for Chocolate's Emmanuel Lubezki) of the year. The film, however, belongs to Hopkins, pure and simple. He commands your eye when he is onscreen, and when he's off you're subconsciously waiting for him to reappear. As the noble media baron and devoted family man, he's stuck with lines that would surely crumple in any other actor's mouth but here manages to make them sound good, even great, by sheer virtue of his being Sir Anthony Hopkins. Pitt is in a realm that approximates his lunatic role in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys, but toned down considerably. His Death is an egocentric spirit engaged in learning a smidgen of humility (and humanity), and though the role frequently borders on the comic, it rarely sloshes over into the absurd. Only once (when Death, his facial muscles lost in the act of making love) did the males in the packed screening audience audibly squirm (which perhaps says more about the males than Pitt's acting). Too often derided as a vacuous pretty boy, Pitt brings a wan, insouciant charm to the Grim Reaper, while Hopkins, as ever, anchors everything around him. It's an elegiac love story from beyond the grave, as appealingly simple as it is emotionally complex.

Pig in the City, as its title suggests, brings the sheepherding pig to an unnamed metropolis (inventively designed as an amalgam of New York, Sydney, Paris, San Francisco, among many others) to save the farm after inadvertently causing his beloved master, Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell) to suffer a crippling accident.  As upsetting as the sight of some heavy machinery falling on the gentle farmer is, it's not quite as upsetting as a ridiculously drawn-out scene of a dog's near-drowning, not to mention an already-crippled dog being thrown from a speeding car, his spirit then briefly seen frolicking in a canine heaven.   The children in the audience with which I saw the film were audibly upset, as were some parents, and I cannot blame them.
What nearly redeems the film is the enduring charm of the pig, this time voiced by E.G. Daily (taking over for Christine Cavanaugh); the imaginative production design; and the impressive effects work.  As in the original, it is impossible to distinguish the real animals from the animatronic ones to the computer animated ones.  And as in the original, everything does work out nicely for the pig, who learns a lesson or two about life.  But walking out of this Babe, I--and I am sure many others--feel that Universal should have left well enough alone, heeding the immortal closing words of Farmer Hoggett in the original (repeated in this film): ""That'll do, Pig.""

However, I didn't see or hear anything particularly insightful except for the line of dialogue, ""You can learn a lot about a society by who it chooses to celebrate.""  And what exactly do we learn about our society from Celebrity?  That it is one where just about every celebrity is willing to appear in a Woody Allen film--hence another star-studded ensemble, which also includes Joe Mantegna, Famke Janssen, Bebe Neuwirth, and Winona Ryder, who displays nice chemistry with Branagh (whose dead-on Allen impression didn't annoy me).  Without any clear ideas or a strong story, Celebrity ends up as a showcase of fine character work by stars--a celebration of celebrity that I don't think Allen intended. 
Instead, Abramson and Bernstein cast their focus (using that term very loosely) on two separate groups of people who are tapped to appear on Jerry for different topics, only to end up intertwining.  Receiving the most screen time are a mother-daughter pair of trailer park trollops.  The daughter (Jaime Pressly), who indiscriminately has (to use the President's euphemism) ""inappropriate relationships"" with random guests at the hotel she works at, is sleeping with her stepfather (Michael Dudikoff of American Ninja, er, fame).  In retaliation, the mother (Molly Hagan) starts having her daughter's fiancé (Ashley Holbrook).  Slightly more amusing is the other group, a trio of ghetto stereotype girls (Wendy Raquel Robinson, Tangie Ambrose, and Nicki Micheaux) who have all, at one point or another, fallen into the bed of musclebound studmuffin Demond (charismatic Spawn and Tyson star Michael Jai White, who can certainly find better work than this).
What ensues is tons of ""too hot for TV"" tawdriness that, ironically, enough, is not compulsively watchable as Springer's two Too Hot for TV! videos--nor nowhere nearly as funny.  Part of the reason is that we are acutely aware that all the outrageousness is staged; regardless of whether or not any of Springer's TV guests' tussles are rehearsed, those fights do feature nonprofessionals inflicting real harm on each other--which is part of the show's sadistic guilty pleasure factor.  But the main reason is the amateurish sloppiness of the entire movie, from the acting to the countless glitches in logic and continuity.  (For example, Springer's character's last name, according to the credits, is ""Farrelly,"" but in one autograph-signing scene, he signs his last name as ""Springer."")

Don't be fooled by Warner Bros.'s misleading marketing campaign, which
sells this strange film as a light-as-a-feather romance.  At the center of Home Fries is Henry Lever (Chris Ellis), whose upright dead body is found in the middle of a field.   Henry, who had a heart ailment, was quite literally scared to death by his two National Guard helicopter pilot stepsons Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus (Jake Busey), who chase him down with a chopper as a favor to their unhappy mother (Catherine O'Hara).  Since it all happened in the middle of nowhere, there are no witnesses--at least by eye.  Possibly overhearing everything, thanks to some crossed radio signals, is Sally (Drew Barrymore), a very pregnant young woman who works the drive-thru at a local burger joint.  And, as it always conveniently happens in the movies, the father of Sally's baby is the late Henry.
To get close to Sally and find out what she may or may not know, Dorian
takes a job at Burger-Matic himself.  But he gets more than he bargained for, slowly but surely falling for her.  Home Fries could have worked if writer Vince Gilligan and director Dean Parisot kept things simple and left the film at that.  But real-life loves Wilson and the always-engaging Barrymore aren't given much breathing room to build an on-screen rapport; they're all but drowned out by all the strange goings-on that compete for attention.  Lurking in the background and occasionally stepping up to center stage is the conniving Mrs. Lever, who has a Machiavellian grasp on Angus, who will do anything he can to make his mother happy--even kill.  Gilligan obviously intended this subplot to give the film an unconventional, dark edge, but it is largely unfunny, too broadly played, and too much of what springs from it feels out of place.  Does there really need to be a go-for-broke copter-car chase climax?
While I applaud the filmmakers' ambitions in creating something different, I cannot help but feel that Home Fries would have been better if it were more conventional.  Ironically, despite all the quirkiness being bandied about, it is the film's most conventional aspect--the romance--that remotely holds any interest.  Everything else, as offbeat as it is, is simply a bore.

As amusing as Hackman and his riff on his character in The Conversation is, it is with his first appearance (which doesn't come until about an hour in, if not more) that Enemy of the State's tightly coiled tension begins to unravel somewhat; there is much more suspense when Dean, a common man with no combat skills or the like, is called on to evade government professionals solely on his wits.  But on the whole, David Marconi's script is solid, intelligently bringing up realistic issues regarding privacy while serving the slam-bang thrills required of any Jerry Bruckheimer production.  Pulling the entire enterprise together is Scott, who uses his
large bag of dazzling visual tricks in good service to the plot; and Smith.  He paints a vivid portrait of paranoia and fear, and his natural presence and rapport with the audience is invaluable in creating a likable character. 
The similarities between Bugs and Antz begin and end with the facts
that they are completely computer animated, center on ant colonies, and
that the two main characters are a worker ant (here named Flik, voiced by Dave Foley) and an ant princess (Atta, voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus).  Ne'er-do-well Flik is ordered by the Princess to find warrior insects to help his colony in their ongoing conflict with a gang of grasshoppers led by the maniacal Hopper (Kevin Spacey).  Flik finds a willing group in the praying mantis Manny (Jonathan Harris); his moth wife, Gypsy (Madeline Kahn); male ladybug Francis (Denis Leary); walking stick Slim (David Hyde Pierce); caterpillar Heimlich (Joe Ranft); black widow spider Rosie (Bonnie Hunt); rhino beetle Dim (Brad Garrett); and pillbugs Tuck and Roll (Michael McShane).  But as warrior-like as these bugs may appear, they are actually gentle circus performers desperate for a gig after being fired by flea circus owner P.T. Flea (John Ratzenberger).  Realizing his error, Flik nonetheless tries to make a counteroffensive against the grasshoppers work, lest he let down the colony once again.
The script for A Bug's Life, credited to co-director Andrew Stanton, Donald McEnery, and Bob Shaw (from a story by Stanton, Ranft, and co-director John Lasseter), lacks the sharp, satirical, sociopolitical subtext of Antz.  For that matter, neither is the story as hilarious and smart as that of the previous Disney/Pixar collaboration, Toy Story.  In telling a simpler story, Bugs holds more kid and general family appeal, but that does not mean that there isn't enough witty dialogue, funny situations, and entertaining characters to amuse the adults in the crowd.  (In fact, the film's best gag, which comes during the end credits, is
clearly aimed at adults; I wouldn't dream of giving it away, but I will say that, with any luck, it should kill a lazy trend in recent film.)  The most memorable characters are distinguished by terrific voice performances: Spacey completely inhabits the menacing Hopper with malicious glee; Louis-Dreyfus is nicely neurotic as Atta; and Ranft fits Heimlich with a hilarious, almost effeminate German accent.  As a whole, though, the ensemble here won't make you forget the work of the more stellar cast of Antz; Foley does an adequate job voicing Flik, but, not surprisingly, he
doesn't hold down the center of the movie as well as Woody Allen in the
other film.
Where A Bug's Life is clearly superior to Antz is in the visual department.  The art by the Pixar crew is stunningly detailed, from the gritty walls of the ant colony tunnels to, most impressively, the insects themselves, namely the amazingly lifelike grasshoppers.  Lasseter and
Stanton also employ more ambitious camera work than their DreamWorks
counterparts, especially during an exciting aerial chase sequence set
during a rainstorm.  PDI did a terrific job with the animation on Antz, but A Bug's Life shows that Pixar is still the king of feature computer animation.
And, by default, so is Disney, and, with its broader demographic appeal, A Bug's Life should handily outpace Antz's impressive box office
grosses.  But DreamWorks has already established itself as a worthy
contender in the animation field, and the Mouse should watch out when the big SKG fires its next assault, next month's hotly anticipated epic
The Prince of Egypt.

Although his filmmaking career has spanned twenty years, Sam Raimi has
always remained on the fringes of Hollywood, scoring no big box office hits but amassing a fiercely devoted cult following and with his trademark brand of dark humor (more often than not tinged with gore) and wildly kinetic camera work.  More than a few Raimi cultists weaned on the likes of his Evil Dead trilogy will undoubtedly cry ""sellout"" after seeing A Simple Plan, which neither looks nor feels like a traditional Raimi film.  Instead, it looks and feels like  a simply ""traditional"" film: no flashy camera work, no excessive violence, no macabre humor.
Thematically, on the other hand, this adaptation of Scott B. Smith's
bestselling novel is exactly what one would expect from the auteur.  Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton play Midwestern brothers Hank and Jacob Mitchell, who, with friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), discover a downed plane containing a dead body and a bag full of money--$4.4 million, to be exact.  Their plan, as the title states, is simple: split the money between them, but only after the plane is discovered and it is determined that the authorities are not tracing the cash.
As they say, ""the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry,"" and
that's exactly what happens.  As jealousy, greed, and suspicion enter the picture, a tense and ever-twisting turn of events follows, in which the most innocent characters reveal their more sinister tendencies--and vice versa.  This theme of the ever-shifting tides of evil within people is a perfect fit for the dark sensibilities of Raimi, and he made a wise decision in keeping his showy visual tendencies in check.  Any of Raimi's usual visual theatrics would have detracted from Smith's tightly-wound script, and his restrained approach intensifies the suspense of the story.
Adding to the complexity and power of the story are the actors, whose
multidimensional performances create complex characters the audience
sometimes hates yet maintains a certain empathy for.  Thornton is likely to receive the most attention for his heartwrenching turn as the sad sack Jacob, who may be slow-witted but is nobody's fool.  Equally as impressive though certain to be overlooked in Thornton's shadow is Paxton's subtle, slow burn as the often-conflicted Hank.  Bridget Fonda's role as Hank's wife Sarah seems simple at the start, but as the character gradually takes on sharper edges, so does Fonda's performance.  The film's richness of character lends its  conclusion a poignant and haunting impact.
As badly as the characters in A Simple Plan behave, nothing they do comes off quite as reprehensible as the deeds perpetrated by the characters inhabiting Very Bad Things, the audacious writing/directing debut of actor Peter Berg.  Stuffed with scenes of stylishly shot splatter, this film is as violent as any that has been released as this or any year--and it's all played for laughs (coincidentally, much like Raimi's earlier work).  That shameless, eager-to-shock energy, with a crafty script and a flawless ensemble cast to match, make this beyond-black comedy a very good thing indeed. 
A few days before his wedding to Laura Garrity (Cameron Diaz), Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) heads to Las Vegas for a big bachelor blowout with his buddies: self-improvement-obsessed realtor Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), quiet auto mechanic Charles Moore (Leland Orser), straightlaced family man Adam Berkow (Daniel Stern), and Adam's boorish younger brother Michael (Jeremy Piven).  Mix these five men, gallons of booze, pounds of cocaine and marijuana, and a stripper into a hotel room and something bad is bound to happen--and it does.  A rather grisly ""complication"" during sex with Michael leaves the stripper dead, and the ever-cunning Boyd comes up with, yes, a simple plan to correct, as he calls it, the ""105-pound problem""--bury her body in the desert.
Predictably, this rash decision just leads to more trouble.  What isn't so predictable, however, is the severity of the troubling situations Berg puts his characters in.  These developments will undoubtedly offend some, but most people would be laughing too hard to be offended.  An obvious comparison would be to the Farrelly Brothers' surprise sensation There's Something About Mary, but the brands of humor are distinctly different; whereas the Farrellys dabbled in ""gross-out"" bodily function humor, Berg's violent variety of comedy can best be described as ""shock"" humor.  But however different their specific sensibilities are, the Farrellys and Berg share the same go-for-broke attitude when it comes to generating laughs, going so far as to seem to dare the audience not to laugh.  ""Shock"" gags would not mean anything if they didn't organically emerge from the story, and like Mary, the very bad things of the title are firmly rooted in the script.
But there's more to Berg's assured writing than his ability to jolt the
audience into laughter; there are also some juicy roles, and each cast
member tackles their respective job with aplomb.  The characters truly take shape, and the actors achieve liftoff, after the stripper incident, when everyone experiences different types of emotional fallout.  The fact that Kyle's increasing anxiety can be palpably felt while not exactly seen is a tribute to Favreau's firm grasp of the character, who tries to maintain a veneer of composure throughout.  Adam becomes mad with paranoia, leading to some effectively hammy hysterics by Stern.  Nicely playing off of him is Piven, whose all-attitude Michael undergoes the most dramatic arc in the film.  Slater's often irksome Nicholson-channelling works like a charm for
Boyd.   As his self-improvement philosophy becomes increasingly, shall we say, dark, Slater's devilish Jack-like grin and swagger could not be more perfect; it's his best performance since True Romance.  As the wedding
date nears and the tension mounts, the chirpy Laura seems less like
herself--or is that more?--and Diaz obviously has a blast.  Even a relatively peripheral player like Adam's wife Lois (Jeanne Tripplehorn) takes on greater depth as things get more and more horrifying; only Orser's barely-heard Moore remains an enigma, but I believe that was the point.  Berg falls a little short at the end; his ultimate resolution doesn't quite live up to the raucous build up, but it closes the film with an appropriately acidic sting.

The fact that Kyle's increasing anxiety can be palpably felt while not exactly seen is a tribute to Favreau's firm grasp of the character, who tries to maintain a veneer of composure throughout.

Slater's often irksome Nicholson-channelling works like a charm for
Boyd.   As his self-improvement philosophy becomes increasingly, shall we say, dark, Slater's devilish Jack-like grin and swagger could not be more perfect; it's his best performance since True Romance.  As the wedding
date nears and the tension mounts, the chirpy Laura seems less like
herself--or is that more?--and Diaz obviously has a blast.  Even a relatively peripheral player like Adam's wife Lois (Jeanne Tripplehorn) takes on greater depth as things get more and more horrifying; only Orser's barely-heard Moore remains an enigma, but I believe that was the point.  Berg falls a little short at the end; his ultimate resolution doesn't quite live up to the raucous build up, but it closes the film with an appropriately acidic sting. 
As badly as the characters in A Simple Plan behave, nothing they do comes off quite as reprehensible as the deeds perpetrated by the characters inhabiting Very Bad Things, the audacious writing/directing debut of actor Peter Berg.  Stuffed with scenes of stylishly shot splatter, this film is as violent as any that has been released as this or any year--and it's all played for laughs (coincidentally, much like Raimi's earlier work).  That shameless, eager-to-shock energy, with a crafty script and a flawless ensemble cast to match, make this beyond-black comedy a very good thing indeed. 
A few days before his wedding to Laura Garrity (Cameron Diaz), Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) heads to Las Vegas for a big bachelor blowout with his buddies: self-improvement-obsessed realtor Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), quiet auto mechanic Charles Moore (Leland Orser), straightlaced family man Adam Berkow (Daniel Stern), and Adam's boorish younger brother Michael (Jeremy Piven).  Mix these five men, gallons of booze, pounds of cocaine and marijuana, and a stripper into a hotel room and something bad is bound to happen--and it does.  A rather grisly ""complication"" during sex with Michael leaves the stripper dead, and the ever-cunning Boyd comes up with, yes, a simple plan to correct, as he calls it, the ""105-pound problem""--bury her body in the desert.
Predictably, this rash decision just leads to more trouble.  What isn't so predictable, however, is the severity of the troubling situations Berg puts his characters in.  These developments will undoubtedly offend some, but most people would be laughing too hard to be offended.  An obvious comparison would be to the Farrelly Brothers' surprise sensation There's Something About Mary, but the brands of humor are distinctly different; whereas the Farrellys dabbled in ""gross-out"" bodily function humor, Berg's violent variety of comedy can best be described as ""shock"" humor.  But however different their specific sensibilities are, the Farrellys and Berg share the same go-for-broke attitude when it comes to generating laughs, going so far as to seem to dare the audience not to laugh.  ""Shock"" gags would not mean anything if they didn't organically emerge from the story, and like Mary, the very bad things of the title are firmly rooted in the script.
But there's more to Berg's assured writing than his ability to jolt the
audience into laughter; there are also some juicy roles, and each cast
member tackles their respective job with aplomb.

That's exactly what director Mitchell Leisen did in 1934's 79-minute Death Takes a Holiday, upon which Martin Brest's film is based.
Despite the presence of the Grim Reaper himself, Joe Black is a simple and frothy fantasy that does not deserve such an epic length.  Death, who has arrived on earth to take an aging business tycoon (Anthony Hopkins) by the name of Bill Parrish (Get it?  Parrish?) into the great beyond, decides to take a holiday in the land of the living in the body of a recently deceased young man (Brad Pitt).  Death gets more than he bargained for when he falls in love with Bill's unhappy youngest daughter Susan (Claire Forlani).
An drab corporate intrigue subplot contributes to the bloated running
time, as does the tediously drawn out finale, which strings together a
number of potential endings of diminishing effectiveness; had the film
ended fifteen minutes earlier, it would have been better for it.
Nonetheless, the length does not completely dilute the involving core of the story, whose effectiveness can be credited to the ever-impressive Hopkins and the luminous Forlani, whose heartfelt performance is as stunning as her appearance.  Not surprisingly, the weak link in the lead trio of actors is Pitt, whose portrayal of Death comes off as a cleaned-up version of his blank stoner character in True Romance.

I echo Ebert's sentiments, but from a different angle.  There is a lot of violence, sex, and various other forms of bad behavior on display in first time writer-director Skip Woods's low-budget thriller.  But the graphic nature of Thursday is not what upset me; it was the content behind the mayhem--or, rather, the lack thereof.  There's absolutely no substance to Woods's script beyond the setup: a ""reformed"" ex-drug dealer (Thomas Jane) who has his quiet Houston household violently thrown upside down after his still-in-the-biz ex-partner (Aaron Eckhart, who should have known better) arrives for a stay.  What follows are random, plotless acts of violence and
nastiness, such as various bloody shooting deaths; grisly body disposals; and, most notoriously, an Amazonian femme fatale (Paulina Porizkova) wearing a jacket reading ""CUNT"" who openly masturbates and later rapes the main character.  This criticism may sound hypocritical from someone who completely bought into the sick sensibility of Very Bad Things, but there writer-director Peter Berg had an actual story to work with, and the borderline offensive shocks naturally emerged from that narrative.  Woods, on the other hand, hails from the school of film that believes that shock value in and of itself equals hipness.  In actuality, it only equates to pathetic desperation. 
My experience with Nickelodeon's smash cartoon series Rugrats has been confined to just an episode or two caught during breaks from channel surfing.  But as limited as my familiarity with the show is, I have seen enough of it to know that it's not something strictly for the tykes, despite of its title's implication.  While clearly targeted at the preschool demographic, the adventures of diaper-clad Tommy Pickles (voice of E.G. Daily) and his friends Chuckie Finster (Christine Cavanaugh) and twin siblings Phillip and Lillian Deville (both voiced by Kath Soucie) show mature flashes of wit, and that smartness extends to the film.  Only adults will appreciate such wry touches as a hospital sign tracking the arrivals of newborns like flights at an airport, references to The Fugitive and A Cry in the Dark, and the children's numerous instances of malapropism (e.g. ""custardy"" for ""custody"").
The majority of the film, on the other hand, is equally accessible and amusing to grown-ups and wee ones alike.  As can be expected, there is only a sliver of a story in David N. Weiss and J. David Stem's script.  At center of the plot is the arrival of a new child in the Pickles household, Dylan a.k.a. ""Dil"" (Tara Charendoff), who, much to Tommy's chagrin, immediately dominates all the attention of their parents Didi (Melanie Chartoff) and Stu (Jack Riley).  But Tommy must learn to live with and love Dil when they, Chuckie, Phillip, and Lillian find themselves lost in the forest, thanks to a runaway toy wagon.  Not too far behind is Tommy's bratty cousin Angelica (Cheryl Chase), determined to reclaim her beloved Cynthia doll, which Dil has taken with him.
The adventures that ensue in the forest setting, ranging from some wild river rafting to an encounter with circus monkeys, are sure to keep the children enthralled (the kids at the screening I attended were noticeably silent) and amuse the adults.  Part of the appeal for the older set is the distinctive art style, which is rough and simple yet remarkably expressive.  Wisely, directors Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov resist the urge to punch up the visuals with gratuitous computer animation--at least, for the most part: a boulder, clouds, and Dil's head-trippy arrival into the world are the instances of CGI, and they are brief and effective.  The directors' big misstep, though, was bowing to Disney animation tradition and grafting on a few musical numbers to the film, which feel like they're, well, grafted on, with the exception of one inspired number where Angelica breaks out into a modified version of Blondie's ""One Way or Another,"" sung in reference to her missing Cynthia.  Production numbers aside, The Rugrats Movie is essentially just a big-screen episode of the series, and that's more than enough to satisfy any audience.
While Disney has a rich tradition in animated family entertainment, but its track record in live-action film is, to put it mildly, less than stellar.  The wan I'll Be Home for Christmas will do nothing to change that.  This piece of warmed-over sitcom-level schmaltz casts Tiger Beat pinup du jour Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a cocky prep school student who goes on a cross-country road trip to make it home in time for Christmas.  Sounds harmless enough, but then there's the gimmick: JTT is stuck in a Santa Claus outfit, and along the way he learns the true meaning of Christmas.  As lame and predictable as the story is, the key problem is Taylor Thomas himself.  His character is supposed to undergo a gradual attitude change as the film progresses, but he plays the character as such a smug bastard the whole way through that one senses no change, nor does one care if he changes.  Less than halfway through I'll Be Home..., I wanted to go home myself.

"Jan 1, 2000",negative,"  Despite its faults, ""Titanic"" had just enough plot to justify its three-hour running time. And the story behind ""Ben-Hur"" made for an enthralling nearly four-hour movie.  But judging from the example set by ""Meet Joe Black,"" filmmaker Martin Brest could have made either of those earlier movies into 10-hour opuses — since he managed to stretch a 100-minute premise to three-hour length here.  What's particularly irritating is that ""Meet Joe Black"" does have an interesting story germ, which has made for two good movies already — 1934's ""Death Takes a Holiday"" and a 1971 made-for-TV remake.  Don't get the wrong impression. The film isn't completely unwatchable, thanks in large part to a film-stealing performance by Anthony Hopkins. Also, the reinterpretation of the story (by four credited screenwriters) is more thoughtful than you might be led to believe.  However, the subject might feel fresher if we hadn't already seen ""City of Angels"" (also based on an earlier, much-better film), which trod similar ground. And the snail-like pacing robs it of much-needed vitality.  The new houseguest reveals his secret to Parrish — that he's actually Death and has assumed the form of a recently slain man. But he has a dual purpose in coming to Parrish: Not only is he there to claim the sixtysomething businessman, he's also curious about the human experience and wants his next victim to be a guide to physical existence.  The revelation causes Parrish to reassess his life, including his relationships in business and with his daughters, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), the older perfectionist, and Susan (Claire Forlani), the younger romantic.  And while Parrish tries to ready himself for death, Joe discovers human emotions, including romantic love. Susan has mistaken Joe for the charming stranger she met in a coffee shop (the man whose body he has claimed), and has fallen for him.  From there, the story diverges from the original film, seemingly to suit the whims of Brest and the screenwriters. It's a metaphysical journey, done in a metaphorical style, but it also lacks the necessary weight and impact.  Performance-wise, Pitt is decent enough, but he can't hope to hold a candle to Hopkins, who is terrific. Nor for that matter, can the supporting cast, though both Harden and Jeffrey Tambor try their best.  ""Meet Joe Black"" is rated R for profanity (including the PG-13 rated one), simulated sex (a fairly lengthy scene, in fact), a disturbing auto-pedestrian collision and use of vulgar slang."
"Jan 1, 2000",negative," 
Meet Joe Black has the dubious distinction of being the longest film to date of 1998. It is also one of the most tedious and bombastic. At a hair under three hours, it's shorter than James Cameron's Titanic, yet, when it comes to pace, Joe Black is glacial. Director Martin Brest, who helmed the enjoyable-but-also-too-long Scent of a Woman, is at his absolute worst here. Brest transforms a seemingly foolproof idea into an overblown bore.
 
There are slow movies, slooooooooooow movies, and then there's Meet Joe Black. Somehow, Brest manages to take a script lacking the content to justify a two hour motion picture and drag it out to three. Several obvious techniques are applied to accomplish this. The first, and most obvious, is that the director forces his actors to insert frequent, lengthy pauses into all dialogue (I kept wondering if he believed he was directing William Shatner). It wouldn't be as bad if the conversations were well-written, but most of what the characters say is sophomoric and rarely of much interest. Then, to add insult to injury, Brest never lets a scene end naturally, but keeps things going long past the point where the audience has lost interest.
 
Meet Joe Black was loosely suggested by the 1934 movie, Death Takes a Holiday, which, in turn, was based on a '20s stage play of the same name. This is not a strict remake - in fact, a key subplot is eliminated entirely - but it uses the black-and-white film's central conceit: what would happen if Death decided to temporarily abandon his place in the cosmos and reside for a brief time on Earth? Meet Joe Black postulates that he might look like Brad Pitt, fall in love with a beautiful young woman, and help save a good man's company. One thing this movie ignores, however, is how the universe fares with Death on vacation. Death Takes a Holiday went to great pains to describe the horrors of a world in which there was still illness and injury, but no death. Disappointingly, that potentially-fascinating aspect of the situation is ignored by Meet Joe Black, which wastes the bulk of its three hours on a passionless romance and an absurd corporate takeover scheme.
 
The film introduces Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), a corporate tycoon on the verge of celebrating his 65th birthday. He's also about to die from a heart attack. One night, after dinner, Death (Brad Pitt) appears with an offer: he'll put off ""taking"" Bill if, in return, Bill will introduce him to the wonders of being alive. The longer Bill can keep him interested in remaining corporeal, the longer the reprieve. So Bill introduces Death, renamed ""Joe Black,"" to his family: daughters Susan (Claire Forlani) and Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), son-in-law Quince (Jeffrey Tambor), and future son-in-law Drew (Jake Weber). With his almost childlike innocence, Joe is an immediate hit with everyone except Drew, who sees him as a rival for Susan's affections. His fears are justified; soon Joe and Susan are falling for each other, and there's nothing that Bill can do to stop the doomed relationship.
 
The centerpiece of Meet Joe Black is the romance between Joe and Susan, but it's not the kind of motion picture love affair that causes the spirit to soar. Forlani and Pitt may both possess matinee-style good looks, but they generate no heat or chemistry, and, as a result, they end up being featured in some of the most painfully protracted and awkward romantic sequences of any movie this year. As bland as they are together, they're not much more compelling when apart. At least Susan shows hints of three-dimensionality. Joe is unreadable - sometimes ingenuous, sometimes ominous, but never interesting. (And, since Death has been watching humankind for eons, how is it that he doesn't understand what kissing and sex are?) When it comes to a spiritual being taking a physical form, Nicholas Cage's angel in City of Angels wins the 1998 sweepstakes.
 
In general, Brad Pitt is not a terrible actor, and I give him credit for trying to broaden his range, but his work here is execrable. Pitt's acting, in concert with Brest's heavy-handed direction, makes this character a complete waste of celluloid. Joe Black looks like death warmed over. Anthony Hopkins does his best to add a dose of class to the proceedings, but there's only so much he can do, and he isn't given an especially meaty part. Claire Forlani, the young beauty from Basquiat, shows great promise, although there are a few scenes when she looks like a deer caught in a car's headlights. Jake Weber is suitably despicable as the traitorous Drew, and Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor provide adequate support.
 
As is Brest's trademark, there's plenty of emotional button-pushing, only this time, the director doesn't have a good feel for how best to manipulate the audience. There's a big speech near the end and a lot of melodramatic music, but, instead of leading the viewer into a state of emotional rapture, it all rings hollow. Perhaps it's because there's no rapport between the audience and the characters, or perhaps it's because the movie has long since worn out its welcome. Either way, the grand finale, like almost everything else in the movie, is a dud. As far as epics go, this one is a failure. In fact, by comparison, Meet Joe Black makes last year's Kevin Costner post-apocalyptic tale, The Postman, seem like a model of restraint and solid storytelling.
"
"Jan 1, 2000",positive," “Meet Joe Black” is a movie about a rich man trying to negotiate the terms of his own death. It is a movie about a woman who falls in love with a concept. And it is a meditation on the screen presence of Brad Pitt. That there is also time for scenes about sibling rivalry and a corporate takeover is not necessarily a good thing. The movie contains elements that make it very good, and a lot of other elements besides. Less is more. As the movie opens, a millionaire named William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is pounded by a heart attack, the soundtrack using low bass chords to assault the audience. He hears a voice--his own--in his head. On the brink of his 65th birthday, he senses that death is near. He tells his beloved younger daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) that he likes her fiance but doesn't sense that she truly loves him: “Stay open. Lightning could strike.” It does. A few hours later, in a coffee shop, she meets a stranger (Brad Pitt). They talk and flirt. He says all the right things. Lightning makes, at the very least, a near miss. They confess they really like each other. They part. He is killed. That night at dinner, she is startled to find him among her father's guests. The body of the young man is now occupied by Death, who has come to inform Parrish that his end is near. He does not recognize Susan. That's odd. Isn't Death an emissary from God? Shouldn't he know these things? He's been around a long time (one imagines him breaking the bad news to amoebas). This Death doesn't even know what peanut butter tastes like, or how to kiss. A job like that, you want a more experienced man. No matter. We accept the premise. We're distracted, anyway, by the way Brad Pitt plays the role. As both the young man in the coffee shop and as “Joe Black” (the name given him by Parrish), he is intensely aware of himself--too aware. Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation. Meryl Streep once said that an experienced actor knows that the words “I love you” are really a question. Pitt plays them as a compliment to himself. There is no chemistry between Joe Black and Susan because both parties are focused on him. That at least leads to the novelty of a rare movie love scene where the camera is focused on the man's face, not the woman's. Actresses have become skilled over the years at faking orgasms on camera, usually with copious cries of delight and sobs of passion. (As they're buffeted by their competent male lovers, I am sometimes reminded of a teenager making the cheerleader team, crossed with a new war widow.) A male actor would have to be very brave to reveal such loss of control, and Pitt's does not cry out. His orgasm plays in slow motion across his face like a person who is thinking, this is way better than peanut butter. I was not, in short, sold on the relationship between Susan and Joe. She spends most of the movie puzzling about a very odd man who briefly made her heart feel gooey. There is no person there for her, just the idea of perfect love. Joe Black is presented as a being who is not familiar with occupying a human body or doing human things. One wonders--is this the first time Death has tried this approach? Parrish strikes a deal with him (he won't die as long as he can keep Joe interested and teach him new things) and takes him everywhere with him, including board meetings, where Joe's response to most situations is total silence, while looking like the cat that ate the mouse. The Parrish character, and Anthony Hopkins' performance, are entirely different matters. Hopkins invests the dying millionaire with intelligence and acceptance, and he talks wonderfully well. “Meet Joe Black” consists largely of conversations, which are well-written and do not seem false or forced as long as Parrish is involved in them. His key business relationships are with the snaky Drew (Jake Weber), whom Susan dumps for Joe, and with the avuncular Quince (Jeffrey Tambor), his loyal but bumbling son-in-law. Quince is married to Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who knows Susan is her father's favorite but can live with that because Parrish is such a swell guy. (He's ethical, sensitive, and beloved--the first movie rich man who could at least squeeze his head and shoulders through the eye of the needle.) What's fascinating about Parrish is that he handles death as he has handled everything else. He makes a realistic assessment of his chances, sees what advantages he can extract, negotiates for the best possible terms and gracefully accepts the inevitable. There are times when he handles his talks with Death so surely that you wish Heaven had sent a more articulate negotiator. The movie's ending takes too long. There are farewells, reflections, confessions, reassurances, reconciliations, partings and surprises. Joe Black begins to get on our nerves with his knack for saying things that are technically true, but incomplete and misleading. The film would play better if he didn't always have to talk in epigrams. Even at the very end, when a line or two of direct dialogue would have cleared the air, he's still talking in acrostic clues. Still, there's so much that's fine in this movie, directed by Martin Brest (“Scent of a Woman”). Claire Forlani has a touching vulnerability as she negotiates the strange terms of her love. Marcia Gay Harden plays a wise, grownup scene with Parrish, as a loving daughter who knows she isn't the favorite. Jeffrey Tambor's performance is crucial; through his eyes, we understand what a good man Parrish is. And Anthony Hopkins inhabits a story that tends toward quicksand and finds dry land. You sense a little of his “Nixon” here: a man who can use anger like a scalpel, while still standing back to monitor the result. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism."
"Jan 1, 2000",negative," Personally, I’da thought Death himself would be more interesting than a doe-eyed Brad Pitt doing his best Forrest Gump imitation. I mean, he’s got a pretty cool job that takes him all over the world. He meets people from literally all walks of life. He’s been around, you know? But director Martin Brest and his four (count ’em) screenwriters would have us believe that Death is so busy with his grim reaping that he hasn’t had time to develop any semblance of a personality. Instead, Death — Death! — has become Hollywood’s favorite clichéd male of the moment: the soft, mushy, boyish, sexually non-threatening pin-up. Yawn.
William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins: Instinct, The Mask of Zorro) is a sort of Ted Turner-esque media-mogul type, only with an English accent instead of a Southern one. On the eve of his 65th birthday, he’s wealthy beyond dreams of avarice and his news corporation is about to sell for zillions to a competitor in the biz. He has daughters who dote on him — Susan (Claire Forlani: Mystery Men), a doctor, who’s involved with Drew (Jake Weber: Dangerous Beauty), Bill’s trusted right-hand-man; and Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who’s married to another member of the company’s board, Quince (Jeffrey Tambor: There’s Something About Mary). Life would be perfect, except that Bill’s been having chest pain — any idiot could see he’s having a bunch of heart attacks, but Bill doesn’t bother seeing a doctor. No, he waits until Death himself (Brad Pitt: Fight Club,, The Devil’s Own) shows up with an offer: Let him hang around for a while down here on Earth, and Bill can live a bit longer. Bill agrees, and introduces his new friend around as Joe Black. Oh, what a raucous black comedy this could have been: Bill running out to the best heart specialists in the world, trying to cheat Death himself, while Death has a wild time trying out all the sensual pleasures of the flesh. But no — Meet Joe Black is staid, somber, serious, oh-so earnest. At one point, Bill says to Death, “You’re violating the laws of the universe!” Really, I wouldn’t have thought anyone could say that line with a straight face. Hopkins manages to make it sound Death is breaking some arcane tax law. And it’s three freaking hours long. Three hours of endless meetings of the board of Bill’s company while the sale of the company is rehashed and dinner parties during which the details of Bill’s humongous birthday bash are discussed. Who cares what party favors should be given away to guests? Poor Death — he must wonder what all the fuss about Life is about. The truncated airline version of Meet Joe Black is credited as “An Alan Smithee Film,” which means Brest did not see the shortened version as worthy of having his name attached. Which means he actually wanted his actors dragging scenes out as their characters stare at one another in silence until the viewer wants to scream “Say something already!” You could step out for half the running time of this film and not miss anything, as most of it consists of characters sitting around wondering, “Who’s Joe Black?” Who, indeed? Death should have panache, style, something dark rippling underneath. Death should be almost irresistibly sexy. Instead, Joe Black is, as a friend of mine has so hilariously termed the dewy version of Brad Pitt to whom we’re subject here, like “a newly hatched chick,” all soft and warm and innocent and cuddly. And we’re supposed to believe that Susan has fallen “head over heels for Joe,” that she’s experiencing the electric, obsessive love her dad suggested she needed instead of the comfortable relationship she has with dorky Drew. Not only does the icy Forlani fail to ignite any sparks with Pitt, but there’s precious little reason evident why any woman would fall for Joe. And top it all with ridiculous plot coincidences; torpid, stilted dialogue; and a nice, pat happy ending, and you get a piece of glossy Hollywood tripe that is, well, deadly dull."

"Jan 1, 2000",negative," Oh, to die in a sugar-coated Hollywood movie while the spiritual schmaltz craze is under way! You look your best. You say wise things. Your loved ones cherish them. Perhaps there'll be a party with a dance band and fireworks in your honor. And you can spend as much time on your last farewells as it took to sink the Titanic, a ship that doubtless bears some responsibility for the rise of the four-star demise. You can even insist, as the oppressively lavish and snail-paced ''Meet Joe Black'' does, that the old wisdom about the rich man and the eye of the needle was dead wrong. William Parrish, the noble tycoon played zestily by Anthony Hopkins in this otherwise somnolent, emotion-free weepie, is just such a fortunate paragon. And ''Meet Joe Black'' does its prettified best to find inspiration in watching him die. Because William is wise, kind, generous and so well-heeled that he pays no attention to the great paintings on his remarkably many walls (Manhattan triplex, sleek offices, Versailles-like seaside palace), destiny even gives him a gift: a personal afterlife trainer in the form of Brad Pitt. As Death with blond highlights, Mr. Pitt might have been expected to give the film a pulse, but his role is conceived in an all too appropriately lifeless fashion. ''Meet Joe Black'' is a latter-day version of ''Death Takes a Holiday,'' the play that was filmed in 1934 with Fredric March and had some nicely fanciful notions of what might happen if Death gave himself a breather. For instance, it would be impossible to commit suicide by jumping off the Eiffel Tower, and withering plant life would flourish; perhaps, in the wildly overlong case of ''Meet Joe Black,'' enough plant life to refoliate deserts. But as directed by Martin Brest, who last made ''Scent of a Woman,'' ''Meet Joe Black'' doesn't even have time for such charming diversions. It's busy showing off the Parrish family's privileged life style ad nauseam (the lily-gilding is formidable, thanks to production design by Dante Ferretti and Emmanuel Lubezki's polished cinematography). And it devotes one whole dopey subplot to planning William's grandiose birthday fete. Meanwhile, William is having severe heart trouble, which takes the form of heavy editing, strident musical melodrama and agonized winces from Mr. Hopkins. His number is almost up, but Death would like to offer him a bonus round. In exchange for showing Death, a k a Joe Black, what it means to be a happy mogul, William can put his affairs in order without much of a rush. And Joe Black, while falling for Susan, can express innocent amazement at human life as if he were a great-looking version of E.T. There are repeated, ostensibly delightful scenes in which Joe discovers the wonders of peanut butter. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
