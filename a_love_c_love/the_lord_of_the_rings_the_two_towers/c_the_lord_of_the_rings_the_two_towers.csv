Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. No tengo miedo de decir que “Las Dos Torres” es la entrega más floja de la trilogía de “El Señor de los Anillos”. Lo bueno, en todo caso, es que el estándar establecido por las otras dos películas es tan alto, que esto quiere decir que la segunda cinta igual es extraordinaria. Simplemente no es tan extraordinaria como “La Comunidad del Anillo” o “El Retorno del Rey”. Se trata del capítulo intermedio, y por ende tiene que actualizarnos sobre lo que sucede con los personajes que conocimos en la primera película, avanzar con el conflicto entre héroes y villanos, y establecer personajes nuevos, conflictos nuevos, y situaciones que serán resueltas en la entrega final. No es una tarea fácil, y aunque cuenta con más defectos que sus contrapartes, igual hace un excelente trabajo manejando todos estos aspectos. “Las Dos Torres” comienza con una suerte de flashback, en donde vemos lo que de verdad sucedió con Gandalf El Gris (Ian McKellen) luego de que se cayó al abismo junto al demoníaco Balrog en el interior de las Minas de Moria. Luego de ese breve prólogo, regresamos a donde nuestros hobbits principales, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) y Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), quienes se encuentran perdidos, tratando de llegar a Mordor, hogar del malévolo Sauron. Es en esos peligrosos caminos que se terminan aliando con Gollum (Andy Serkis), una criatura frágil, desagradable y psicológicamente atormentada, que años atrás fue corrompida por el Anillo Único, y que ahora guía a nuestros héroes a la Reja Negra de Mordor. Mientras tanto, el humano Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), el elfo Legolas (Orlando Bloom) y el enano Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) están tras el rastro de un grupo de uruk-hai, quienes en la película pasada secuestraron a los hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) y Pippin (Billy Boyd). Es así que el trío termina adentrándose en la tierra de Rohan, señores de los caballos, donde se encuentran con un rey llamado Théoden (Bernard Hill), corrompido y manipulado por Saruman (Christopher Lee), y su sobrina llamada Eowyn (Miranda Otto), que está siendo acosada por un consejero manipulador llamado Grima (Brad Dourif). Nuestros héroes, por supuesto, tendrán que ayudar a toda esta gente, mientras el maléfico Saruman envía su enorme ejército de uruk-hai para invadir el país de Rohan. Finalmente, regresamos donde Merry y Pippin, quienes son rescatados por Treebeard (voz de John Rhys-Davies). Este último es un ent, un árbol que habla, camina y tiene pensamientos, y que se convertirá, junto a sus compañeros, en una figura importante a la hora de derrotar a Saruman y acabar con sus fábricas de uruk-hai en Isengard. Es así que tenemos estas tres líneas narrativas en paralelo, en las que seguimos a nuestros héroes, antes juntos, tratando de combatir las fuerzas de Saruman y Sauron, y encontrándose con nuevos amigos y enemigos. Frodo, Sam y Gollum, por ejemplo, terminan siendo capturados por el capitán Faramir de Gondor (David Wenham), hermano menor del finado Boromir quien, al igual que este último, considera que el Anillo Único es un arma poderosa que debe ser usada por los humanos.  Es así que nos vamos dando cuenta que “Las Dos Torres” es una experiencia distinta a la de la primera película. Nuestros héroes se han separado luego de la muerte de algunos de sus compañeros, y cuentan ahora con objetivos distintos, todos relacionados, por supuesto, a la batalla contra las fuerzas del mal. De las tres líneas narrativas principales, la más interesante, para vuestro servidor, es la de Aragorn, Legolas y Gimli. No solo nos permite ver lugares nuevos de la Tierra Media y conocer a personajes interesantes, sino que también tangibiliza algunos de los conceptos que han sido mencionados desde “La Comunidad del Anillo”. Nos permite ver exactamente por qué es que nuestros héroes están peleando; a quienes están defendiendo, qué tipo de personas pueblan las diferentes zonas de la Tierra Media, y qué tan difícil resulta enfrentarse a las fuerzas de Saruman. Todo esto llega a su clímax, por supuesto, en la Batalla de Helm’s Deep. Incluso más que la primera película, “Las Dos Torres” realiza varios cambios en relación a su fuente de inspiración, la mayoría estructurales, y el más significativo siendo poner a la Batalla de Helm’s Deep como el enfrentamiento climático de la historia. Esto resulta en una de las secuencias de guerra más impresionante de la historia del cine, en la que vemos tanto a nuestros héroes, como las fuerzas de Rohan y un grupo de soldados élficos (otro cambio importante en relación a la novela; estos personajes simplemente no aparecen en en libro), pelear contra el ejército de uruk-hai de Isengard.  Es un verdadero tour de force; una secuencia extensa pero consistentemente emocionante, en donde Jackson demuestra ser un maestro a la hora de escenificar y coreografiar violencia. Ya casi se ha deshecho de los planos cercanos y cámaras nerviosas de la primera película; todo es mostrado con claridad, justificando la fuerte presencia de luz en una escena nocturna, con imágenes impactantes y que, sin ser completamente realistas, están al servicio de la narrativa. Desde el comienzo, tenso y prologado, en donde los uruks llegan y se posicionan frente al castillo, hasta el asedio por parte del enemigo, Legolas y Gimli contando los monstruos a los que van matando, y el último esfuerzo por parte de Aragorn y Théoden por acabar la batalla de manera gloriosa y valiente… todo está dirigido com aplomo y seguridad, por un Jackson consciente de lo que debe hacer y cómo. Secuencias de esta potencia y poder visual no se ven con mucha frecuencia en el cine comercial contemporáneo. Por supuesto, el clímax violento de la historia no es lo único que tiene “Las Dos Torres” para ofrecer. La percepción que uno tiene de la Tierra Media, por ejemplo, es expandida con la introducción de Rohan —y los problemas tanto políticos como personales y hasta románticos que nuestros protagonistas encuentran en los salones de Théoden. Y siguiendo con los cambios respecto al libro, Jackson inserta un emocionante enfrentamiento entre humanos y jinetes de wargs, una escena que simplemente no existe en la obra de Tolkien. En la película, no obstante, sirve para inyectarle tensión adicional a la narrativa, darle una preocupación adicional a nuestros héroes, poner en peligro a Aragorn, y en general, mejorar el ritmo de la historia. Ninguna de estas películas es para los puristas —varios fanáticos seguramente les dirán lo mismo—, pero me animaría a decir que “Las Dos Torres” es la película que más cambios (para bien) ha sufrido respecto a su fuente de inspiración original. Respecto a las dos líneas narrativa restantes, desgraciadamente lo que resulta más tedioso es ver a Merry y Pippin junto con Treebeard. Este último es un personaje divertido, y de hecho, no me puedo quejar de la secuencia en la que finalmente logra involucrarse, junto con sus compañeros, en un asedio a Isengard. Pero todo lo que viene antes es lento y aburrido. Entiendo que esto es adrede —los ents son seres pacientes y calmados, que experimentan el tiempo de forma distinta a los humanos—, pero debo admitir que, al menos cuando veo esta película solo en casa, suelo saltearme las escenas en las que los hobbits esperan a que los árboles parlantes tomen algún tipo de decisión respecto a la guerra. Nuevamente; es una decisión creativa coherente con el libro y hecha a propósito, pero esto no quiere decir que funcione para vuestro servidor. Lo cual, por supuesto, nos deja con la historia de Sam y Frodo. Es aquí donde sí encontramos algo interesante, especialmente en los que se refiere a Gollum. Traído a la vida con expertise por el gran Andy Serkis, se trata de un personaje complejo, conflictivo, que cuenta con una personalidad doble. Primero está el inocente Sméagol, que solo quiere ayudar a sus amigos hobbits y llevarlos a donde quieren ir. Y luego está Gollum, la criatura corrompida por el Anillo Único, que se quiere deshacer de sus nuevos maestros para quedarse con la joya de Sauron. Esto resulta en escenas hipnotizantes que ponen en evidencia los considerables talentos de Serkis, uno de los pioneros de la actuación virtual, y quién más adelante interpretaría a King Kong para el mismísimo Jackson, y al líder de los simios, César, en la trilogía de “El planeta de los simios”. Su Gollum, no obstante, es quien lo comenzó todo, y es todo un deleite verlo en pantalla. Aparte de él también resulta fascinante ver la evolución de la relación entre Frodo y Sam. Habiendo comenzado como mejores amigos, somos testigos de como el Anillo va corrompiendo a Frodo, haciendo que se comporte casi como un drogadicto —siendo su droga, por supuesto, el Anillo mismo—, y alejándose de Samwise. Es una relación que se va haciendo cada vez más unilateral, con Sam tratando de jalar a Frodo a la luz, y Frodo siendo tentado por el Anillo para adentrarse en la oscuridad. Gollum, además, no ayuda —Frodo siente pena por él, e irónicamente, se va comportando cada vez más como él, incluso llamando al Anillo como su “tesoro”. Ver a estos personajes interactuando con el ya mencionado Faramir, nos dice mucho sobre la fortaleza de Frodo, la debilidad de los hombres, y el poder del Anillo —y nos permite, eventualmente, considerar a Faramir como alguien mejor que su hermano mayor. Más sobre él veremos, pues, en “El Retorno del Rey”. Ahora bien, es esta película la que va demostrando la afinidad que Jackson tiene por la tecnología digital. Mientras que “La Comunidad del Anillo” se siente tangible, combinando muy bien escenarios reales con maquetas y creaciones digitales, es aquí donde se comienza a abusar un poquito de lo generado por computadora. Se ve en la inclusión de los Espectros Voladores del Anillo, Gollum, Treebeard y algunos planos de la Batalla Final. Nada en “Las Dos Torres” luce horrible, pero sí se nota una mayor dependencia de la pantalla verde y el chroma key, con algunos planos luciendo un poco más falsos que otros. No es nada grave, y “Las Dos Torres” sigue siendo todo un logro técnico y creativo, pero hay algo de la practicidad y naturalidad de la primera cinta que se ha perdido acá. Nuevamente: al menos para vuestro servidor, “Las Dos Torres” es la más flojita de las tres películas de “El Señor de los Anillos”. Pero como se dijo líneas arriba, la calidad de las otras dos entregas es tan alta, que eso no convierte a esta segunda parte en algo difícil de recomendar. Sí, cuenta con algunos planos exageradamente sintéticos; y sí, no me fascinan las escenas con Treebeard y los dos hobbits. Pero en general, y con varios cambios estructurales respecto a la novela, “Las Dos Torres” de Peter Jackson logra cementar lo que se vio en la cinta anterior, y desarrollar mucho de lo que será presentado con mayor detalle en la película climática. La Batalla de Helm’s Deep es espectacular, Gollum es una de las creaciones digitales más importantes de la historia del cine, y en general, la experiencia de ver “Las Dos Torres” no podría ser más entretenida. Es un capítulo intermedio, y por ende no funciona de forma tan individual como los otros dos, pero igual se trata de un blockbuster expertamente realizado, y que ha envejecido muy poco. Sigo siendo fan."
"Jul 28, 2023",positive," You’d think that tacking on an additional 43 minutes to the three-hour movie would be overkill. But the extended version actually feels shorter than the theatrical release — possibly because it tells a more thorough story. “Two Towers” continues where “The Fellowship of the Ring” left off. With the Fellowship splintered into two groups, Frodo and Sam head for Mordor to destroy the Ring. They are aided by Gollum, a mysterious creature who once was a hobbit but now may not be trusted. Meanwhile, the trifecta of man, elf and dwarf (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli) head to Rohan to defend the last of a dying breed — human beings. Where the extended version enhances the original theatrical release is in its filling in of the details that director Peter Jackson had to cut out to ensure that moviegoers wouldn’t leave theaters before the film was over. Anyone who saw “Two Towers” in theaters last winter will recognize that the film’s beginning is different. Before Gollum confronts Frodo and Sam, the pair is shown joking and pratfalling before they realize exactly how lost they are. Their always ravenous fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin also get extended play, at one point floating through a sea of delectable treats. We also learn that the studly warrior and would-be king, Aragorn, actually is an old man of 87. The best back story, though, is that of Boromir and his brother Faramir. Boromir was killed in “Fellowship.” In the theatrical version of “Two Towers,” we saw Faramir as a rather heartless soldier who treated Frodo and Sam unkindly. In the DVD version, Jackson shows how the brothers grew up — with their father favoring Boromir and treating Faramir as the screwup he never was. You don’t excuse his behavior, but you begin to understand why he is who he is. This four-disc set also includes extras such as production documentaries, photo galleries and a really cool look at the making of Gollum/Smeagol. But the real treat is those extra 43 minutes that tie the film together without making it feel any longer. Currently you have JavaScript disabled.

"Aug 23, 2022",positive," Peter Jackson’s “The Fellowship of the Ring” was an extraordinary introduction to his “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. It not only introduced us to its compelling assortment of characters, but it also firmly planted us within J.R.R. Tolkien’s vast enchanting world. But it’s the second installment, “The Two Towers” where the series truly hits its stride. “The Two Towers” takes the story of its predecessor and expands it in every way. Fascinating new characters, more lands throughout Middle-Earth, and even higher stakes than before. But one of Jackson’s many great accomplishments is how seamlessly he blends these new pieces into the existing fabric. And despite the immensity of his scope, the movie never loses its intimacy. Picking up where “Fellowship” left off, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam’s (Sean Astin) journey to destroy the One Ring has grown more arduous and the weight of the ring more burdensome. As the two struggle to find a path to Mordor, the sallow, emaciated Gollum (Andy Serkis) secretly follows them. He was the ring’s former owner, consumed by its power and desperate to reclaim it. When Gollum is discovered Frodo shows pity and uses him as a guide against the pleas of a concerned Sam. A second story thread follows Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they follow the trail of their abducted Hobbit companions Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). They are led through the war-torn lands of Rohan whose King Theodin (Bernard Hill) lies under a spell of the wicked wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). And yet a third story thread follows the aforementioned Merry and Pippin who manage to escape their Uruk-hai captors after the Orc soldiers are attacked by Éomer (Karl Urban) and his exiled Riders of Rohan. The two Hobbits hide deep within Fanghorn Forest where they encounter a mysterious tree beings called Ents. The challenges for this incredible three-headed story are obvious. Huge in scale and with a ton of ground to cover, yet vitally important that it all comes together. Jackson melds together his many moving parts with remarkable precision. And of the several new characters introduced not a one feels wasted or undeserved. Each fit and have a place in Tolkien’s tumultuous world yet have their own personal storylines that take form without ever feeling pointless or intrusive. It’s a remarkable mixture of character and narrative. Then there is the genius of Jackson’s technique. From his sweeping camera combing the exquisite New Zealand landscapes to the subtlest of closeups capturing every worry, concern, and pain of the characters. Equally exhilarating are the action scenes both small and epic in size. It’s hard not to be blown away by his framing of the action as well as Weta Workshop’s extraordinary special effects. Jackson really opens it up with the first of the series’ huge battlefield sequences. The Battle for Helm’s Deep remains my favorite segment in the entire trilogy. Much more could be talked about including Jackson’s knack for not only building tension but maintaining it throughout a sequence. Also “The Two Towers” highlights Jackson’s keen ability to convey to the audience an incredible sense of the mystical and magical. The world he and his teams place us in are rich with imagination and the fantastical. But the greatest thing about the series is that it’s far more than eye candy and sparkly window dressing. It’s the characters and their stories that form the heart of trilogy. That’s especially true for “The Two Towers”. Someday I will have to watch these movies again.  I remember not liking Two Towers as much because it deviated from the book and I am a bit of a purist when it comes to that haha.  But I really do need to watch them again and maybe appreciate this one for its on-screen value, because books and screens are two very different mediums. Very true. I get being a purist, but you’re exactly right. They are very different mediums. For me, deviating from source material is okay as long as it makes sense and serves well the story the filmmaker is telling. What stinks is when filmmakers deviate from the source material and the results miss the mark. It’s tricky though. The whole trilogy has been on Starz! lately as I re-watched them as there’s so many things about the the trilogy that is awesome.  I agree that The Two Towers doesn’t get enough love as I enjoyed the strands of narrative into the three journeys of the Fellowship and how it impacts everyone.  The extended version of that film I feel is an improvement as it gave the audience more information about who Faramir as well as Boromir who we first saw in the film as kind of a dick but once we see him in the 2nd part of the extended film.  We realize that he was acting more like his father and was more concerned in giving his brother some praise. I adore the extended editions. They fill in so much information. I do love Boromir. I was indeed seduced by the power of the ring. But he was also a great redemption story. He sacrificed himself to try and buy time for the others. And his heartfelt confession to Aragorn still gets me. Same here.  I also loved what they did for Faramir in the extended version of the film where he took Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to a secret path as it showed his own path for not just redemption but also to keep the ring away from Gondor. Great review, but seeing “The Lord of the Rings” in the same line with the word “Retro” felt weird for me and a little bit painful, because for me it seemed like yesterday that the Lord was in cinemas, and I do miss very much the 2000-2002 period in films. My favourite has got to be the first movie, but I do get all the appreciation for this one too. I know. I’m thinking I should take Retro off. Is it really retro? I don’t know. It would certainly make me feel better if it wasn’t! LOL! While I’ll always have a soft spot for Fellowship, particularly the Balrog sequence, Two Towers will always be the best overall film in the trilogy for story, character and pacing, and of course the Helms Deep attack. When that wall blew apart, so did my mind. Just an astonishing film accomplishment.  (Disclosure: over the last few weeks I’ve been digging into both the Rings and Hobbit appendicies DVDs, reminiscing over my love of all things Middle Earth.) Oh man, those extended editions are so good. Love them. As for Two Towers so many scenes stand out. When the wall blew…yes. The expressions and sense of dread. It’s fabulous. You really feel a sense of doom. But when Gandolf shows up with a light to the east…I get chills."
"May 20, 2022",positive,"The Battle of Helm's Deep, in it of itself, is a grand cinematic achievement. The Two Towers is possibly the best middle entry of any film trilogy ever. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Mar 12, 2022",positive," Peter Jackson’s cinematic recreation of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) is thrilling, enthralling, and dizzyingly exciting. Jackson finds the soul of the film in Viggo Mortensen’s wandering warrior-prince Aragorn, reveals the torment in Elijah Wood’s chosen-one pilgrim Frodo and the soul-crushing weight of the ring that Tolkien could only talk around. And he turns the wary relationship between Frodo and the gnarled, psychotically obsessed Gollum into the defining drama of Frodo’s hopes and fears along the quest. The famously computer generated Gollum is a wonder of a character, a feral stray dog with a schizophrenic nature at war with himself when he gets his first taste of kindness from Frodo, as tragically human as any character in the party. The motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis set the bar for the marriage of acting and special effects. Jackson dares to throw the viewer into the fray without little more than a brief, nightmarish flashback, and turns the Battle of Helm’s Deep, a brief ten page episode in the novel, into the thrilling turning point in the war: the first glimpse of the coming apocalypse and the triumph of solidarity in the face of the march of evil. Jackson’s camera once again swoops over landscapes like an eagle, charges through the hordes that blanket the earth, and slows only in moments of intimacy. More than simply translate the fantasy masterpiece to the screen with respect, Jackson brings blood and thunder and human scale to a tale so long relegated to the archetypes of myth. The returning cast includes Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Frodo’s loyal friend Samwise, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd as hobbits Merry and Pippin, Orlando Bloom as elf warrior Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as dwarf warrior Gimli, and Christopher Lee as Saruman. Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Karl Urban, and Brad Dourif costar. Months after the film was released to DVD and Blu-ray, Jackson released an extended version exclusively to home video. Running almost four hours long, Jackson’s extended version weaves not just deleted scenes back into his vision, but additional background and character insight shaved out of existing scenes. Most of it is, appropriately, folded into the beginning (which reintroduces Frodo with an entirely different scene) and ending (giving the audience more time to ease down from the power of the Battle of Helm’s Deep). Though not “essential” information, it adds in the kind of weight that gives the epic even greater heft and home video is the perfect arena for such an expansion. There is about 40 minutes of new footage all told; 11 minutes of longer version belong to credits dedicated to the members of the Lord of the Rings Fan Club. Don’t miss a single recommendation.

Supplements on the two disc special edition of the original theatrical version include the 14-minute made-for-cable documentary On the Set: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (originally made for Starz) and the 43-minute WB special Return to Middle-Earth, Sean Astin’s five-minute side project The Long and Short of It (a sweet little short made with volunteers from the cast and crew) and a “making of” Astin’s film, and eight brief behind-the-scenes featurettes originally made for www.lordoftherings.net. Disc 3 and 4—”The Appendices”—feature an epic documentary to match the production, following the film from adapting and scripting through constructing the sets and props, shooting the production, and creating the special effects, to editing, scoring, and mixing the film, all organized in well-shaped chapters that can be viewed individually or seen straight through as a single six-hour overview. The chapter on Gollum (a fascinating invitation into the process of creating a fully fleshed out CGI character and a tribute to the skills of Andy Serkis, whose “performance” helped sculpt and enrich that character) can stand alone as a feature length piece. To supplement the documentary are an atlas of Middle-earth tracing the journey, an interactive map of New Zealand showing the shooting locations, and galleries featuring hundreds of behind-the-scenes photographs, personal cast photos, and production art (which can also be viewed as slideshows with commentaries by the artists). The Gift Set features a Gollum polystone statue created by Sideshow Weta, a bonus DVD with a documentary about the Weta Workshop and how the Gollum statue was created, and a printed companion piece showing how Gollum evolved from pencil sketch to digital character.

"Nov 17, 2020",positive,"What Jackson's storytelling lacks in coherency - a major problem for non-Tolkienites with the first film - he makes up for with a new-found sense of urgency and a richer blend of drama, humour and human emotion."
"Oct 27, 2020",positive," Amazon Prime Video has developed a sizeable bank of movies over the years, and remains arguably the best streaming platform to offer a cross section of Indian cinema. But endless scrolling to find the gems can be tiresome. That's why we're bringing you our list of 60 of the best movies currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video India (as of October 2020). Let the bingeing begin. The Adam Driver-led riveting investigative thriller chronicles the Senate's investigation into the CIA's use of torture following the 9/11 attacks. The Report is both engrossing and infuriating, and serves as the perfect counter piece to Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty. Lijo Jose Pellissery's kinetic spectacle, based on S Hareesh's short story Maoist, explores masculinity like few films before it. At a basic level, the film is about retrieving a lost buffalo. But, that one-line summary doesn't do justice to the surreal energy and spectacular chaos of the film. People have been picking it apart for its 'meaning' ever since it released. We invite you to do the same. A gangster-esque saga set in the world of politics, Prithviraj Sukumaran's impressive directorial debut is the larger-than-life masala film done right. The Mohanlal-starrer is bursting with swag, has a genuinely gripping plot and is full of delicious twists and turns resulting in a strong political drama and delicious revenge saga in equal measure. Nag Ashwin's Mahanati is an ode to one of Telugu cinema's greatest actors—Savitri. Nag Ashwin's take on the Saviritri story successfully explores a complex woman and her turbulent journey, brought to life by an unforgettable performance from Keerthy Suresh. Todd Haynes' spellbinding book adaption is as visually dazzling as it is sensitive. Haynes takes you on a deeply affecting journey by following the adventures of two deaf children across different time periods while exploring their curious connection. The action epic that put Kannada cinema on the map like few before it, became the first Kannada film to cross the Rs. 100-crore mark at the box office. The ambitious gangster saga led by 'Rocking Star Yash' is a rousing underdog story which gives Indian cinema yet another larger-than-life franchise to look forward to. Kathryn Bigelow's expansive drama follows the decade-long international manhunt for Osama bin Laden, from the events of 9/11 to his eventual death at the hands of US Marines. In Konkona Sen Sharma's sparkling directorial debut, a shy and sensitive Indian student (Vikrant Massey) pays a heavy price for his gentleness, while on a road trip with his conceited relatives and family friends. Led by a hauntingly beautiful performance from Massey, A Death In The Gunj remains one of the strongest ensemble dramas of recent years. Tamil cinema has had its share of father-daughter based films but few are as affecting, complex and disturbing as this Mammootty starrer. The film dives into the psyche of a helpless father who's taken custody of his teenage daughter suffering from cerebral palsy. Peranbu is a piercing coming of age drama which also raises several pertinent questions about parenting, disability and sexuality. Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's real-life love story serves as inspiration for the film that put romantic comedies back on the map. Bursting with heart and great one liners, The Big Sick is a witty and charming exploration of love and family while exploring clashing cultures with a much needed dose of empathy. Led by a career-topping performance from Ram Charan, set in the '80s, Rangasthalam tells the story of an innocent villager with a hearing impairment who gets mixed up in a political feud involving his elder brother. Director Sukumar impressively uses the big masala film to explore caste, class and oppression. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep star in a movie from writer-director Greta Gerwig's that does justice to their insane collective talent and the book on which the movie is based. That's it. That's all you need to know. When a boy from an impoverished and oppressed farming family kills a big shot, his father (Dhanush in fantastic form) fears retribution. He flees with the boy, the big shot's men in pursuit. Coming right after Vetri Maaran-Dhanush's gorgeous Vada Chennai, Asuran evokes mixed feelings. The screenplay is brilliantly cyclical and there's no denying the power of the mood and the material in a film you won't be able to shake off for days on end. A woman wakes up without clothes in a desolate building. You'd think you were in for a survival drama like Trapped. But Rathna Kumar 's Aadai plays with your head by making Kamini (a sensational Amala Paul) a fascinating and morally questionable figure, leading to one hell of a morality tale. When it comes to huge spectacle action, there is no greater living example than the chaotic achievement that is George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. Fury Road is just non-stop, carefully crafted carnage which somehow manages to be coherent, all while having used minimal CGI. Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it. In an industry inundated with stories where things always work out, Akshay Roy's Meri Pyaari Bindu gave Hindi cinema a rare look at heartbreak. It made a long overdue case for why some relationships don't always work out and how sometimes that is the happy ending. Ayushmann Khurrana stars as the writer who can't get over the one that got away, Parineeti Chopra as Bindu. A bleak drama from Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea is a deeply personal film which examines the ways tragedy can wear away at a person's soul, and whether it is possible to come back from the brink. Despite the heart-breaking premise,  the film is filled with unexpected moments of humour and warmth. Winner of the National Award for best Hindi film, Rajkummar Rao stars as a fish-out-of-water government clerk who tries to run a free and fair election in the Naxal-controlled conflict-ridden jungles of India in a nuanced film that explores the painful shortcomings of Indian democracy. Gareth Evans' gloriously violent Indonesian film features a police officer trapped in an apartment building filled with an army of bad guys he has to fight his way through. It has relentless end-to-end killing with some of the most brutal fight scenes you've ever seen. But despite its singular bone breaking vision, it still manages to have a satisfying plot and some fantastically well-crafted scenes of tension amidst the blood bath. On face value, Doug Liman's Edge Of Tomorrow deals with familiar tropes – of a war for the planet and time loops and alien invasions – but it's brilliantly executed with some fantastic combat sequences. Not to mention one of the most badass female action heroes in Emily Blunt's Full Metal Bitch. Edge Of Tomorrow has Tom Cruise as a man forced to relive the same day over and over again in a spectacular action flick that you just want to revisit over and over again. War is the definitive Bollywood action film of its time which proved to the world that Hindi cinema can do the slick sophisticated blockbuster, and do it well. It's Tiger Shroff's best film and the only film that's really known how to capture his ability and channel it into something actually cinematic. Even at its most ridiculous it's never not fun and it perfectly nailed the novelty of the 'two hero film'. War is an unapologetic star vehicle at its best, bursting with style, attitude and just pure swag. It's hard to pick just one amongst Peter Jackson's Middle Earth epic. In terms of battle sequences alone,  it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, followed closely by the Battle for Minas Tirith in The Return Of The King. In one of the greatest good vs evil stories ever told, Peter Jackson throws you onto the battlefield with your favourite characters. It's also straight up badass, because…Legolas. Just Legolas. The predictable but urgent Malayalam-language thriller has the sort of moral premise that allows it to transcend the trappings of ""lockdown storytelling"" and exist as an organic computer-screen movie – more on the lines of international hits like Searching and Unfriended. The revelations aren't shocking, but there's an arc to its characters – especially Fahadh Faasil's – that humanizes both the distance and intimacy of modern technology. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chupke Chupke is a laugh-out-loud comedy of errors about a man who is pretending to be a driver. Expect constant confusion and choreographed chaos of the best kind. The definitive coming-of-age drama, which marked the directorial debut of Farhan Akhtar, remains just as complex and intricate today as it did when it came out almost 20 years ago. Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna play loyal friends that overcome various obstacles of life in a film that captures college life and the transition into adulthood like no film before it, and few since have. One of Indian cinema's most iconic comedy, the film takes a deep, dark look into the scandals of bureaucracy and politics. Two Mumbai-based photographers get caught up a builder's surreptitious dealings with the government along with a murder which ends with the comical revamp of the Mahabharata that will forever be etched in cinema history. Few movies can claim to have the level of national presence and dedicated following of Jab We Met. With Geet's lovable chattiness, Pritam's groovy soundtrack and so much more, Imtiaz Ali created his own canon for Bollywood rom-coms filled with humour and emotion of an unforgettable kind. Amitabh Bachchan's, ""I can talk English, I can walk English, I can laugh English"" is forever etched in the hallmark of great Bollywood dialogues. This is a blockbuster comedy difficult to top. Bachchan maintains his comic timing, beating thugs with style, and with Bappi Lahiri's evergreen soundtrack, this action-comedy is one for the ages. The directorial debut of Nandita Das, set one month after the 2002 Gujarat Riots, explores the lives of the survivors and victims unabashedly – those that witnessed an entire city burn and crumble. This pithy and haunting film goes deep into the psychological and mental anguish the communal riots caused, and through that, makes a plea for peace and harmony. Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane brings his signature pop-culture-referencing insult-comedy style to this story of a boy whose birthday wish brings his teddy bear to life. Except 30 years later, it's not as cute anymore as the two man-children just lounge around doing drugs and being idiots. Ted gives us one of the greatest comedic characters – a lovable, foul-mouthed cuddly toy full of memorable one-liners who armed us with an arsenal of handy insults. Set against the backdrop of the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, individuals from various walks of life come together to contain its spread in this gripping Malayalam-language thriller. Parvathy Thiruvothu, Tovino Thomas, and Revathi star in a film that's never been more relevant and, despite its haunting subject matter, is ultimately a story of hope. One man's heart-pounding crusade to tear down the crooked system that created him, The Bourne Trilogy is a shining example of a single story told over three parts, (the less said about the 2016 attempt to reboot the series, the better). The sophisticated espionage series that reinvented onscreen action gave us a new, more rooted kind of spy thriller, far removed from the Bond school of blockbuster, but no less exhilarating. Rajkumar Santoshi's immensely quotable cult classic about a pair of hapless slugs who hatch hare-brained schemes to get rich (played by Aamir Khan and Salman Khan), remains every bit the whirlwind comedy it was when it came out decades ago. For everything else, there's Crime Master Gogo. In what remains one of the greatest and most influential gangster epics of all time, City Of God chronicles the lives of young gangsters in Brazil's sultry slums, giving us a sprawling saga of drugs, poverty, crime and utter swag. A shining example of the new wave of Telugu cinema, the well-crafted comedy thriller starring Naveen Polishetty is as hilarious as it is engrossing, masterfully navigating the delicate balance act of humour and a tense, high stakes plot surrounding a series of murders. Years before he was asked to reboot another iconic space saga, JJ Abrams was tasked with reimagining Star Trek, leading to a well-conceived and sorely underrated reimagining of the iconic franchise. Star Trek, masterfully paid homage to the old while paving the way for the new, whilst also making it accessible to those of us who weren't previously married to the Star Trek franchise. With a strong ensemble cast recreating beloved characters, Abrams gave us an origin story of the USS Enterprise and its colourful crew, led by the Chris Pine's charismatic James T Kirk. Shankar's pure, unhinged sci-fi spectacle, for all its slipups, has two things we rarely see in Indian cinema – dazzling imagination and sheer vision. The scale, the visuals, the many forms of Rajinikanth going head to head with Akshay Kumar make the film a must watch. Rahi Anil Barve's debut film must be celebrated not only for its ambition, gumption and scale, but also its fascinating exploration of the horror fantasy genre. While looking for a secret treasure in a village in 20th-century Maharashtra, a man and his son face the consequences of building a temple for a legendary demon who's not supposed to be worshipped. A minor confrontation between a cop and an ex-army man snowballs into an escalation of egos and powerplay. Directed and written by Sachy and anchored by two terrific performances from Biju Menon and Prithviraj Sukumaran, Ayyappanum Koshiyum is a fascinating exploration of masculinity and privilege, neatly packaged in a riveting thriller. Deliciously despicable and delectably sinister, Bornila Chatterjee's The Hungry is a gloriously well-made revenge drama lead by an electric ensemble of seasoned performers like Naseeruddin Shah, Tisca Chopra and Sayani Gupta. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie lead the ensemble cast of Quentin Tarantino's ""fairy tale tribute"" to the waning days of Hollywood's golden age, which follows an ageing actor (DiCaprio) and his long-time friend and stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate a changing industry. This nostalgic throwback to classic sci-fi thrillers follows a young switchboard operator and a radio DJ whose discovery of a mysterious audio frequency sets off a series of discoveries that lead them deep into the unknown. The Vast of Night is a film you won't forget, announcing its writers, director, and cast as new talents to watch out for. Set in the coastal of village of Chellanam near Ernakulam, Lijo Jose Pellissery's sixth film traces a series of unfortunate events that follows the death of Vavachan Mestri (Kainakary Thankaraj) a few moments after he tells his son Eeshi (Chemban Vinod Jose) about his dream funeral. Despite the sombre setting, the film takes the form of a dark comedy with several laugh-out-loud moments popping up every few minutes. Four brothers who share a love-hate relationship stand behind one of their own in matters of the heart in this Malayalam-language family drama that has fast become one of the most beloved Indian films of recent years. An idealistic young man from a poor, oppressed caste family strikes a friendship with a much wealthier female classmate at law school in this Tamil-language film, earning him the wrath of her relatives and the society at large. Directed by Mari Selvaraj and produced by Pa. Ranjith, Pariyerum Perumal is a scathing look at the caste system and the society that is blind to it. After Mulk and Article 15, Anubhav Sinha set his sights on domestic abuse in his most recent social drama Thappad. The film stars Taapsee Pannu as a devoted wife whose entire world is shaken after her seemingly loving husband (Pavail Gulati) slaps her in a fit of rage. What follows is her messy, turbulent quest for justice and divorce, all while her family, friends and lawyers try and make her 'see reason' and not overreact at what was 'just a slap'. Gully Boy followed a predictable underdog trajectory but Zoya Akhtar and co-writer Reema Kagti build on these layers of finely etched relationships, memorable characters and an unforgettable 18-track soundtrack. When Murad finally says, Apna Time Aayega, you believe, for a brief moment in time, that you can also overcome the odds.  And what could be better than that? Writer-director Sharat Katariya's delightfully sensitive romantic drama, set in the Haridwar of 1995, is about a boy with low self-esteem and no achievements (Ayushmann Khurrana) who is compelled by his family to marry a smart, feisty, educated girl (Bhumi Pednekar) despite his objections to her plus-sized physique. The Harry Potter movies are the rare series to defy the notion that the books are always better. Rather than better or worse, the films were almost an extension of the books, wonderfully bringing to life JK Rowling's fantastical Wizarding World as the definitive franchise an entire generation grew up with. Based on the 2003 book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of misunderstood teenager Hiccup, who is overlooked and underestimated by his warrior father, who forms an unlikely friendship with a dragon. How To Train Your Dragon is the perfect mix of beautiful animation, delightful characters, and a fantastic adventure rooted in the idea of empathy. Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday is more of a feeling – singularly shocking, stirring, cataclysmic, yet journalistic and depressingly objective, and one of the great achievements in Indian cinema. The reflective effect of this movie about the 1993 bomb blasts (based on Hussain Zaidi's superbly researched novel) was so powerful that nothing less than a TADA verdict forced the courts to certify its ""legality"". Vishal Bhardwaj's first film in his Shakespeare trilogy was an adaptation of Macbeth beautifully transposed to the Mumbai underworld. Maqbool was a triumph of casting with unforgettable performances from its ensemble of stalwarts like Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri. Shoojit Sircar's October is a thing of heart-breaking beauty. A boy (Varun Dhawan) coasts through life aimlessly until random tragedy strikes, taking over his life in ways he doesn't quite understand leaving him forever changed. An unshakeable portrait of pain and trauma, Honey Boy is based on Shia Labeouf's adolescence as a child actor with an abusive father, which sees the actor play the role of his father. Director Alma Har'el brings a sense of delicacy to a painful story that leaves you better off for having watched it. Bong Joon Ho's history-making take on class warfare and family strife was carefully crafted suspense at its best resulting in a rare movie that is as layered as it is accessible. A delicious Bollywood-ish tale follows the love story of Rachel (Constance Wu) and Nick (Henry Golding). The twist being that Nick is actually the son of one of the richest families in the world. Let the lavish, gorgeous chaos ensue. Six uncomfortably hilarious fables of revenge play out in this Argentinian anthology from writer-director Damián Szifron which escalates relatable grudges into tales of apocalyptic revenge. One of the most impactful, immersive war movies of all time, Steven Spielberg's cinematic achievement takes us as close to the front line as possible offering a human take on the chaos of war. Shimit Amin's iconic sports drama remains every bit the achievement it was when it came out, giving us one of Hindi cinema's greatest underdog stories led by an unforgettable SRK as Kabir Khan."
"Oct 9, 2020",positive," t begins with a flashback to one of the most pivotal scenes in the first film – elaborating on the apparent demise of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) the wizard, as he fought off the deathly advances of a fiery demon in the underground dwarf mine graveyard. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his faithful hobbit companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue their perilous, protracted journey to Mordor, where they hope to destroy a powerful ring that threatens to empower the villainous sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee). In turn, Saruman plots to resurrect the ancient evil of the dark lord Sauron, whose spiritual entity resides within the golden halo, hellbent on conquering Middle Earth. Pursuing a band of cannibalistic orcs that have captured two additional hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are the remnants of the fellowship of the ring: the elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom), the human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). Meanwhile, as Saruman’s armies cut a swathe of death and destruction through the peaceful countryside, several human soldiers of the kingdom of Rohan are marked as traitors and banished from the realm. Eomer (Karl Urban), their leader, commands a slaughter of the orcs, further displacing Merry and Pippin, who escape into the woods only to encounter the chief shepherd of the forest, a branch and leaf-covered giant called Treebeard. As the human population dwindles under Saruman’s massacres, survivors flock to Helm’s Deep, a stronghold of 300 warriors that appears hopelessly outnumbered by the army of more than 10,000 barbarian troops marching to annihilate the fortress. This immediate sequel to the hugely successful “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings” ups the ante on special effects, featuring outstanding computer animation of the Gollum character, which was only briefly glimpsed in the first film. His bodily movements, facial contractions, and split-personality voice-work are greatly attributable to actor Andy Serkis and his motion-capture expertise. Treebird is equally impressive, along with his throng of Ents, as well as the extra footage of the Balrog and Nazgul dragons. Once again, the orc and goblin makeup effects and costuming are sublimely realized; sets and props also continue to contribute to the overall visual appeal. Unfortunately, the stunts are slightly more reliable on CG, too, causing them to be less rousing and convincing. The hobbits remain clumsy, recklessly impulsive, and now at odds with one another, creating their own additional dilemmas, while numerous other haphazardly crafted circumstances prolong the penetration of Mordor’s walls. The inclusion of King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan, the death of his son, the evacuation of his city, and the demonic possession of his soul offer little to strengthen or deepen the persevering main characters. Correspondingly, the supporting role of servant Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) is the least inspiring sub-villain in the series, designed without the usual subtlety of evildoers who have yet to reveal their misdeeds. Instead, he’s so clearly monstrous that his feigned allegiance borders on insulting to the audience (his name is similarly ridiculous). Arwen’s (Liv Tyler) later pilgrimage away from Rivendell also drags. Without an explanation of the afterlife or the beliefs surrounding it, save for a hinting at a god or gods governing Gandalf’s reappearance, the winning return of the unclearly powerful wizard appears as yet another contrived plot point. It’s one of several that spring up during this middle chapter of the trilogy, which already feels weighty with the slow progression of the story. And flashbacks are even more prevalent than in the previous movie, designating a signature narrative technique director Peter Jackson favors throughout the series. But the climactic battle of Helm’s Deep – though it still leaves much to be resolved for the final part – is a breathtakingly colossal skirmish in the rain and mud and fog, of nearly indescribable magnitude, involving hundreds of extras and stunning action choreography, which takes place concurrently with the comparably epic, redemptive storming of Saruman’s tower.

Before I start, I must confess that I have never read “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy (or “The Hobbit,” for that matter). So before any rabid Lord of the Rings fans pull out the torches and pitchforks to burn down my castle, I want to warn you that I don’t know squat about how “The Two Towers” compared to the book. In a word, “The Two Towers” is stunning. It is truly a masterpiece. Better than the first film, “The Two Towers” delivers a powerful story of fighting against insurmountable odds. Like the other legendary epic films of the 20th century, “The Lord of the Rings” is shaping up to be a trilogy to live on in movie history. Where “The Fellowship of the Ring” was clearly Frodo’s movie, “The Two Towers” spends more time with Aragorn (a human), Gimli (a dwarf) and Legolas (an elf). The fellowship is now broken, with Gandalf presumed dead and three parts scattered across Middle Earth. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his fellow hobbit Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) are the keepers of the all-powerful ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control Middle Earth. Now broken off from the group, Frodo and Samwise continue towards Mount Doom, where they can finally dispose of the ring properly. However, along their way, they pick up a companion – a wiry, gangly creature named Gollum. Once in possession of the ring, Gollum now joins the two hobbits to (maybe) see the end to “my precious.” Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies ) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are in pursuit of an army of uruk-hai (genetically transformed orcs, for the uninitiated) that have kidnapped the other two hobbits, Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). Along the way, the three heroes meet up with Gandalf (Ian McKellen, now promoted to Gandalf the White), who has been resurrected to help finish his quest. The fractured fellowship heads to the city of Rohan and befriends the king. They stay with the Rohan to help defend this last vestige of humans from the 10,000-strong uruk-hai army. Even though it is a three-hour film, “The Two Towers” doesn’t waste any time getting into the story. Where the “The Fellowship of the Ring” had a nifty little intro section in which Cate Blanchett explained all the hubbub about the rings and their powers, “The Two Towers” just dives right into the film. Not that this is a bad thing, but if you’re memory’s a bit fuzzy, you might want to rent “The Fellowship of the Ring” and watch it again before you go to this sequel. Not only does director Peter Jackson waste no time getting into the film, he wastes no time at all. In fact, this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition. The film is so jam-packed with excitement, story and characters that some of the faces you’ve seen in the first film are mere flashbacks in this one. Actors like Liv Tyler (as the princess Arwen), Cate Blanchett (as the forest queen Galadriel) and Hugo Weaving (as the elf king Elrond Peredihl) have only bit parts here. But this doesn’t detract from the film. In fact, there’s so much in “The Two Towers” that you’ll need to not just invest three hours in it – but six or even perhaps nine – to absorb everything it has to offer. The incredible battle sequences are breathtaking, producing armies in the thousands to fight against one another, filling the entire screen. Additional special effects kudos are due for the creature Gollum, which is completely computer generated. The technology has grown so much over the years that it is able to emote almost at the level of a real actor. At times, it is so very easy to forget that Gollum is just a smattering of pixels because he blends so well into the background and feels so real. Bringing CGI into the 21st century, Gollum isn’t the annoying mess that was Jar Jar Binks. Of course, there could have been more of the character of Saruman the White, simply for the fact that he is played by the unbeatable Christopher Lee. Strangely, the flashes back to Saruman’s stronghold in Orthanc, seem the most enjoyable with Lee’s presence overseeing the creation of the uruk-hai army. Perhaps one of the best sequels ever made, “The Two Towers” stays true to the first film simply because it was filmed simultaneously (along with the third film). This way, the production design, characters and feel is completely seamless. The only film to come this close to the look and feel of the original is “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” With a more satisfying ending and a tremendous battle that makes “Braveheart” look like a group of kindergartners playing red rover, “The Two Towers” whets the appetite for the final film, “The Return of the King.” Thank god we only have to wait a year. "
"Nov 12, 2014",positive," Peter Jackson's The Two Towers (aka 'Look Who's Tolkien Too') makes no concession to those unacquainted with the first part of the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, other than to reprise the wizard Gandalf's spectacular fall into the pit of Khazad-dûm. He expects us to know, at least in general terms, the tale of some decent folk in Middle-Earth embarking on a dangerous quest to place the One Ring beyond reach of its wicked creator by consigning it to the Fire of Doom in the process and to defeat the evil schemes of the megalomaniac wizard Saruman (the commanding Christopher Lee). So from the start the chief heroic characters of the first part are split into three separate groups that will not meet again in this episode. This leads to occasional confusion but produces pace and variety. In the first strand, the leading hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his devoted squire Sam (Sean Astin) meet the treacherous hominoid Gollum (one of the influences presumably for Dobby in Harry Potter), who becomes their guide. In the second, the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen looking, sounding and swashbuckling like Errol Flynn), the pawky Scottish dwarf Gimli and the Elf archer Legolas, ride to the defence of the embattled King Theoden (Bernard Hill). The third strand features the two lesser hobbits, Pippin and Merry, who are protected by Treebeard, a splendid walking tree out of Arthur Rackham who gets a good laugh from the line 'What is a hobbit?' Treebeard commands a company of fellow giant trees and, in addition to delivering a discreet eco-message about deforestation (another of Saruman's sins), they prove formidable fighters. Discovering that their bite is worse than their bark, Pippin and Merry lead their arboreal allies in a Dunsinane-style assault against the evil empire. There is no girl in any of these three groups and the film finds little work for its heroines. (This is also the case in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione is also marginalised.) Certainly there is nothing like the elf maiden Arwen's marvellous equestrian rescue of Frodo, a major highlight of the earlier picture. Their job is to flee with the children and the old folk. When the beautiful aristocratic Eowyn (Miranda Otto) wants to take up arms she is upbraided by her uncle, King Theoden, who believes that the fighting should be left to the men. And God knows there is plenty of it. This film packs enough battles into three hours to keep the residents of Valhalla talking for a year. Even the peaceful elf community decides to join the humans in the war against the totalitarian Sauron, apparently abandoning their old separatist slogan 'We Our Elves'. Five-digit hordes, mostly digitally created, go into battle every couple of minutes, with losses that even on the Western Front (JRR Tolkien had first-hand knowledge as an infantry officer) would have been extreme. The battles and sieges are conducted with the ferocity of the Crusades, Agincourt and Stalingrad and they are led up to and orchestrated in a manner that recalls the great movie epics of Fritz Lang and Sergei Eisenstein. These sequences are breathtaking, as indeed is much of a beautifully designed and photographed film that draws for its visual style on Caspar David Friedrich, the Pre-Raphaelites, Art Nouveau illustrations for children's books and the apocalyptic biblical landscapes (all flaming mountains, lightning and floods) of the Victorian visionary John Martin. The New Zealand settings have a rugged, primeval grandeur, though there are too many swooping helicopter shots over the landscape. Setting the second Harry Potter film beside this second Tolkien confirms with even greater clarity the difference detected between the two enterprises when the first movies appeared together a year ago. Though both are eclectic in their mythic and literary sources, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is to The Two Towers what glossy pantomime versions of Robinson Crusoe and Aladdin are to the Daniel Defoe novel and the Arabian Nights stories. These Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained. (John Boorman's Excalibur is the most obvious exception and The Lord of the Rings was a cherished project of his that he was unable to get off the ground in the early Seventies.) The Two Towers can even stand the self-referential speech at the end by brave, honest hobbit Sam, about the force of mythic tales of good against evil, in which he wonders whether he would be worthy of figuring in such a saga himself. There is, along the way, as you might expect from a legendary tale, much topical resonance with references both fortuitous (two towers under attack) and expected (the belief that evil is abroad and that there are things worth fighting for) to current concerns. The movie, with narrative justification and commercial canniness, concludes with a cliffhanger that aims to have us sitting in the same seats a year hence to see how it all turns out in the concluding episode, The Return of the King. This is likely to be happier, more decisive and infinitely more satisfying than anything that will happen to our world in the next 12 months."
"Nov 12, 2014",positive," Like a mighty glacier on the move, a tripartite enterprise of such epic yearnings as Lord of the Rings needs time and patience for its impact to register. First time round, I was a sceptic. Such protracted introductions, so many characters, and what unpronounceable names .... I was not a happy fanof JRR Tolkien. But after a year's intermission, I emerged a convert from Part Two - shattered, shaken, stirred, even worshipful. It has a grandeur that it's not hyperbole to call Miltonic. Moreover, though it's no incitement to cinema-going, the film has collected a fearful dread from the way the world has gone since 9/11. Peter Jackson's film, unplanned though it was, now looks like a prophetic allegory for Osama bin Laden's messianic threats to world order as well as the besieged resistance of the great and the small. Even the sub-title The Two Towers involuntarily recalls the Twin Towers. Lines like ""A new power is coming, its victory is at hand"" or ""There will be no dawn for men"" or ""War is upon us"" have gained the resonance of fundamentalism that overlays cinematic fantasy. Fortunately, if the world is spared, it's the fantasy that will prevail. What an eyeful it is. This is probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible. Computergenerated imagery now adds its own genetic wonders to the elves, giants, humans and multispecies combatants. Tusked mastodons lumber over the field of battle with howdahs like minarets on their backs housing the avant-garde troops. A winged pterodactyl with a sinister cowled rider in the saddle flaps over the ramparts like a malevolent spotter aircraft. Wild boars as big and fierce as rampaging tigers attack the horse artillery. A huge dam splits asunder in a flood that makes Cecil B DeMille's famous parting of the Red Sea look like a piddling trickle. And then there's the final battle of Helm's Deep, the fortified keep of the King of Rohan that Saruman, the wicked wizard, puts to the siege ... Gustave Dore's great engravings of Paradise Lost look as if they've been given the gift of life as huge armies clash by night. You can believe that there are 10,000 men on screen at once. All manner of munitions, from land harpoons to scaling ladders 50-foot high and hung with invaders, reduce the implacable walls to rubble. New lands, new civilisations, new characters keep the fanciful parameters of Tolkien's world continually expanding into that private universe that constitutes the multi-part work's appeal. Probably, like me, you'll be groping through the first 20 minutes or so just to discover, or recall, who's who. Fear not. The story splits into four distinct parts as we follow each group of characters through a wonderland of necromancy where Graeco-Roman, Gothic, Pre-Raphaelite and Hollywood Medieval styles of culture and habitat all coexist with a bestiary of monsters and a pantheon of gods. Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin) push overland to destroy the baleful Ring that has cursed the world, and, en route, finally ensnare the skinny, near-naked Gollum that's been stalking them. This CGi creature is clearly a genetic relative of Star Wars' Yoda and a distant cousin of Harry Potter's Dobby. Completely computerised, though based on Andy Sergis's miming of his movements, he is a capering quadruped who, in return for sparing his life, leads them safely through a fearful swamp where dead warriors lie beneath the water - a Tennysonian image of eerie beauty. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the blond bowman elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) travel together and lift the dropsical curse placed on King Theoden (Bernard Hill) by the slimy enchanter Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). And as if all this weren't enough, Saruman (Christopher Lee) does his forecast of a Bin Laden figure as he sends his Uruk-hai legions marching into battle with a percussive tramp of iron-shod feet that is the film's most ominous keynote. The surprise guest in this extraordinary assortment, whose only common feature is their possession of more hairstyles than Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers could muster, turns out to be Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen). Last seen apparently spiralling to his doom in a bottomless pothole of flames, the wizard makes his comeback, unsinged and freshly laundered, in a whiter-than-white ensemble that alone strikes terror into the unwashed and unkempt enemies he confronts. If the mood of the movie is darker than Part One, and the stakes are higher, the story moves much more quickly from location to location. Admittedly, Tolkien's women, the Elf Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the Elf Princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), still defeat Jackson's attempt to animate their stained-glass radiance. But few will worry. With The Two Towers, Tolkien's tapestry of Middle Earth's battle for survival has achieved a majestic proportion, chivalric and quixotic, earthly and magical, an experience that reaches beyond the dimensions of the cinema screen and somehow reflects the global unease of the world in the first years of the 21st century."
"Nov 12, 2014",positive," Is this the longest computer game in cinematic history? The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom. Whenever you take a step toward the door, he cries: ""No, you must watch this bit, this really is amazing."" According to the distinguished critic Alexander Walker, the story ""moves much more quickly from location to location"" than in the first film. Since I left the cinema feeling as if I had got off a long-haul flight, I can only thank Providence that I missed part one. Certainly, the locations change from one slab of rock with a Lego castle and dry ice, to another. Perhaps this is to make up for the lack of movement in the characters. The only protagonist with any human range is Gollum, who is computer-animated. Equity must be getting nervous that an animated green house elf called Dobby is the star of Harry Potter and now Gollum is the only character worth watching in Lord of the Rings. More worrying than a geeky attachment to large armies and controlled explosions is the geo-political metaphor. The film is being described as a story for our times, post 9/11. I suppose Britain is where the hobbits come from and it is up to us to fight for Middle Earth. ""There is good in the world and it's worth fighting for,"" says Sam, the yokel hobbit. But after that, the metaphor becomes unsettling. Who are these hideous, alien races with terrible teeth? And what do walking trees have to do with it? I imagine that when male critics say they feel ""emotionally rewarded"" or even ""worshipful"" towards this film, it may be because men do rather well out of it. They look great in armour; they do not have to say much more than ""this is a good sword"" or ""let the battle begin""; they can fall off cliffs, wrestle with prehistoric beasts, fight off thousands of Orcs and remain shaven and unharmed. Women, on the other hand, are always being sent away. Liv Tyler floats off accompanied by folk music, and a spirited, if anaemic, blonde princess who takes a fancy to the warrior Aragorn (cue sword-play) is dispatched to a back passage with all the other toothless old women and grubby children. The dialogue is mystical and banal, the facial expressions stoned. And I cannot overemphasise the length of this film. It took Peter Jackson nearly six years to make the trilogy and you feel that you have been with him all the way. As The Two Towers lumbered towards its overblown climax, I shook my numb body and looked at my watch. The hobbits were heading towards a flame on the horizon, a little far off for my liking, but perhaps they could get a lift on one of those winged dinosaurs. The beautiful, brave menfolk were galloping over the hills. ""Are we nearly there yet?"" I asked my rapt 10-year-old son. Last year, I emerged from the preview of The Fellowship of the Ring with two principal thoughts: that this was the grandest, most spectacular piece of cinema I had ever seen; and that I would happily sit through it all over again. After watching the second instalment of the trilogy, The Two Towers, I had precisely the same response. What this film does is to repair the small faults of the first - the lengthy exposition, the humourless dialogue, the excess of hobbitish bucolia - and build on its strengths. The Two Towers feels even darker, grander and bolder than its predecessor; the pacing is braver; the fusion of real actors, animatronics and computer-generated imagery even more successful. Now, I should make two things clear. Although, as a child, I adored The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings trilogy - and, in particular The Two Towers - seemed too big, too flabby, too much of a good thing. What's more, although I like on-screen belligerence as much as the next man, I have always found epic battles a formless, impersonal turn-off. But only the most inveterate wimp could fail to be moved by the climactic battle between the defenders of Rohan and the legions of Uruk-hai, at Helm's Deep: it lifts you from your comfy, popcorn-encrusted seat and hurls you into another time, place, and existence. The build-up is long, the tension almost unbearable, but it is worth the wait. Under raging storm-clouds, the 10,000 invaders try to penetrate the stone fortress. With a hideous, Spielbergian thud, they march up to it en masse; they send 80-foot ladders up to the ramparts; they blow a gaping hole in the wall, sending 10-ton stones raining down upon their own men. By cutting between magnificent, digitally aided sweeping shots of the scene, and individual (and very bloody) deaths, the director Peter Jackson makes you both participant and observer in a fantastical battle that leaves you gasping for breath. There's so much else to enjoy: the (very human) exchanges between the various protagonists; the surprisingly touching central performances - and the sublime villains; and, in particular, Gollum, an extraordinarily rich all-digital character who reminds you that Dobby - who appears in the second Harry Potter film - was nothing but an irritating, one-dimensional nerd."
"Nov 12, 2014",positive," The big question is: is The Two Towers up to the standard set by The Fellowship of the Ring? I have to tell you that the answer is: no. It's better - more spectacular, more exciting, more emotionally rewarding.  Not only is this head and shoulders above the other films of 2002; it is going to inspire a whole new generation of moviegoers and film-makers with the magic that only the cinema can create. It's fabulous and fantastic, in the truest sense of those words.  Unlike the first film where the narrative followed one group of characters, the story here divides into three: Frodo and Sam's journey towards Mordor, guided by the potentially treacherous Gollum; Merry and Pippin's abduction by the Uruk-Hai and their encounter with the inhabitants of Fangorn forest; and the attempt by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli first to rescue Merry and Pippin, and then to save Rohan and its bewitched King from the forces of Saruman.  The climactic event of The Two Towers, the seemingly hopeless defence of Helm's Deep against insuperable odds, is an outstanding, extended battle sequence that dwarfs any others on celluloid; but that is only the greatest of many wonders.  Several other action sequences would have made spectacular climaxes for any other movie - especially the Warg attack on the emigrants from Rohan, and the Ents' angry storming of Isengard.  One of the greatest services director Peter Jackson and his team have done to Tolkien is to grasp the importance of landscape. Most of Tolkien's finest writing lay in his descriptions of Middle Earth itself. Digital technology has added to the natural, unspoiled marvels of New Zealand, and created a world at once fantastical and familiar.  One of the many excellent aspects of Jackson's script, co-written with his wife Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyers and Stephen Sinclair, is that it supplies comic and romantic relief to go with all the action and grandeur.  Neither comedy nor women were Tolkien's strong points; and these enhancements are part of the reason why the films are destined to reach an even wider and more appreciative audience than the books.  Especially astounding is Jackson's attention to directorial detail. Two of the moments which make the heart leap are when the elf Legolas (a) gets on a horse and (b) travels down a staircase. These events may not read like much on the page, but thanks to Jackson's imagination they amount to two of the most stirring moments ever seen.  Those killjoys who dismiss The Lord of the Rings as mere escapism should stop to consider whether its tale of racial hatred, genocide, the corrupting nature of power, the need to stand against evil and yet guard against the temptation of using extreme force, isn't of greater relevance to the world of today than most films of so-called realism.  Theoden, King of Rohan (an Oscarworthy supporting performance by Bernard Hill) has to decide between isolationism and involvement in a way that is relevant to several modern Western leaders, especially those in France and Germany.  King of the Elves (superbly played by Hugo Weaving), has to resolve whether his people-have any further responsibilities to the world they are shortly to leave behind.  Gollum - a stunning breakthrough in computer animation, and wonderfully voiced by Andy Serkis - has to decide between his doglike devotion to Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his feral determination to steal back his ring.  These ethical dilemmas are treated with sensitivity and seriousness. Yet the pace of the storytelling never flags. This is the speediest three hours in the cinema I have ever experienced.  The quality of the acting is amazingly high. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn easily dons the mantle of epic hero that used to be worn by Charlton Heston, and he's a lot sexier.  The triangular love relationship between him, Arwen (Liv Tyler, acting better in Elvish than she ever has in English) and Eowyn, Theoden's niece (played by the beautiful Miranda Otto) is deftly and delightfully done. The rise of post- war cynicism and the decline of the Western and the war film have not diminished the huge need in the popular cinema for heroes. In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there is a whole range of heroes for anybody to identify with.  I know a few people who felt distanced and bored by The Fellowship of the Ring, but I'm afraid the failure lies in their power to appreciate it, not in the film itself.  Necessarily darker and more violent than its predecessor, it may be too overwhelming for those under eight. For the rest of us, it's an overwhelming experience, in a totally positive way. "
"Nov 12, 2014",positive,"Much of the movie is exciting. But none of it is as satisfying as what Jackson was able to create in Fellowship, the first film."
"Nov 12, 2014",positive," Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, feels the increasing burden of the One Ring in the central film of the epic trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."" Without breaking stride, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" picks up briskly where last year's duly celebrated ""The Fellowship of the Rings,"" first chapter in director Peter Jackson's grandly ambitious adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's weighty literary trilogy, left off. Jackson presumably figured that no recap of the first chapter was needed to set this hotly anticipated new adventure off on its rousing, complicated way. And he's probably right since it appears only trolls in caves and the odd wandering Gollum are unfamiliar with Tolkien's deeply allegorical works, which have lately served as influence and inspiration for everyone from George Lucas and his ""Star Wars"" mythology on through J.K. Rowling and her wizard-laden Harry Potter books. ""The Two Towers,"" shot back-to-back with the first and third in Jackson's film trilogy, simply assumes moviegoers are up to speed and so plunges them without ceremony into the ongoing narrative that quickly veers off into three complex subplots. When last we saw young Hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), the reluctant Ringbearer, he was off with his spirited sidekick Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) into the wilds of Mordor to cast the cursed ring into the fires of hell. This film picks up their quest as the two Hobbits endure the harsh rigors of the journey and encounter a wily Gollum -- a mutated, reptilian Hobbit of the Stoor family -- who covets the ring as ""precious,"" but soon becomes their ally and unreliable guide. Another story thread tracks Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) as he travels with elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the blustery dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to aid the noble men of Rohan as they defend the fortress citadel Helm's Deep against marauding hordes of goonish orcs set loose by the evil white wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). A third storyline follows the captured Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) as they escape from the orcs and make their way through the Fangorn Forest. There, they ally with ancient talking-walking trees, led by the wizened, gnarled Treebeard (voiced by Rhys-Davies), to attack Saruman's stronghold of Isengard, where the villain has decimated the forest to fuel his rebel armies. Perhaps more aggressively than in the first film, Jackson (a New Zealander whose previous credits have ranged from the erratic horror outing ""The Frighteners"" to the chillingly good ""Heavenly Creatures"") reconfigures some of the book's plot elements, trims some scenes and characters, and transforms Tolkien's dense, image-heavy prose into a swift, brawny cinematic tale. Once again, the film runs nearly three hours, but for the most part it feels sharply focused and kinetic as it packs in just enough general exposition to inform non-readers while including plenty of smartly selective local color and arcane Tolkien lore to satisfy fans of the novels. On the technical side, Jackson's transition between films is seamless, and the sequel builds on the overall visual splendor of the first, with its painterly matte work and epic-scale set designs. In tone, this one is darker and more morose. It also might be argued that the battle scenes feel a bit overlong, overproduced and visually repetitive, but it's hard to argue with their thrilling impact. While the acting is once more solid throughout, even with the Shakespearean Ian McKellen given too little to do as the good wizard Gandalf, the most impressive performance of all comes from digital magicians who created the wretched Gollum, Smeagol (cunningly voiced by Andy Serkis). With his lizardly aspect, wispy grey hair and large expressive eyes, the tiny Smeagol is a feral creature of amazing comic and dramatic force. When he agonizes over his lowly plight or carries on schizophrenic dialogues between his inner angels and demons, he displays an amazing facility for expressing subtle emotions that puts some human actors in the shade. Surely it's the first time a computer-generated character has delivered such a truly gripping dramatic performance on screen. If the Oscar-nominated ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was a self-contained wonder, ""The Two Towers"" is more reliant on familiarity with the first film and Tolkien's vast lore. That rare moviegoer who's unfamiliar with either will be lost in the wilderness here. However, Jackson and company did such a stellar job of establishing their claim on Tolkien's legacy with last year's film, it's doubtful ""The Two Towers"" will fail to thrill and amaze with its art and technical craft. With adventure two now squarely on the screen and the essential ""Lord of the Rings"" saga well and two-thirds told, fans can slowly begin to look forward to a satisfying conclusion with the release of ""The Return of the King"" next holiday season. Once again, anticipation is sweet."
"Nov 12, 2014",negative," Is this the longest computer game in cinematic history? The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom. Whenever you take a step toward the door, he cries: ""No, you must watch this bit, this really is amazing."" According to the distinguished critic Alexander Walker, the story ""moves much more quickly from location to location"" than in the first film. Since I left the cinema feeling as if I had got off a long-haul flight, I can only thank Providence that I missed part one. Certainly, the locations change from one slab of rock with a Lego castle and dry ice, to another. Perhaps this is to make up for the lack of movement in the characters. The only protagonist with any human range is Gollum, who is computer-animated. Equity must be getting nervous that an animated green house elf called Dobby is the star of Harry Potter and now Gollum is the only character worth watching in Lord of the Rings. More worrying than a geeky attachment to large armies and controlled explosions is the geo-political metaphor. The film is being described as a story for our times, post 9/11. I suppose Britain is where the hobbits come from and it is up to us to fight for Middle Earth. ""There is good in the world and it's worth fighting for,"" says Sam, the yokel hobbit. But after that, the metaphor becomes unsettling. Who are these hideous, alien races with terrible teeth? And what do walking trees have to do with it? I imagine that when male critics say they feel ""emotionally rewarded"" or even ""worshipful"" towards this film, it may be because men do rather well out of it. They look great in armour; they do not have to say much more than ""this is a good sword"" or ""let the battle begin""; they can fall off cliffs, wrestle with prehistoric beasts, fight off thousands of Orcs and remain shaven and unharmed. Women, on the other hand, are always being sent away. Liv Tyler floats off accompanied by folk music, and a spirited, if anaemic, blonde princess who takes a fancy to the warrior Aragorn (cue sword-play) is dispatched to a back passage with all the other toothless old women and grubby children. The dialogue is mystical and banal, the facial expressions stoned. And I cannot overemphasise the length of this film. It took Peter Jackson nearly six years to make the trilogy and you feel that you have been with him all the way. As The Two Towers lumbered towards its overblown climax, I shook my numb body and looked at my watch. The hobbits were heading towards a flame on the horizon, a little far off for my liking, but perhaps they could get a lift on one of those winged dinosaurs. The beautiful, brave menfolk were galloping over the hills. ""Are we nearly there yet?"" I asked my rapt 10-year-old son. Last year, I emerged from the preview of The Fellowship of the Ring with two principal thoughts: that this was the grandest, most spectacular piece of cinema I had ever seen; and that I would happily sit through it all over again. After watching the second instalment of the trilogy, The Two Towers, I had precisely the same response. What this film does is to repair the small faults of the first - the lengthy exposition, the humourless dialogue, the excess of hobbitish bucolia - and build on its strengths. The Two Towers feels even darker, grander and bolder than its predecessor; the pacing is braver; the fusion of real actors, animatronics and computer-generated imagery even more successful. Now, I should make two things clear. Although, as a child, I adored The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings trilogy - and, in particular The Two Towers - seemed too big, too flabby, too much of a good thing. What's more, although I like on-screen belligerence as much as the next man, I have always found epic battles a formless, impersonal turn-off. But only the most inveterate wimp could fail to be moved by the climactic battle between the defenders of Rohan and the legions of Uruk-hai, at Helm's Deep: it lifts you from your comfy, popcorn-encrusted seat and hurls you into another time, place, and existence. The build-up is long, the tension almost unbearable, but it is worth the wait. Under raging storm-clouds, the 10,000 invaders try to penetrate the stone fortress. With a hideous, Spielbergian thud, they march up to it en masse; they send 80-foot ladders up to the ramparts; they blow a gaping hole in the wall, sending 10-ton stones raining down upon their own men. By cutting between magnificent, digitally aided sweeping shots of the scene, and individual (and very bloody) deaths, the director Peter Jackson makes you both participant and observer in a fantastical battle that leaves you gasping for breath. There's so much else to enjoy: the (very human) exchanges between the various protagonists; the surprisingly touching central performances - and the sublime villains; and, in particular, Gollum, an extraordinarily rich all-digital character who reminds you that Dobby - who appears in the second Harry Potter film - was nothing but an irritating, one-dimensional nerd."
"Nov 12, 2014",positive,"While some people think this surpasses the original, I don't. The storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on... but the positives are many."
"Nov 12, 2014",positive," What are the Ents going to look like? That's the anticipatory cringe for any Tolkien fan faced with a film version of The Two Towers. The corresponding question in The Fellowship of the Ring – how on earth will they tackle wacky old Tom Bombadil? – was dealt with by simple excision, but the Ents are too central to the story to omit. It's perfectly possible to read The Lord of the Rings believing in Treebeard without ever having visualised him (is he an anthropomorphic tree, or a dendromorphic man?). There are a controlled number of humorous situations in this mostly very grim film, but any whiff of whimsy or silliness, like a fart at High Mass, would swiftly dispel the magic. So it's a relief to report that striding, creaking Treebeard, with his Archimboldo face composed of boles and mosses, is a satisfying creation: comical in his slowness, but also wise, and frightening. That Tolkienian note of holy awe, mixed with rustic humour, is very hard to pull off. Though the action in this second part of the trilogy moves decisively towards the world of men, the many ways of being not-human are fully explored. Problems of visualisation aside, the fundamental question at this half-way point is whether the director, Peter Jackson, can create an artistic whole out of the middle of the sandwich. Will the magnificent filling, pressed on both sides by the great crusts of ""the quest begins"" and ""the quest is ended"", just seem shapeless? No, the film is triumphant on its own terms. The narrative has an unstoppable forward thrust – it's not just a question, as in the Harry Potter sequel, of returning to a place we know and renewing our acquaintance with the strange folk there. The sundered Fellowship, split into three, pushes like a trident deeper into new and dangerous territory. For the first half of the original book, the reader is left in the dark about the fate of Sam and Frodo. They have disappeared from the text and from our ken, and when they next appear they seem isolated and scared. Jackson opts for a less daring, more conventionally cinematic way of telling the story, cutting rapidly between all three segments at once. This was perhaps an inevitable choice, and it certainly gives the action a reassuring narrative flow, but the effect is to leach much of the despair and loneliness out of the Hobbits' quest. Tolkien's great skill is to make you think, no matter how many times you re-read his book, that perhaps this time it won't work out after all. The message of the second book is There is no hope (but let's try anyway), and Jackson is faithful to this, but the wham-bam style of epic works against him. Jackson makes other artistic choices at variance with the book, but they rarely feel like violations. Most of them make you reassess the story, draw your attention to unnoticed subtleties. A few of the characters seem even richer, more profound than Tolkien's own conception. Viggo Mortensen finds an astonishing stillness and poise at the heart of Aragorn (he's a bit of a stiff in the novel). This deep love of peace is what drives him to fight, a paradox which makes him more kinglike than any other character. In brief divergence from the book, he's reunited, in memory or dream, with Arwen (is Liv Tyler's spade-like face actually getting longer with each instalment?). This lovely interlude softens the character, redresses an awkwardness in Tolkien, and breaks up the relentless militarism. Elijah Wood (Frodo) is visibly losing life force as the quest continues; drooping, swooning, a spooked and spooky figure. Gollum is a wonderful creation: voiced by Andy Serkis, and given the most heartbreakingly expressive face, he's far more than a digital effect: he's really there, taking up space, displacing air (part of the impact comes from the meticulous care with which all the creatures of Middle Earth are scaled relative to one another). Gollum is a vile mixture of servility and malice, yet watching him being beaten, throttled, kicked by almost everyone he encounters is as distressing as watching a child being hit. Frodo, for all his faults, is kind to Gollum, seeing in him his own disturbing likeness; Sam, for all his virtues, is cruel. Gollum has been corrupted by his ""precioussss"", but Jackson strikes an almost theological note in suggesting that his self-centred inability to forgive is really what's corroding him. There are several hazards which Jackson avoids. This episode, with its histrionic battle scenes and Viking fetishism, Middle Earth having a simultaneous bad hair day, could have degenerated into a heavy metal video aesthetic. As it is, only Faramir's shaggy perm seriously enters Spinal Tap territory. Another error would have been to make this a kind of postmodern pot-pourri of cinematic in-jokes. When Aragorn – missing, presumed very dead – turns up late for a battle, all Legolas (Orlando Bloom) says is: ""You're late."" That this hoary old line is delivered in Elvish redeems it. Gimli is reduced to a comic character – there's another discussion of when it's permissible to ""toss a dwarf"" – but there's otherwise nothing camp or arch to leaven the tense moral seriousness. The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too."
"Nov 19, 2013",positive," As the opening credits of 2003 begin to roll, two big thunderers are slugging it out. ""Chicago"" is a musical and ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is three hours of epic; the garter belt is to one film what the horned helmet is to the other, although I shall not slake your curiosity by revealing which is which. Both films are to be commended for venturing into genres that were until recently viewed as dilapidated, vacant, and overpriced. All we need now is the return of the religious barnstormer, and the revival will be complete. Even as we speak, Ben Affleck may be combing his beard for the leading role of Jonah, with Nathan Lane as the whale. ""Chicago"" stars Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly and Renée Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Each is a man-killer, and each resides in jail, plotting her defense with the silken legal help of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). The time is, I would guess, the late nineteen-twenties, although the setting is so stylized, so shamelessly grounded in a hundred other shows and films, that ""Chicago"" barely qualifies as a period piece; indeed, it merrily jabs at the celebrity-lust of our own era. In the strongest and most biting number, Roxie perches on Billy's lap like a dummy—limbs turned to sticks, spots of red on her rounded cheeks—and chants the melodies that he, the attorney as ventriloquist, feeds into her mouth. Behind them, the ladies and gentlemen of the press jerk on wires, yanked from on high by a second Billy, and compete to do his bidding. As a musical demonstration of spin, it couldn't be meaner. The only hitch is that I cannot for the life of me name that tune. The songs in ""Chicago"" crash in one ear, barge around your brain for a minute or two, then make a swift exit through the other ear, never to be heard again. This may mark me as a Rodgers and Hammerstein junkie, but I can't help feeling that the fustiness lies with Kander and Ebb, whose music and lyrics operate on the old-fashioned principle that every song should be a showstopper, regardless of whether the show deserves to be stopped. As I left the movie, my skull was humming more than I was; much violence is perpetrated in the course of the plot, as each of the jailbirds recounts her capital offense, but the real harm is done to the senses of the people in the audience, who will find themselves in the unusual position of being snarled up in fishnets and assaulted by sequins. Is there anything, in art or in life, less sexy than the incorrigible, twenty-four-hour desire to trumpet one's sexiness to the world? We are meant to be blown away by the sultry airs of this picture, but the very surfeit of them spoils the plan. When Cyd Charisse laid an endless leg across the screen in the ""Broadway Ballet"" sequence of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" or when she and Fred Astaire offered a tribute to Mickey Spillane in ""The Band Wagon,"" we understood that the hardboiled style was already a soft target, and that the landscape of gumshoes, pimps, and dames with Louise Brooks hair styles had become a nice, pliable gag for choreographers. Yet here comes ""Chicago,"" almost half a century later, kitting its heroine out with a black bob and inviting us to take our randy noir straight up. Rob Marshall, the director, does his best to leave the stage show behind, but the cards are stacked against him, for ""Chicago"" is a pack of theatrical tricks. Whether it's the towering grid of prison bars or the huge red ""Roxie"" that flashes behind Renée Zellweger, we sense a flatness of dimension, a reluctance to stretch the story's depth of field. What Marshall does, by way of compensation, is to edit his way out of trouble, cutting away furiously during not only each song but almost every line of each song, as though not daring to presume that younger viewers will be able to stomach more than four and a half seconds of inviolate music. This is hectic on the eye and bad for the confidence; we start to wonder, ungallantly, about the camera's chronic wish to glance aside—could it be that the performers might not weather its unstinting gaze? A head-on scene of Gene Kelly tap-dancing is bliss, but the same view of Richard Gere is not kind. This is hardly Gere's fault; no skill is more baffling than tap—how can the staccato turn largo and liquid like that? Gere also strips to his underwear; whether he does this in the interests of gender equality or whether, for a practicing Buddhist, it is an established spiritual technique for paring life down to its essentials, I am not qualified to judge. The only player to conquer ""Chicago"" is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is no Charisse in her motions but who gets by on a full tank of unleaded oomph. The film is hard, however, on Renée Zellweger. If there is any living star who could strap herself into heels like scalpels and then strut and bray, all by her lonesome, against a background of inky black, with the camera hunkered down ringside so that it can peer up her shimmering nano-dress, I can't name her. Many people will get off on the highs of this picture, but they might want to ask why there are no other levels. Musicals depend on the contest of innocence and experience, and we are just not culturally equipped to provide that mix anymore. Lovers of the classic form were prepared to believe that it was natural—more of a thirsty emotional need than a luxury—for a character to break into song, whereas nowadays that perversity has to be explained. Most of the numbers in ""Chicago"" are meant to unfurl within Roxie's imagination, and even then you can hear the grinding gear change as the action readies itself for a tune. I admire the punch of this movie, but not for a second, as the dancers wriggled and raged, did I get that delicious, redeeming sense that life can be lived on the hoof. Once you have clambered over the craggy title, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a fairly easy ride. Never in three hours did I look at my watch, nor cast my eyes toward the sun as it westered unto the havens of Eriador. Around me rose a few clucks from confirmed Tolkienites, frustrated at the loss of a favorite line from the novel. Were the movie to map every detail of the Master's work, though, the result would not be three hours long. It would be three years long. In the event, the director, Peter Jackson, has crunched and tidied the book. Hundreds of pages pass, for example, in which the author allots so much space to Gimli (a dwarf), Legolas (an elf), and Aragorn (a real man) that we all but forget about Frodo and Sam, the hobbits bearing the Ring to its doom—in a volcano handily named Mount Doom, which must make it easy to ask for directions. Onscreen, Jackson braids the two strands together, adding the tale of fellow-hobbits Merry and Pippin, who, in a twist guaranteed to make environmentalists spill their carrot juice for joy, are literally hugged by trees. We also get flying dragons, a breathless opening sequence in which Gandalf (Ian McKellen) plummets down a belching abyss, and a flawless white horse that, if you give a little whistle, gallops in from nowhere, though only in slow motion. And lo, the name of this steed is Shadowfax, or, as it was told in the olden tongue, Palmpilot. Then, there is Gollum. Gollum, who guides Frodo on his quest, is white-skinned and blue-veined, like a moldering cheese, and his shrunken frame is topped by a triangular head with protruding eyes. Think of Ross Perot after ten years on the Atkins diet, and you're almost there. There are two problems with Gollum, who used to be known as Sméagol before he entered the witness-protection program. First, he gives the movie a chance for psychological inquiry—the one thing it doesn't require. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is an epic, and one of the defining restrictions—not to say pleasures—of epic is that it both predate and outwit psychology. Motives, good and ill, may be thwarted or confounded, but you don't read Tolkien for the niceties of tangled minds; you read him for pace and wonder, and the virtues of Jackson's trilogy, thus far, have been pace and astonishment, which is almost the same thing. Second, Gollum was forged on computer and planted inside the frame. Nobody could quibble with the vitality of the result, but there's the rub—his creators are so pleased with their baby that they can't help showing him off, and we get far more of his hisses and writhings than we need. This is a pity, and we may have to accept that, for those fooling around with brand-new technologies, the toys are simply too much fun. When you are the kind of exuberant artist, as Jackson is, who visualizes a giant tree that can both walk the walk and talk the talk, you can hardly be blamed if, in the deepest sense, you end up rooting for it.

"Nov 19, 2013",positive," Last year's The Fellowship Of The Ring, director Peter Jackson's first entry in his three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, provided little cause for complaint. At once thoroughly cinematic and faithful to the spirit (if not always the letter) of Tolkien's book, it presented Middle Earth as an immersive experience, a world in which every aspect is realized in minute detail. Fellowship made the impossible believable, and without draining the magical happenings, fantastical locations, and uncanny creatures of their wonder, it also never abandoned a sense of dramatic and thematic weight. As embodied by a well-chosen cast, Fellowship's characters had all the depth Tolkien gave them on the page (and sometimes more), and their quest to rid the world of a ring of absolutely corrupting power took on greater urgency as the film progressed toward a cliffhanger that set up its second part. To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor–and, astoundingly, it's better. That's not simply a matter of exposition giving way to action, although the film has plenty, as soulful hobbits Elijah Wood and Sean Astin make their way toward Mordor, friends Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan find unlikely allies deep in a forest, and the dwarf/elf/human team of John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Viggo Mortensen attempts to defend a struggling kingdom from the forces of Christopher Lee. What makes Towers so staggering is the way it brings the full scope of Jackson's adaptation into focus. Without missing a beat in three hours, the film shifts from epic to lyrical and back. It portrays a harrowingly intense battle one moment, then pauses for a father's grief over his son's death the next. It shows in frightening detail the engines of war, then links those engines to the bloodshed they exact and the ecological destruction that made them possible. What Fellowship suggested, Towers elucidates. It's thrilling as swords clash and arrows fly, but it also never abandons the underlying sadness of Tolkien's world, in which each victory only forestalls the transition to a meaner age. (And, for all the attendant technophobia, it's another technical masterpiece. Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, may qualify as the first fully fleshed-out performance by a CGI effect.) Next year, The Return Of The King will bring the story to a close. Until then, it feels almost like a privilege to watch the unfolding of a tale from a fantastic imagined past rich with resonance for the human present. "
"Nov 19, 2013",positive," ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" fits this pattern, taking Frodo Baggins into territory more frightening than anything he encountered in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" last year. ""The Two Towers,"" was made at the same time and woven from the same cloth as the other chapters in Peter Jackson's ambitious ""Rings"" project. The similarity of the three movies - the third opens next winter - will disappoint viewers looking for something different each time. But it ensures huge dividends for the filmmakers, now that the first installment has proved an over-the-top hit, with worldwide grosses of $860 million to date. I found ""Fellowship of the Ring"" pale compared with the imaginative sweep of Tolkien's books. Few readers agreed with me - you should see the angry mail I got - so I'm pleased to report that ""The Two Towers"" is better. One reason is Gollum, who dogs Frodo's trail because of his obsession with the magical ring Frodo is taking to Mordor so it can be destroyed before Sauron uses it to dominate Middle Earth forever. Gollum is treacherous and wicked, but he's also weak and pitiable. Jackson evokes these contradictory traits through one of the most ingenious computer-generated characters yet created. There's no need for the ponderous exposition that weighed down the first installment, since the filmmakers assume we've seen it. They give ""Towers"" a snappier ending, too, straining less hard to make it seem like both a single installment and a complete story in itself. The flat dialogue doesn't give the actors much to work with, but Liv Tyler and Ian McKellen make strong impressions. And then there's Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, whose live performance was the basis for the computer graphics. Most moviegoers will leave buzzing about the climactic Battle of Helm's Deep. But in my eyes, this is Gollum's show more than anyone else's, even the special-effects wizards behind the scenes."

"Sep 13, 2012",positive," THE ARISTOCATS (1970) / THE RESCUERS (1977) / THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (1990) / POCAHONTAS (1995). Before the disastrous Aughts, was there a worse decade for Disney animated features than the 1970s? Even the relatively bare '60s had the marvelous 101 Dalmatians to elevate its average, and the 1980s was largely saved by the last-minute appearance of 1989's The Little Mermaid, which of course launched a new golden age of Disney classics. The '70s began with The Aristocats, a limp Lady and the Tramp reworking that finds Eva Gabor voicing the pampered Duchess and Phil Harris speaking for the street-savvy O'Malley. Duchess and her kittens will inherit the fortune of their wealthy owner after she passes away, a development that leads the woman's butler to get rid of the felines so that he will inherit as the secondary beneficiary. O'Malley and his band of jazz-playing alley cats come to their rescue, as do assorted other animals. But except for a pair of country hounds named Napoleon and Lafayette, these critters are alternately irritating (a mouse, two geese) or downright dull (a horse). The ""Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat"" sequence is a showstopper, and the butler's run-ins with the dawgs are amusing, but this is otherwise forgettable stuff. I'll go ahead and acknowledge that I'm probably in the minority when it comes to The Rescuers. A sizable box office success all over the world — it reportedly made more than the same year's Star Wars in some countries — it's since been a popular seller on VHS and DVD and will likely fare well on Blu-ray as well. Yet the movie moves like molasses, as the heroic mice Bernard (voiced by Bob Newhart) and Bianca (Eva Gabor again) square off against the fearsome Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page) in order to rescue the orphan girl Penny from her clutches. There's some colorful action set in the aptly named Devil's Bayou, and I dug the character of Evinrude the dragonfly. But the songs aren't up to par (nevertheless, ""Someone's Waiting for You"" earned a Best Original Song Oscar nomination), Madame Medusa comes off as a cut-rate Cruella De Vil (no surprise, since the 101 Dalmatians villainess was at one point discussed for this picture), and Newhart's Bernard ranks as one of Disney's dullest toon protagonists. The Rescuers was the first Disney toon flick to inspire a sequel, and the good news is that The Rescuers Down Under is better than its predecessor. Here, Bernard and Bianca travel to Australia to rescue a boy who's being held captive by a poacher intent on nailing an eagle that the lad has befriended. The film's Aussie setting (unusual for an animated film) adds some interest, as do the spirited vocal characterizations by George C. Scott as the ruthless poacher and John Candy as a friendly albatross. Although it was released in the year between The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, it's never been considered part of the Disney renaissance, and its limp box office helped convince the studio to release all future sequels straight to the home market. Alongside all these underachievers, Disney has thankfully chosen to release one winner to Blu-ray. Pocahontas tells the story of the real-life Native American heroine (voiced by Irene Bedard, with Judy Kuhn handling the songs) and her (fictionalized) romance with British sea captain John Smith (Mel Gibson). If nothing else, the movie features my all-time favorite Disney tune: the gorgeous, Oscar-winning ""Colors of the Wind,"" at once timeless (in its hopeful theme of harmony among all creatures as well as with nature itself) and timely (the line ""You think the only people who are people are the people who think and look like you"" should be the catchphrase for every Republican National Convention). Yet the movie has other virtues as well: an Oscar-winning score by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, ofttimes staggering animation, and appreciated (but not obtrusive) comic relief from a mischievous raccoon named Meeko. The Aristocats is sold individually, while The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under are paired in one set. Pocahontas unfortunately shares its edition with the 1998 straight-to-video sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World. Blu-ray extras on The Aristocats include the deleted song ""She Never Felt Alone""; a piece on songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman; a music video for ""Oui Oui Marie""; and the Minnie Mouse cartoon Bath Day. Blu-ray extras on the Rescuers twofer include the deleted song ""Peoplitis""; a Rescuers Down Under making-of featurette; the live-action short Water Birds; and the animated short The Three Blind Mouseketeers. Blu-ray extras on Pocahontas include the deleted song ""If I Never Knew You""; deleted scenes; a featurette on the music; and the animated short Little Hiawatha. BATTLESHIP (2012). This massively budgeted, heavily hyped and supremely awful summer flop could easily be mistaken for a Transformers sequel except that it's missing Shia LaBeouf's distinct hairdo. Peter Berg, who used to be a mediocre actor before morphing into a mediocre director, apparently wants to be the new Michael Bay (oh, for a time when filmmakers looked up to Hitchcock and Hawks instead!), and I guess give him credit for succeeding. With awful dialogue, dull characterizations and snooze-inducing visual effects — yeah, I'm not so proud that I can't admit to uncharacteristically dozing off for a few minutes during one of the endless battle sequences — Battleship is the sort of mindless mayhem that's defended by fans as ""perfect popcorn entertainment."" Sure, if you like your popcorn burnt and sticking to the bag. But to tag this a worthy blockbuster is the equivalent of spitting in the faces of Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, James Cameron or any other filmmaker who used to expertly do this sort of thing on a regular basis. A virtual remake of last year's piss-poor Battle: Los Angeles, this adds aliens to the board game template, with our military might going up against dastardly e.t.'s bent on destroying the world — or, more importantly, the American way of life. Battleship was a massive bomb at the U.S. box office (it did just fine internationally), but it might fare better at home, since it's jingoistic nonsense that shamelessly panders to every demographic — teen boys will ogle at the special effects (and at former Charlottean Brooklyn Decker), young women will dig hunks Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgard (playing unlikely brothers), R&B fans will be excited at the prospect of Rihanna making her film debut (the verdict: meh), and older viewers who should know better will feel all warm and faux-patriotic when the film drags out geriatric naval officers to help fight the invaders. As far as I know, this is only the second movie that's been based on a board game, with Clue having paved the way back in 1985. Let's hope they wait another 27 years before bringing a third one to the screen — it'll take that long to mentally prepare myself for a celluloid take on Hungry Hungry Hippos or Parcheesi. Blu-ray extras include video commentary by Berg; an alternate ending previsualization; a featurette on the visual effects; looks at shooting at sea and on the USS Missouri; a tour of the USS Missouri; and a short piece on the cast. BERNIE (2012). Bernie finds Jack Black playing the same type of character essayed by Zach Galifianakis in The Campaign: a friendly, respectable and slightly effeminate Southerner who's greatly admired by those around him. The difference, though, is that The Campaign is a fictional piece while Bernie is based on a true story. Working from a Texas Monthly article by Skip Hollandsworth, director Richard Linklater re-teams with his The School of Rock star for this quirky piece about Bernie Tiede, a mortician residing in the town of Carthage, Texas. Bernie's method of treating everyone with courtesy and respect extends to Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), a loathsome widow with no friends but lots of material wealth. Bernie strikes up a friendship (or something more?) with the elderly woman and they soon become inseparable, which is fine until Bernie starts to feel more like Marjorie's possession than her BFF. But does he emotionally break down enough to kill her in a second of spontaneous and regrettable rage, or was he planning to murder her all along so that he may enjoy her riches? The sympathetic townspeople opt for the former; the local district attorney (Matthew McConaughey) votes for the latter. Writing the screenplay with Hollandsworth, Linklater uses dollops of black humor to provide an edge to this morally ambiguous piece that asks viewers to weigh not only whether one awful deed can overshadow a lifetime of charitable service but also whether there was any appropriate punishment that would suit this particular crime. (This is assuming the real-life Bernie is as likable as his celluloid counterpart; as filmed, Linklater is clearly on his side.) MacLaine and McConaughey are only required to strike the same note repeatedly (grouchy and grandstanding, respectively), but Black is excellent in the central role. Incidentally, the real Bernie Tiede pops up during the closing credits. Blu-ray extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette; deleted scenes; a piece on the true-life story that inspired the film; and a look at the Carthage residents through interviews and audition pieces. THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT (2012). It would be both obnoxious and inaccurate to quip that The Five-Year Engagement feels as if it runs as long as the titular length, but there's no denying that this is one movie that would have benefitted from some judicious trimming in the editing room. At 125 minutes, the latest comedy from the director (Nicholas Stoller), star (Jason Segel) and producer (who else but Judd Apatow) of the superior Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't sound especially long — it's the exact same running time as the Apatow-produced Bridesmaids, which was the perfect length. Yet by unleashing most of its best gags during the first act, and by sprinkling its dramatic moments around like a sous chef adding just a soupcon of parsley to an order of grilled trout, that leaves plenty of time for the film to develop a noticeable sag around the middle. Speaking of sous chefs, that's the role essayed by Segel: He plays Tom Solomon, a highly respected member of San Francisco's culinary scene. His girlfriend is Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt), and it's only after he pops the question that Violet is beckoned to the University of Michigan for a postdoctoral position. Deciding to put his own career on hold while she builds hers, Tom agrees with Violet that they should postpone the wedding for two years and move to Ann Arbor. Tom, who can only find work at a deli, hates living there, and when it looks like the two years might stretch into something longer, he loses it in rather imaginative fashion. The late film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the popular Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers pairing, ""He gave her class and she gave him sex."" In this film, Blunt provides both the class and the sex, but Segel nevertheless brings enough easygoing charisma and sly wit to the table to make them a believable screen couple. While this is evident in the scenes in which they make doe eyes at each other, it's crucially also identifiable in the sequences in which their characters are at odds with each other. There's a terrific bit in which the two argue in bed, replete with the sort of acidic asides, frustrated exchanges and oddly understandable oxymorons (""I want to be alone ... with you here!"" — a great line) that spring from real life. Scenes like this make the lowbrow moments even more unworthy of inclusion here, whether it's the sight of Violet getting walloped by an opening car door or the increasingly tedious banter between Violet's colleagues at the university. If they had kept all the drama and halved the humor, The Five-Year Engagement would have truly distinguished itself. As it stands, it's engaging but hardly revelatory. The Blu-ray includes both the PG-13 theatrical version and an unrated cut. Extras include audio commentary by Stoller, Segel, Blunt, co-stars Chris Pratt and Alison Brie, and producer Rodney Rothman; a making-of featurette; deleted scenes; extended and alternate scenes; and a gag reel. LA GRANDE ILLUSION (1937). In the latest edition of the decennial Sight & Sound poll, this Jean Renoir classic placed 73rd on the list of the all-time greatest films, even securing top-10 standing on the individual lists submitted by Woody Allen, Mike Newell and a few other participants. Such reverential treatment is nothing new, of course: Back in 1952, both Orson Welles (you know, that Citizen Kane guy) and David Lean (you know, that Lawrence of Arabia helmer) cited the movie as one of their 10 all-time favorite films. Still, not everyone was a fan: Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's rat-faced Minister of Propaganda, declared it ""Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1"" and ordered all available prints destroyed. Further WWII shenanigans resulted in the belief that the original negative was lost, requiring Renoir to use inferior stock for a 1958 release. What no one knew at the time was that the original was safely stored in a Russian vault, and it wasn't until it made its trip back to its native France (where it sat unnoticed for years) that it was finally re-released at its initial length (113 minutes as opposed to the widely distributed 94-minute cut) in 1999. As part of its StudioCanal Collection, Lionsgate has now released it on Blu-ray in a pristine edition sure to delight cinephiles across the country. Set during World War I, the film focuses on three French soldiers — the working-class Lieutenant Marechal (Jean Gabin), the Jewish, middle-class Lieutenant Rosenthal (Dalio) and the aristocratic Captain de Boeldieu (Dita Parlo) — who get captured and spend time in a pair of German prison camps. The second of these prisons is overseen by Captain von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim, commanding in both senses of the word), who feels a special kinship with his upper-class equal, de Boeldieu. So beautifully realized and deeply felt that its title can mean different things to different people (for starters, the grand illusion can be that war solves anything, that the well-bred aristocracy will survive such a brutal conflict, or that the lines that divide classes, races and countries can ever be erased), the movie pushes Renoir's humanist views without having to resort to any manufactured sentiment or cheap theatrics. In short, it's as honest as it is humbling. La Grande Illusion became the first foreign-language film to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. In modern times, it has the distinction of being the very first title released by the prestigious Criterion Collection on DVD (in 1999). Yet it's this beautifully restored Blu-ray edition that will doubtless remain the definitive home edition. Blu-ray extras include a piece in which Renoir expert Olivier Curchod discusses the film's history and controversy; a discussion about the movie with film professor and critic Ginette Vincendeau; a featurette on the remarkable tale behind the discovery of the original negative; a look at the restoration; and the theatrical trailers from 1937 and 1958. THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY: EXTENDED EDITIONS (2001-2003). Last summer saw the Blu-ray debut of the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in one massive box set, so now we get the inevitable release of the movies individually. Of course, given the lengths of the films and the ample amount of extra features accompanying each title, that still translates into a five-disc edition per feature. Between a mountain of critical raves, a $314 million box office haul, and 13 Oscar nominations (resulting in four wins), the colossal success of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) initially caught even ardent admirers of J.R.R. Tolkien's literary trilogy off guard. After having filmed all three parts of the trilogy in one fell swoop (an enormous risk on the part of New Line Cinemas), director Peter Jackson got things off to a roaring start with a fantasy flick that pleased both fans and novices alike. Even those who haven't read the books are doubtless familiar with the saga's basic thrust — noble Middle-earth denizens must destroy a powerful ring before it falls into the hands of an evil warlord — but to their credit, Jackson and his co-scripters kick things off with a helpful prologue that nicely sets up the story. From there, Jackson juggles a daunting array of conflicts and characters (Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf is the cast standout), and it's to his credit that the saga leaves viewers panting for more. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) doesn't quite match the majesty of its predecessor, though that's hardly meant as a knock against a rousing, far-reaching spectacle of unlimited ambition. But whereas Fellowship did a nice job of balancing quieter moments with the bombast, this action-packed installment often treats its expository scenes as asides (too many good actors — McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Miranda Otto — are given the short shrift in this outing); what's more, the movie doesn't deepen or expand the tale's themes as masterfully as The Empire Strikes Back added to Star Wars' mystique. But as a stirring story of unsullied heroism, it's a winner, and as an action epic, it features some of the best battle sequences of recent vintage. And while the campaign to win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for Andy Serkis (voicing the CGI-created Gollum) proved to be a fizzle, he turns out to be the best special effect in a movie crammed with them. This was the Oscar weakling of the bunch, earning two awards out of six nominations, although no one at New Line was complaining about its sizable $341 million gross. Pulling off a successful three-peat, Jackson wraps up Tolkien's fantasy saga with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), a dazzling chapter that outgrossed its predecessors ($377 million domestically and over one billion internationally) and led to Oscar overkill when the myopic Academy handed it 11-out-of-11 awards (four or five would have been more reasonable), including Best Picture. With the heftiest running time of all three extended editions, this installment is long but not necessarily overlong — even the battle sequences have been executed with more focus and clarity than those in Two Towers. The super-sized length also allows several members of the large cast to strut their stuff, and several new creatures, from an army of ghostly marauders to a gigantic spider in the best Harryhausen tradition, are staggering to behold. Ultimately, though, this final act belongs to the ring-bearer and his equally diminutive companions. The odyssey of the Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), his faithful companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum contains the true heart of the film, evoking all sorts of emotions as we watch each player constantly forced to make painful decisions and struggle with their own tortured psyches. This is a movie of expensive visual effects and expansive battle scenes, but when it comes to truly making its mark, we have to thank all the little people. The sound and picture quality on the DVDs were so spectacular that (is this blasphemy?) I enjoyed the series even more at home than in the theater — on the big screen, this ambitious undertaking occasionally felt distant, but on disc it exuded more warmth, coming off as the best mini-series never made. On Blu-ray, the sights are even more astounding, and the sound is equally fantastic (better check the living room wall for fissures after cranking this baby). In addition to the extended cuts of all three pictures (running around four hours apiece), each five-disc set also includes hours of bonus material (roughly seven hours on Fellowship, nine on Towers and 10 on King). Notable among the inclusions are the much-ballyhooed, behind-the-scenes documentaries created by Costa Botes, who was given complete set access by Jackson. Other extras include four separate audio commentaries on each film (over 30 participants, including Jackson and most of the principal cast members); 44 featurettes covering practically every aspect of production except for catering (and that might be buried in there somewhere); interactive maps of Middle-earth; and photo galleries containing over 4,000 images."
"Dec 9, 2011",positive,"The Two Towers, then, is the greatest blockbuster ever made without either a beginning or an end, a feisty beast with a hollow ring in its bones."
"Jun 21, 2011",positive," The second chapter of Peter Jackson’s landmark epic, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,” differs in narrative and tone from the first one, “”The Fellowship of the Ring.” In this middle segment, the emphasis is more on battles and action set-pieces than on plot or character development.  “The Two Towers,” impressive as it is technically, feels like a middle chapter, mediating between the protags of the first film and the events they would encounter in the third and last one. In their parallel journeys, the Fellowship stands against the powerful forces spreading from the Two Towers, Orthanc Tower in Isengard, where Saruman has bred a lethal army of 10,000 strong; and Sauron’s fortress at Barad-dûr, deep within the dark lands of Mordor. In mood and visuals, “The Two Towers” is darker and more somber than “Fellowship of the Ring,” plunging Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) into an environment of war and waste. Frodo must destroy the malevolent ring of power in the burning area of Mount Doom before it falls into evil hands.  Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis), who had once possessed the ring, offers to guide them. Meanwhile, the band is split, and fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are held captive by the awful Uruk-bai, the warrior beasts created by the wicked wizard Saruman (vet Christopher Lee, in a part that fits him like a silk glove). In yet another site, the warrior Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) and his buddies, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (handsomer Orlando Bloom), are on their way to the Kingdom of Rohan, which means they have to face the Uruk-hai military. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers culminates in the astonishing battle for the refuge, Helm’s Deep, the Kingdom of Rohan’s ancient large stone fortress, besieged by Uruk-hai warriors. To fully understand “The Two Towers,” it’s crucial to watch the first film as some of that film’s characters reappear briefly, while others are new to the saga, such as princess Eowyn (Mirando Otto), who becomes Aragon’s romantic interest. The Oscar-winning franchise arrived on Blu-ray Disc for the first time on April 6, 2010. It contains the original theatrical versions of the three films with more than 7 hours of special features. The Oscar-winning The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, one of the most spectacular epic adventures in film history, can now be seen as never before when all three of Peter Jackson’s visual masterpieces appear in Blu-ray Disc April 6 as The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy.  The nine-disc set is bund to reawaken the powerful connection that fans have to these films through rich, robust colors and crisp sound that home audiences can only experience on Blu-ray Disc. The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy includes digital copies of each film on three separate discs and will also be BD-Live enabled, offering exciting new interactive possibilities.  The highly anticipated release precedes Warner Interactive Entertainment’s The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest videogame launch. The Lord of the Rings, the highest grossing adventure film franchise ever, began with the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, followed by The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The Trilogy’s Blu-ray release captures the enduring Fellowship and ultimate sacrifice while enhancing the chaos and destruction of Middle-earth, delivering a visual feast that will not soon, if ever, find its equal.  Of the 30 total Oscar Award nominations the three The Lord of the Rings movies received, they won a record 17 Oscar Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and 8 others for the third film. Based on the best-selling novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, Jackson’s movie trilogy is an epic journey of men, hobbits, elves, dwarves and the rest of Middle-earth’s creatures and cultures.  The films chronicle the struggle of good versus evil with fantastic special effects and a strong emotional center. The Trilogy debuts at a time when consumers are rapidly adopting Blu-ray Disc.  According to third quarter figures compiled by the Digital Entertainment Group (DEG), in 2009 Blu-ray Disc set-top player sales grew 112 percent over the same period last year and this holiday season consumers can expect to see Blu-ray player prices starting around $100, making it that much easier for home audiences to see the films they love the way they were meant to be seen.  Blu-ray devices are projected to be in 15 million U.S. homes by the end of this year. The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy will also be available day and date on Video on Demand from cable and satellite providers.  The films will be offered for electronic download from online retailers including iTunes, Microsoft Xbox LIVE, Zune marketplace and Amazon Video on Demand. Additionally, Warner Consumer Products has teamed up with top licensees Games Workshop Ltd., Tonner Doll Company, Inc., Sideshow Collectibles, The Noble Collection, WETA, Pez Candy, Funko, LLC, Bioworld Merchandising Inc. and WMS Gaming to create an array of merchandise supporting The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, including apparel and accessories, novelties and collectibles, stationery and paper goods, toys and games. The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest, slated for launch in spring 2010, will allow players to become the legendary Aragorn and embark on his greatest adventures through The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  For the first time ever, The Lord of the Rings comes to Wii™, delivering action-packed motion controlled game play that takes full advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchu. The game features accessible and authentic The Lord of the Rings game play designed for fans of all ages to enjoy together.  The game will also debut for PlayStation2 computer entertainment system, Nintendo DS™ and the PSP (PlayStation Portable) system.   Beyond The Lord of the Rings: Aragon’s Quest, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (WBIE) will publish multiple games across many genres designed to appeal to a wide range of unique gamers, including hard-core RPG fans as well as families.  Consumers who purchase The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest will find a coupon inside for $10 off The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy.  Similarly, consumers who purchase the Trilogy will find a coupon inside for $5 off The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy tells the story of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a hobbit who battles against the Dark Lord Sauron to save his world, Middle-earth, from the grip of evil. In the films, Frodo and his fellowship of friends and allies embark on a desperate journey to rid Middle-earth of the source of Sauron’s greatest strength, the One Ring — a ring that has the power to enslave the inhabitants of Middle-earth. Beside Wood, the films star Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, featuring Sean Bean, and Ian Holm, with Andy Serkis as Gollum. The films also star Marton Csokas, Craig Parker and Lawrence Makaoare."
"May 7, 2011",positive,"An army of filmmakers led by the director, Peter Jackson, has made the trilogy's central section a ringing testament to the power of motion pictures."
"Sep 19, 2010",positive," Like Hobbit protagonist Frodo Baggins wearing the hefty One Ring around his neck on a quest to destroy it, Peter Jackson no doubt struggled with the weight of fanboy expectations. Yet, over the course of three films in 2001, 2002 and 2003 and 10-plus hours — longer on the richer, fuller DVD director’s cuts — Jackson delivered soaring, searing tales of wonderment with electric, genre fence-jumping moves that rank these films among the all-time greats. An unflagging charge from the introductory first frame to the welcome-home last, The Lord of the Rings is powered by burnished, literary masterstrokes of heroism, courage, friendship, betrayal, love, resolve and anger. Where Jackson could have fallen from a precipice, he instead presented a cumulatively career-defining work of greatness. The worlds of men, dwarves, elves and Hobbits (furry short folk) are threatened by the reemergence of the One Ring — sought by the evil lord Sauron who would use it to overrun the land with creatures from the bowels of the world. In The Fellowship of the Ring, a small group is entrusted to journey across Middle-Earth and destroy the ring by tossing it into the fires of Mount Doom — easier said than done. Fellowship bears well the burden of exposition and character introduction, and also introduces two of the series’ numerous action setpieces, both set in the dank Mines of Moria. Battles against a cave troll and the viciously inflammatory Balrog aren’t just visual-effects reels, but trials by fire of the camaraderie among this band of brothers. The Two Towers — tracking the group as it has been severed and scattered — balances a rainy, prolonged battle for Helm’s Deep (a crucial outpost) with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and friend Samwise’s (Sean Astin) struggle for possession of the One Ring with the duplicitous Gollum. Driven to madness by the ring’s powers, what was once known as Smeagol transformed into the amphibious, murderous Gollum. Andy Serkis’s work in creating Gollum — he acted alongside Wood and Astin, with movements fed into a computer to animate the character — deserved an honorary Academy Award. His gestures and voice, not computer software, made Gollum so memorable as he wrestled with his inner homicidal maniac. Avoiding the ineffective conclusion jinx, The Return of the King set so many standards in its overwhelming epic wash that future attempts only seemed like pretenders to the throne. Even Avatar, as visionary as it could be, owed a debt to Jackson’s scope here. Every location, whether real or digitally enhanced, is a jaw-dropping dazzler. Minas Tirith resembles a fort as drawn by M.C. Escher, and its evil counterpart, Minas Morgul, looks like a demented Sydney Opera House lit by Kryptonite. It also allows supporting performers room for affecting arcs — Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan’s Pippin and Merry grow from curious troublemakers to noble warriors who understand the consequences of their choices. Plus, Astin delivers a performance of gale-force emotions, watching his lifelong friend teeter on the edge of madness and death. Its centerpiece — the rousing defense of Minas Tirith — is all it was billed to be, the battle to end all battles. Jackson takes us to the battlefield’s blades of grass with meticulous detail amid all the chaos. You feel the swath cut by charging, woolly mammoth-type beasts and the swift dive-bomb attacks of Sauron’s flying minions. King’s patient conclusion became a pop-culture punchline, but it certainly earns this extended epilogue. After hours spent with so many richly drawn characters — not just Frodo, Samwise, Pippin, Merry and Gollum, but Ian McKellen’s compassionate wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen’s swashbuckling rogue Aragorn and John Rhys-Davies’ Gimli, a fearless dwarf who learns tolerance in wartime — why wouldn’t Jackson strive to give each one a fitting, emotional sendoff? Although New Line, the trilogy’s financing studio, wound up folding after wasting its Rings profit on a passel of expensive projects, Jackson plans to return to Middle-Earth this decade. He’s producing (and now possibly directing) a two-part prequel with The Hobbit, to be released annually a la Rings."

"Mar 5, 2008",positive,More graphic in its violence and more fantastic in its imaginings than the first film.
"Dec 7, 2007",positive," Less direct and coherent than its predecessor, but wider in scope, Jackson/Tolkein's difficult second movie just about manages to get away with it all, and there are times when it provides a rollicking good adventure. I would recommend that the parents of young children go to see it themselves before escorting their offspring, as it is extremely violent and gruesome in places, echoing the director's earlier work, and there are moments which are genuinely scary (a rare thing in fantasy cinema). The darker story is somehow more satisfying, however, as we're now dealing with characters who begin to understand what they're about, instead of being frustratingly, albeit charmingly, delusional; so we can tackle the issues of war and conquest head on. Here are the battles only hinted at in the first film. Here is action where before there was only angst. Here is Peter Jackson in his element, vigorous and inventive, grabbing one's attention and holding onto it through long, complex scenes of conflict. There are brilliantly visualised war machines, intriguing tactical manouvers, blood and gore, Flynn-style fighting from the ballet-trained Orlando Bloom (as Legolas), and properly disgusting, bloodthirsty uruk-hai. Despite all this, much of the tweeness of the first story still lingers, most notably in the tale of Merry and Pippin, whose forest adventures do drag, slowing everything down, though this may satisfy those who insist that the greatest virtue such a movie might have is faithfulness to its source. Clever photography provides cinematic references to the work of HG Wells, both in the recurring comparison of the uruk-hai to morlocks (who are not treated altogether without sympathy), and in the demonstration of evil industry destroyed by natural forces. This latter part is a bit heavy-handed, a legacy of a cruder political age, when the First World War on which so much of Tolkein's fable is based helped to give birth to the New Age movement, but Jackson deftly steers away from the absolute condemnation of technological progress which has become a staple of modern fantasy. The real frustration at this point is simply that Christopher Lee (as Saurman) really doesn't get enough to do. The stand-out performances in this film come (once again) from Elijah Wood as the increasingly troubled Frodo, and from the computer-animated Gollum, whose pathetic split-personality soliloquies manage to be at once ridiculous, pitiful, and sinister. The interplay of these two characters presents an unusually astute study of the mechanics of addiction, and has the sort of real-world relevance which all really good fantasy strives to accomplish. Although Frodo and Gollum (and Sam, travelling with them) don't actually do very much, they remain fascinating to watch. Perhaps the greatest weakness of this story is that, aside from those final battles, nobody really does very much, at least not in comparison to the amount of soul-searching, strategic meandering and general arsing about. It's hard to care about a king as useless as Theoden, despite effective borrowings from Lear. Wormtongue comes across as altogether too crude and obvious to be disturbing. Eowyn's fight to be allowed to fight as she is able is affecting, but sidelined; and Aragorn's angst about his love for Arwen (with Liv Tyler still more wooden than the ents) gets tediously drippy, despite some beautiful gothic photography. The New Zealand landscape is still stunning, but less exciting this time. Sauron somehow doesn't seem as mighty as he should. If I go to see this film a second time, I shall take a (different) book, because there are passages within it which really are dull; but there are also parts which I rather think I might enjoy watching hundreds of times. The bittiness of the whole can be forgiven on account of their brilliance. The wargs are well realised and really scary, it's exciting to see Gandalf reveal how capable he really is, and the growing rapport between Gimli and Legolas makes it easier to care about these disparate characters. The set piece involving the flood is one of the most impressive uses of special effects I've ever seen, a really hard thing to get right, and it sweeps one away. The nazghul remain intensely creepy. Frodo's fall is heartbreaking. And, of course, Gollum gets the last word. This film is not altogether satisfying, but you'd be an idiot to miss it."
"Aug 13, 2007",positive," Even though I was lost through some of it, I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers better than its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring. As the middle section of what is really one long story (or one long nine-hour movie), it doesn’t bother setting anything up — it assumes you’ve seen the first one — and just plunges in. Whereas Fellowship gave us the sunlit complacency of the Shire darkening into grim duty, Two Towers begins on a note of near-disaster — a dream of the standoff between the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the fearsome Balrog — and mostly keeps its jaws clenched in readiness for hopeless battle. The theme of this Act Two is good warriors standing tall in the face of odds that could hardly suck worse. If that sounds like a downer, it isn’t; Peter Jackson, delivering the second of his three Christmas gifts to J.R.R. Tolkien fans worldwide, comes most alive during the scenes of peril and evil, of which there are enough here for a year’s worth of movies. One could conceivably enjoy The Two Towers knowing very little of its conflicts or interspecies politics; it can be processed as pure cinema, and forget about the plotlines, which in any event are unavoidably way stations to The Return of the King. We do spend a great deal of the movie watching characters prepare for things that won’t happen in the movie; even the big-bang sequence, the battle at Helm’s Deep, is but a minor skirmish in the grand scheme of things. A good deal of the dawdling is fun. The fearful comic-relief hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) find themselves hanging on a massive walking and talking tree — an Ent, really, a sort of plant elemental that watches over the green. These Ents talk slowly and arrive at decisions even more slowly; Jackson seems to be tweaking the ponderousness of most epics. Meanwhile, the human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) tries to get the woefully unprepared kingdom of Rohan ready for legions of merciless Uruk-hai sent by the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee); and Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), bearer of Tolkien’s mystical McGuffin the One Ring, and his loyal friend Samwise (Sean Astin) slouch towards Mordor to dispose of the thing, accompanied by the wretched Gollum. Most of the hype surrounding Two Towers has centered on Helm’s Deep and Gollum. Of the two — and the battle is one of the best of its kind in film history, a symphony of bloodlust and hopes dashed and restored — I prefer the little creature who used to be called Smeagol before the Ring stole his mind and soul. As you’ve heard, Gollum is played in voice and gesture by Andy Serkis, and fleshed out digitally by Jackson’s computer wizards. You’ll always be aware that Gollum isn’t literally “real,” but in his pathetically addled way he’s more real than anyone else in the movie. Jackson seems to have studied Jar Jar Binks and learned from George Lucas’s mistake. Two Towers may play narratively as a downer, but Jackson is too spirited a director to get bogged down: Characters are always reminding each other to keep hope alive in the midst of dread and panic. Hope is there, too, in the raw beauty Jackson finds everywhere, whether in battle or in a poetically downbeat episode at Rivendell with a weeping Arwen (Liv Tyler). Jackson hasn’t disdained his horror-movie roots, either: no director could be happier among the Orcs and Uruk-hai, and he has the diabolical wit to end this second entry on a note of demented enthusiasm that functions as a chilling cliffhanger. Fellowship interested and entertained me; this one hooked me."
"Jul 14, 2007",positive,"Yes, Peter Jackson demands nine hours of your time. But I can't think of a director more deserving."
"Feb 9, 2006",positive,"In size and scale, Jackson has redefined the word 'epic' -- but his attention to the small things really gives this series its awesome stature."
"Sep 30, 2005",positive," 
	And the Masterpiece continues.  With The Two Towers, director Peter Jackson takes us one step further along the journey of the quest to destroy the one ring of power.  As in The Fellowship of the Ring, the world of Middle Earth is faithfully re-created and we are re-immersed in the world that J.R.R. Tolkien created in his literary classic. 
	Jumping immediately into the action from where we left off in the first installment, The Two Towers hits the ground running and the action just never stops.  Having already established the situation and introduced the characters in The Fellowship of the Ring allows the plot to move along at a nice clip. 
	More than the first movie, The Two Towers differs from the book it is based upon.  The most important difference being that the movie ends one chapter short of the last chapter of the book.  This was the most shocking change because the book ends on a cliffhanger, where the movie, ending where it does, really isn't one.  Instead, it ends more at a moment where all of the characters are taking a breather, a pause in the action so to speak. 
	Another change, and this one is a good one, is that where as the book is clearly divided into two books, one covering Sam, Frodo, and Gollum, and the other covering the adventures of the rest of the Fellowship, with no cutting back and forth between the two, in the movie; the action is constantly cutting back and forth between the two.  This definitely helps the tension and the sense that all this is happening at the same time. 
	The best new part of this movie is the character of Gollum, who was only in the first one for a few moments.  If they were to give an Oscar for the best CGI character, he would win it hands down.  His schizophrenic conversations with himself are funny and touching at the same time.  He is the first computer animated character in a movie I actually felt was fully rounded and actually evoked emotions in me. 
	Another stunning moment in a movie filled with stunning moments, is the battle of Helms Deep.  It is to Fantasy battles what Saving Private Ryan's opening scene was to war movies.  The attack of the Orcs, who swarm like ants against the castle defended by our heroes is non-stop action and visually brilliant. 
	Frankly, this is one of those movies where a review is completely unnecessary.  If you saw The Fellowship of the Ring and enjoyed it (and how could you not?), then you'll enjoy this movie.  To put that another way, if you have any taste at all, then you'll enjoy this movie.  To put it one more way, these three movies will stand the test of time, they are already classics.  There is no reason for you not to see this movie.  It has action, adventure, romance, great characters, great villains, fabulous sets, special effects, and anything else you could possible want!  Go see this movie!!!! 
	As Scott said the second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy continues the magic of the first. The story grows more epic in scale and the cast of characters continues to increase. The kingdoms of Gondor and Rohan are introduced, as are the ents, led by the wistful Treebeard. Like in the first movie director Peter Jackson balances beautifully between faithfulness to the written word and small concessions to the celluloid reality of movie making. 
	Through the wonderful performance by Elijah Wood, we see the ring's effect on Frodo growing stronger. It is an addiction that has consumed Gollum and now threatens the brave hobbit. This arouses in Frodo sympathy for the tortured soul once called Smeagol. They are like two junkies in rehab; the One Ring of Power gives them a common bond that must be experienced to be understood. 
	My favorite characters in the books were always Gimli and Legolas. I love their contest to see who can kill the most orcs during the battle of Helms Deep. 
	The brilliance of the story is in the minute details that are painted on such a vast and ambitious canvas. At times we are standing back seeing the whole landscape with tiny figures running across the horizon and then seconds later we are privy to an intimate moment between characters we know like old friends. 
	I can't wait to watch all three of them together. They really are one long movie just as the books are really one long novel. I think Tolkien would approve. 
	Scott wrote that the movie ""hits the ground running."" Not exactly. Yes, most of the main characters are here so we do not need them introduced. What Scott did not mention is that many new characters get introduced. So there are many dialogue scenes. This movie really has no more or no less action than the first. 
	This film does have one hell of a climactic battle. It is however, the last half hour of a three hour movie. This battle alone is worth the price of the ticket. Actually my ticket was free. I got it out of my dvd case of The Fellowship Of The Ring. Anyway, the battle is suspenseful and thrilling. 
	Aragorn, Legalos and Gimli are the real focal point of this movie. Where as in the first movie the humor came from Merry and Pippin, in this one it is from Gimli. When he can't see over the rampart or when he asks Aragorn not to tell the elf that he had to toss him. The relationship between these three characters is what made the movie for me. 
	The weak part of this movie is the same as what I felt for the book. The Two Towers seems like so much filler. How many times do Sam and Frodo stand on a hill and look at Mordor? Do they ever get any closer? At one point Gollum has them right at the gates of Mordor. A few scenes later they appear to be further away again. remember in the first movie when Gandalf first looks out over the country and sees the fires of Mordor. Why couldn't Gandalf just lend Frodo his horse. Apparently he can get around a hell of a lot faster than these 2 hobbits. 
	The only plot development this movie has with Frodo is that we see him slowly succumbing to the weight of the ring. One of the scariest things in the first movie is the Nazgul. They are back and they now ride on black dragons. However, they are completely underused and thus not at all threatening. Luckily we have the much more entertaining story of Strider, Gimli and Legalos to carry this movie."
"Jul 5, 2005",positive," In the second installment of Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the franchise exceeds the majestic heights achieved a year ago by the first film of the series. Maintaining the commitment to cinematic beauty, story and amazing special effects he established with
  ""The Fellowship of the
    Ring,"" Jackson once again gives stunning life to one of the finest stories ever written with ""The Two Towers."" 
The film is divided into three subplots: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) continue their hunt of the nasty Uru-kai tribes in their search to rescue Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) from the Orcs who kidnapped them in the closing moments of ""Fellowship""; Merry and Pippin meet a new friend in their quest to regroup with their comrades; and Sam (Sean Astin) stands by Frodo's (Elijah Wood) side in their burdensome journey to Mordor, where they meet the treacherous yet helpful Gollum along the way. All of this happens in the midst of a brewing battle between Men and Orcs at the Rohan stronghold, Helm's Deep, by far one of the most engaging and exciting battle sequences ever filmed.  
While comparing the two movies is unfair because they each were produced with different goals in mind, ""Two Towers"" soars above ""Fellowship"" as the better film, probably due to the grander scale upon which it was made. The CGI character Gollum looks quite stunning as well, at times resembling a human actor so closely that you'll forget he's a computer creation.  
Peter Jackson upholds his credentials as a director, staying true to Tolkien's original work full of great battles, complicated love stories and the strengthening ties of friendship, while still incorporating the uniqueness he brings as a member of ""The Lord of the Rings"" team. This second film is just as long as the first, though, and it doesn't quite finish the second book, which leaves a lot of leftover work for the third and final film of this series. In other words, the wait for ""The Return of the King"" will drag on even more painfully than the past year did. 
DVD Review: 
For anyone who thought that the four-disc extended editions  of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy was the be-all and end-all of DVD releases,  you’re sadly mistaken. The limited edition releases of the film deliver the definitive “LOTR” experience. Sure, they  don’t have two extra discs worth of bonus material, but who needs to sort  through all of that junk when the included documentary features everything you  could ever want? Produced by critically acclaimed documentary filmmaker Costa  Boates, the three never-before-seen documentaries total just over five hours  and includes coverage on everything from production, post-production, and even  a few on-set antics with the cast/crew. Also featured on the two-disc set for  the first time ever are both the theatrical and extended versions of the film  (via seamless branching), which makes this a no-brainer purchase for those who  currently own the original theatrical releases on DVD.

"Mar 3, 2005",negative,"I began to wonder, as the waves crashed about: Is it still possible for a movie to get excited about people?"
"Jan 15, 2005",positive," Busing to work one morning last January, I counted four commuters with their noses buried in copies of a book first published in 1954. J. R. R. Tolkien's perpetually popular epic The Lord of the Rings is more beloved than ever, thanks to director Peter Jackson's shock-inducing 2001 film The Fellowship of the Ring. Exhilarated by Fellowship's cliffhanger ending, newcomers and old fans alike rushed to the books for resolution. As they line up for The Two Towers, some people may have an inkling that there is more to this mayhem than meets the eye. Tolkien the Mythmaker knew that stories rooted in truth will endure. In Middle Earth, a world stripped down to essentials — earth, fire, water, wood, metal, flesh, spirit — we see our own dying world mirrored and clarified. Further, we see reflections of God's grace, Christ's sacrifice, and the hope of resurrection. Such elemental plotting speaks to our longings, evoking both sorrow and joy. Towers opens with a cliffhanger (literally), and when a hero falls, an adrenaline rush begins that never lets up. ""It's getting heavier,"" Frodo says of the ring. As the temperature rises, fires of spiritual conflict that ignited in Fellowship eventually explode into war. Hobbits Merry and Pippin, abducted by orcs, are pursued by three companions: Gimli the untossable dwarf, Legolas the elf, and Aragorn, reluctant heir to the kingdom of men. But these would-be rescuers are soon diverted to a different task: King Theoden needs help in saving his people before Saruman's orcs lay waste to his kingdom. Their victory depends upon Frodo the ring-bearer who, with Samwise at his side, wearily trudges across blasted Mordor miles. The ring draws villains from all directions. Gollum creeps up behind, winged devils patrol the skies, and Sauron's watchful Eye never blinks. Dire straits indeed. If this were a video game, you'd just hit Start Over. Filling Out Gollum
But for all its digital wizardry, this is no game. Towers falls just short of Fellowship as the finest film of its genre. The scenery alone justifies the high price of your ticket. Designers Alan Lee and John Howe continue to dazzle us with convincing creatures, castles, and environments. Battle scenes unsurpassed in scale and intensity inspire awe. The performances—most notably those of Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen — are as intense as in the first film. Actor Andy Serkis collaborates with animators, bringing vivid life to the vicious, hissing Gollum. The film occasionally stumbles. Towers clearly posed a formidable challenge to its screenwriters. Fellowship followed a motley crew through trial and tribulation; Towers tracks three sets of characters—four, if you count Saruman's behind-the-scenes meddling. Some stories gallop, others only amble. Thus, Towers feels rushed and fragmented, channel-surfing from plot to plot. Jackson complicates matters. In Fellowship, he wisely pruned branches of plot to emphasize the ring-bearer's quest, shoehorning enough story for a six-hour film into three. This time he replaces important episodes with unnecessary tangents. We lose our intimacy with major characters: Gandalf is too busy to chat, Merry and Pippin get stranded too long on Treebeard's shoulders, and Gimli is reduced to punchlines (fortunately, he's hilarious). Treebeard's folk seem lazy and naïve, a far cry from Tolkien's magisterial Ents. New villains fail to frighten as the Cave Troll, Balrog, and Black Riders did in Fellowship. (Still, concerned parents should be wary: Towers is more violent and monster-filled than Fellowship.) And purists will grumblingly inquire why Jackson stopped short of such climactic scenes as Gandalf's visit to Isengard and Frodo in Shelob's Lair. Enough quibbling. These flaws fail to blunt the impact of the story's resonant moral insights. Tolkien made every character's heart a battlefield between desire and selflessness, and Jackson underlines and boldfaces this theme. Call it Soul Wars, Episode Two. Villains give in to greed; heroes persevere through Christlike suffering. Gandalf returns from death's edge, a risen savior. His healing of the poisoned King Theoden, which Jackson gleefully exaggerates, stands as one of the great movie exorcisms. Arwen surrenders her immortality in the name of love. Aragorn wrestles personal demons, preparing to be a messianic king. Samwise, patient and forgiving, helps Frodo carry his cross. The fiercest struggle takes place in the tortured soul of Gollum. Smeagol — Gollum's original, hobbit-like self — struggles feebly to overcome his ravenous, lustful alter ego like a timid child trying to slay a dragon. It is the filmmakers' most commendable triumph that he gains our sympathies. We come to hope that, by Frodo's stripes, this poor creature can be healed. In a season when critical favorites (Adaptation, 8 Mile, Gangs of New York) tell fractured tales of heroes with broken moral compasses, it is encouraging to watch Tolkien's triumphs, tragedies, and consolations coalesce in the most compelling adventure film of 2002. If Jackson shows the same focus in The Return of the King (to be released in 2003), it could be the most meaningful of them all. Our sister publication Books & Culture asked in its January/February 2002 issue if Tolkien should be acknowledged as the foremost author of the twentieth century."

"Jun 19, 2003",positive," Is it too early to say
The Lord of the Rings is the best cinematic fantasy trilogy of all time,
even with the series’ third installment The Return of the King still a
year a way? Based on this second chapter, The Two Towers, it most
certainly is not. I cannot imagine, with all three films shot at once, that the
climax to this story will be any less of a stunning success than both this film
and The Fellowship of the Ring proved to be. Part two literally
hits the ground running. There is no exposition, no quick recap of last year’s
Oscar-winning epic, and this sequel is all the better because of this. Even so The
Two Towers is fabulously entertaining, if only for its massive scope and suitably
epic vision alone. This gigantic undertaking is never anything less than
stunning for practically every second of its almost three-hour running time, surpassing
the considerably large expectations of an over-eager audience at nearly every opportunity. The fellowship has
been fractured beyond repair. The ringbearer Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood)
and his loyal friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are making their way into
the treacherous lands of Mordor alone, Meanwhile, their hobbit companions Merry
(Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are being held captive
by a murderous band of Uruk-hai making their way to the traitorous wizard
Saruman (Christopher Lee). But they will not be left to die. Human
Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and dwarf
Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are fast on the horde’s trail, and no matter
what it takes they will save their two hobbit friends. This chase comes to a
sudden end with the arrival of an old friend. Thought dead in the caverns of
Moria fighting the vicious Balrog, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is
brought back to join the fight. Joining the three warriors, he lets them know
Merry and Pippin have been safely let out of danger and into the arms of the ancient
tree creatures known as the Ents, instructing Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli to stop
worrying about the two hobbits and that they must change direction and make for
the kingdom of Rohan immediately. As for Frodo and Sam,
enter into a dangerous alliance with the devilish Gollum (Andy Serkis).
Hoping to find some shred of his former self still intact, the ringbearer
spares the wicked creature’s life in return for leading them into the heart of
Mordor. At first Frodo’s trust seems to pay dividends as the ravaged soul of
the beast, brutalized to virtual erasure under the influence of the One Ring
for so many decades, begins to awake from its exceedingly long slumber, the
former hobbit making a valiant attempt to beat down the psychotic influences of
Gollum and let his former self known as Sméagol regain control. But the influence
of the One Ring is not so easily overcome, and Sam isn’t so certain their new
guide isn’t just biding his time as he plots both his and Frodo’s demise. That is a lot of balls
in the air to try and juggle successfully, and with handfuls of new characters
added to the mix director Peter Jackson and his team of craftsman unsurprisingly
have their work cut out for them. Yet it is all handled splendidly. Introduction
of the new characters is handled quickly and with eloquence. What more, even
with the sequel’s breakneck pace each person is given room to develop into a fully-formed
multidimensional human being. The best of these new
human faces are Éowyn (Miranda Otto) and Théoden, King of Rohan (Bernard
Hill). Otto is magnificent, her gorgeous face glistening with determination
and purpose even in the face of the gravest danger. But she’s no girly-girl,
and her growing infatuation with future king Aragorn is quietly subtle. Hill is
even better. As for Théoden, he’s broken shell of a man first introduced, poisoned
by the venom-filled words of his adviser Gríma Wormtongue (a slithery Brad
Dourif). But with all his character loves and holds dear under threat of
annihilation, Hill blossoms from lost soul to worried king to forceful leader
throughout his story arc, adding a level of haunted gravitas to the story that’s
superb. The seductive
influence of greed, power and pure evil are ever-present, most notably in the
film’s most ingenious creation Gollum. Here is the first completely CGI
character that isn’t just a technical showpiece, and credit for that must fall
as much on actor Serkis’ shoulders as it should the production’s technical
crew. It is a delicious performance overflowing in internalized conflict and irrational
obsession, all of it raging inside the body of a pitiful lost soul. While I can’t
say these visual effects are seamless, Gollum is far from photorealistic, that
does not make them any less impressive. This is a groundbreaking performance
that will change the cinematic game forever, the creature’s movements and
mannerisms birthed from the mind of the actor creating them and then dazzlingly
augmented by Jackson’s crackerjack effects team. At its center, The
Two Towers delivers one of the most spectacular battle sequences I have
personally ever seen. The Battle of Helm’s Deep is like Henry V at Agincourt
but with the odds multiplied by at least a factor of ten. Jackson unleashes a flurry
of flying arrows, swinging swords and huge explosions. Taking up a full hour of
screen time, this is a titanic struggle between good and evil where the outcome
always feels, even for those who have read Tolkien’s book, somewhat in doubt.
It’s breathlessly incredible stuff, the final showdown an eye-popping, emotion-fueled
triumph that had me wanting to rise to my feet and cheer. Yet as magnificent as all of that might be Jackson never loses sight of the bigger picture. The director astutely hints at what is still to come, knowing full well that the major dramatic twist and turns will culminate in force during the trilogy’s final chapter. But he still allows for this film to stand entirely on its own even though it is the middle chapter of the story. This is a landmark epic and a glorious entry into what is quickly becoming the most entertaining movie trilogy since the original Star Wars series. I was left perfectly contented by the time things came to their expected cliffhanger of a conclusion, and I’m beyond positive The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a motion picture I’ll happily watch multiple times in the future.

"Mar 7, 2003",positive," You'd better get reading - unless you're up to speed on the story so far, part two of Tolkien's trilogy could be a baffling experience. You can see why the title of The Two Towers, Peter Jackson's new Tolkien film, has caused a certain disquiet in the US by coincidentally evoking associations with the World Trade Centre's Twin Towers. Nonetheless, I'm glad he stuck with it. As it happens, in this installment of the trilogy, allegorical echoes of September 11 and its aftermath can be heard all over Middle-earth.  I realise that such a reading would have outraged Tolkien, who rejected all attempts to draw parallels between his mythical world and our own. But the temptation is irresistible - especially right now. As we rejoin the Hobbits, their faith in the power of good has been shaken to its foundations. The great wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), is no more, and in the black fortress of Isengard, his evil counterpart, Saruman (Christopher Lee) is gathering an army of mass destruction. What's more, there's no way of getting weapons inspectors in. To be honest, I'm not one of Tolkien's fans. This doesn't mean I fail to respect their clout. It's the reason Jackson feels confident enough to plunge in here precisely where he left off at the end of part one. There is no wimpy recapping of earlier events. We're shown Frodo (Elijah Wood) reliving Gandalf's defeat in a dream sequence, and that's it for exposition.  If you're not already on board, you scrabble around as best you can, and this means hard work, which is something rare - and yes, exhilarating - in a modern blockbuster. While getting your bearings in Middle-earth, you have to keep pace with rapidly multiplying sub-plots and newly introduced species.  Along with the Orcs, the Elves, the Hobbits and the Khazad are the Ents, the Ringwraiths and the Uruk-Hai. And if you're already confused, preliminary research is advisable. Or not.  The alternative is just to concentrate on Gollum, a creature of such unnerving weirdness that he alone is enough to make this episode an infinitely more involving proposition than the last. Created by laying a computer-generated image over the movements of an actor (Andy Serkis) wearing a body-hugging speedskater's suit, Gollum is both ancient and child-like, hideous and pitiful.  When we catch up with him, he's nearly 600 years old - a naked, bat-eared, goblin-like figure bleached to a skeletal whiteness by the centuries of travail and torture, brought upon him by his obsession with the Ring and the power it bestows.  A minute spent in his bony, spectral presence is a far creepier experience than any number of poundings by Jackson's massed armies of the night.  Gollum is out to steal the Ring for himself - or the bad part of him is. His benign half knows it should help Frodo destroy it and so save the world. And as he does battle with himself over this eternal dilemma, you feel as if you could be eavesdropping on the White House hawks as they beat back the odd dove in their midst during debates about foreign policy. Ranging further through Middle-earth, and giving you a better sense of Tolkien's philosophies - pro-ecology and anti-technology to the point of making him a Luddite - this film is a better-paced effort than the first. It also introduces a bunch of new characters, among them an uncharacteristically stern-faced David Wenham as the ruler of the Human stronghold of Gondor, and Miranda Otto as a princess of Rohan, the kingdom under threat from Saruman's armies. Otto's role is the film's big disappointment. Advance word led to expectations of a fully functioning warrior princess. Instead, she's allowed only a couple of Ninja-like flourishes with her broadsword before being sent back to join the womenfolk. Which brings me to the main trouble with Tolkien and his cold-climate mythology, and it goes beyond the complaint that women are relegated to bit players. His gods and demi-gods are so drearily chaste. Not for him the blithe omnisexuality of the Hindu and Mediterranean gods, who regard power and eroticism as interchangeable. He's not even into Arthurian notions of licensed flirtation. His preferred method of romance is by remote control - a case of abstinence making the heart grow fonder.  You sense him nodding approvingly when Hugo Weaving's Elf king is moved to lecture his daughter Arwen (Liv Tyler) on the miseries to come if she insists on pursuing her cross-species love affair with the mortal hero, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). He'll grow old and die and she'll be forced to watch before wandering off to spend the rest of her days in weary solitude. What still excites me most about the films are the behind-the-scenes adventures which went into their making. Jackson pledged his down under armies of craftsmen, technicians and special effects people to his cause, took it to the gates of Hollywood and returned with the money to make these things. Even more to his credit, the adventure continues."

The first thing I should say when reviewing Lord Of The Rings:
The Two Towers, Peter Jackson’s three-hour follow-up
to his immensely powerful first installment of the Lord Of
The Rings fantasy saga, last December’s The
Fellowship Of The Ring, is that in doing so I must reveal
certain story aspects that could be considered spoilers. The legions
of die-hard fans of J.R.R. Tolkein’s books know what happens
in the story, but those who haven’t read the books may want
to avoid reading this review until after they’ve seen the
film, as there is at least one major surprise inherent in the
plot. Having said that, the second point that pops to mind is
that it would be an enormous task for Jackson to outdo last year’s
phenomenon, since it was one of the most amazing all-around cinematic
experiences to come along in years, and this is merely the second
of three installments. And yet he pretty much does just that.
This second episode (filmed simultaneously with the first and
third) lives up in every way to the epic grandeur of last year’s
movie, layering Tolkein’s famous story, adapted by Fran Walsh,
Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair, and director Jackson, with
the same sweeping cinematography, enchantingly realized effects,
and flawless acting as Fellowship, while adding the many
new characters, creatures, and locations included in the second
book. There are a few choices that I was not particularly thrilled
with, but I’ll get to that in a minute.
 In terms of story, this is obviously a continuation of the
quest begun by hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) to destroy the
immensely powerful One Ring created by the evil sorcerer Sauron,
by traveling back to Sauron’s domain of Mordor and casting
it into the fires of Mt. Doom from whence it came. But it’s
hard to do that when everybody you encounter, good and bad, wants
it for their very own. While Frodo’s hobbit friend Sam Gamgee
(Sean Astin) stuck with him at the end of the first movie, the
remaining members of the fellowship were scattered. Gandalf The
Grey (Ian McKellen), the wise and friendly wizard, fell into the
depths of Moria while battling the immense fire-beast Balrog,
but as we learn in an amazing action sequence at the very beginning
of Towers, he was not killed, but, having battled the monster
to the death, was transformed into Gandalf The White, with much
more power to do good. Meanwhile, the two other hobbits, Merry
(Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), were captured by the
army of orcs under the control of evil wizard Saruman (Christopher
Lee), and the other 3 remaining members, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen)
and his friends Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the
dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), began pursuing the orcs through the
land of Rohan to save their friends.
 This has got to be the first movie where one of the most remarkable
performances was done by a computer-generated character. The strange
and immensely creepy creature Gollum, a.k.a. Sméagol, who
was hardly seen in Fellowship, becomes one of the main
characters here, crawling along with Frodo and Sam, first attempting
to kill them for the ring, but then becoming their guide through
the treacherous land of Mordor. Don’t get me wrong—this
is not a slam against the live actors, who all do exquisite work;
it’s a compliment to the technical staff who can create a
complex, conflicted character seemingly out of thin air, and of
the powerful work by Andy Serkis, who not only voiced Sméagol
but participated in his scenes wearing a motion-capture suit which
allowed the computer technicians who created the creature to follow
his every move. Gollum is so tortured, so conflicted; he’s
capable of so many subtle facial and vocal expressions, that as
he wrestles with his schizophrenic characterization we don’t
know whether to revile or pity him. This is an immensely important
point, since one of the major plot elements is Frodo’s struggle
with the same decision.
 New characters and new cinematic challenges are presented in
this story, all realized with the same creative genius Jackson
showed us last year. The epic battle of Helm’s Deep, only
possible after Gandalf frees King Théoden of Rohan (Bernard
Hill) from the evil influence of Saruman’s minion Wormtongue
(Brad Dourif), is as visually remarkable in some ways as Speilberg’s
battle footage in Saving Private
Ryan. Théoden’s nephew Éomer (Karl
Urban) and niece Éowyn (Miranda Otto) are both introduced
as powerful allies to the fellowship, as well as Faramir (David
Wenham), the brother of Boromir, who was killed at the end of
the first film. The ents, a tree-like race of forest shepherds
led by Treebeard (another CGI creation with the voice of Rhys-Davies),
are as remarkable from a sound standpoint as they are visually,
with their deep voices uttering out the slow, droning intonations
of their ancient language. “It takes us a long time to say
things,” rumbles Treebeard, “but we only say things
that are worth saying.” Then there are the titular towers
themselves, Saruman’s Orthanc, standing starkly amid the
scorched earth of his orc factory at Isengard, and Barad-Dur,
located in the center of Mordor, where Sauron’s huge, disembodied
eye maintains a constant vigil for the Ring. Finally there are
brief but important repeat performances by Liv Tyler as Arwen,
the elf-princess in love with Aragorn, Hugo Weaving as her father
Elrond, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, the all-knowing elvish
priestess.
 The only things I can find wrong with this movie (and they
are minor points) are some slight alterations of the plot, which
will annoy the devoted Middle-Earth freaks more than they did
me, like Aragorn’s brief disappearance in the middle of the
film. That it never occurs in the original text is less annoying
than the fact that it feels like a cheap repetition of what happened
to Gandalf in the first film. I also don’t like that Gimli
becomes an almost comic character, constantly pratfalling and
enduring Jackson’s cinematic short jokes, one of which is
truly ridiculous. His character in the books is just as noble
and respected as all the others; here he almost becomes a stooge.

"Jan 14, 2003",positive," Gird your loins, buckle your armor, take a deep breath and plunge yourself into the dark, fierce epic that is part two of ""The Lord of the Rings."" That Peter Jackson and his remarkable team have done it again is no surprise. Most of it was shot at the same time as the first, so it wasn't apt to fall apart. Still, what's remarkable is how immediately, after a full year, ""The Two Towers"" seizes your attention, and how urgently it holds you through three seamless, action-packed hours. The Fellowship had split apart when last we saw them, and the new film follows three separate trails. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), heading for Mordor to destroy the Ring, are joined in their quest by an emaciated, suspiciously servile creature named Gollum, who offers to serve as their guide. Elsewhere in Middle Earth, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) come to the aid of King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill), who must defend his kingdom against Saruman's terrifying army of Orcs and Uruk-hai. In the Forest of Fangorn, the two hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are rescued from their captors by an Ent named Treebeard, an ancient walking and talking tree, who must be persuaded to join arms with the humans, the hobbits and the Elves to defend Middle Earth from the evil Sauron. At stake is... everything. ""The Two Towers"" takes more liberties with Tolkien than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" did; it's also more violent and nightmarish. But Jackson, a master of scale and perspective, doesn't let it become claustrophobic. Few people can stage a battle--and the eyepopping siege of Helms Deep is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see--with such sweep and clarity that the carnage doesn't seem an oppressive end in itself. The tale never loses touch with its human core. Amid all the surreal visions, terrifying monsters and overwhelming landscapes, it's the naked, skinny, schizophrenic Gollum who snakes his way most deeply into your memory. Created digitally with a motion-capture technique that mimicked the movements of actor Andy Serkis (who also supplied his hissing voice), Gollum is a previously hobbitlike creature, grotesquely deformed by having once possessed the Ring. While everyone else in Tolkien's myth falls neatly into the camps of Good and Evil, the self-lacerating Gollum is at war with himself. In an epic drenched in medievalism, he's the dangerously ambiguous voice of the modern. Martin Scorsese's lavish, wildly ambitious epic of 1860s New York takes the audience down some of the meaner streets in American history. It's set in Five Points, a crime-ridden slum where recently arrived immigrants are pitted against brutally xenophobic nativists, and anarchy is held at bay (just barely) by the tribal dictates of competing gangs with names like the Plug Uglies, the Daybreak Boys and the Dead Rabbits. The scariest and most powerful of the local warlords is William Cutting, a.k.a. Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a one-eyed nativist who would just as soon carve up an Irishman as a slice of pork. ""Gangs of New York"" culminates in the violent Draft Riots of 1863, and as a dark, diligently researched history lesson, it fascinates and enlightens. The problem is with the drama in the foreground. This tale of revenge, in which young Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to the Five Points to kill the Butcher--the man who murdered his father--takes a mighty long time to engage your emotions. It doesn't fully catch fire until the ""Hamlet""-like midsection when Amsterdam, having been treated as a surrogate son by the unwitting Bill, first tries and fails to kill him. Bill's a vibrant villain, and a stunningly theatrical Day-Lewis plays him to the hilt. But our hero remains one-dimensional, and the usually spontaneous DiCaprio seems constrained by the part. It doesn't help that his romance with Cameron Diaz's pickpocket prostitute falls back on first-they-kiss-then-they-fight cliches. Scorsese seems most engaged in the violent set pieces, which have a brutal, terrifying poetry. But a cloak of artifice hangs over the movie. ""Gangs"" is a dream project Scorsese has wanted to make for 30 years. You have to honor its mad ambition. But sadly, it feels like a dream too long deferred. The teenage runaway Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a child prodigy of crime. By the time he was arrested at 21 he had cashed millions of dollars in forged checks and had successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a university teacher, with a combination of charm, charisma and chutzpah. His true story (cleverly adapted by Jeff Nathanson) is the basis for former child prodigy Steven Spielberg's zippy ""Catch Me If You Can,"" a delicious cat-and-mouse game flecked with intriguing Oedipal undertones. As the mercurial mouse, DiCaprio sparkles, far more comfortable in the ever-changing skin of this slick chameleon than he is in Scorsese's epic. The dogged cat is FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (a droll, buttoned-down Tom Hanks), always one methodical step behind his prey. As Hanratty's pursuit drags on from year to year, his resolve never wavers, but his enmity evolves into an almost paternal concern for his young foe. Meanwhile, Frank's real dad, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), looms behind his son's every larcenous deed. He's a charming, fast-talking failure whose slippery relationship with the truth and firm belief in the importance of appearances provide the template for his son's life of deception. Walken's performance is hilarious, poignant and full of surprises. It's nice to see Spielberg in a larky, relatively modest spirit. ""Catch Me"" is never less than engaging; all that's missing is a proper crescendo. The picture moves along briskly, even at two and a half hours, but it seems to be running on cruise control. Spielberg has caught the sunny, primary-color spirit of the prewar '60s, the American optimism that Frank Jr. both exemplifies and parodies. Frank lives life as if he were an actor in a movie, his costumes determining his identity, his fate dependent on improv, with all the mundane, boring parts (school, job training) edited out. Like Spielberg, he's a firm believer in cutting to the chase. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones put on quite a show in Rob Marshall's dazzling cinematic rethinking of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical directed by Bob Fosse. The setting is Prohibition-era Chicago, and our antiheroines are two bitter rivals, aspiring singer Roxie Hart (Zellweger) and vaudeville star Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), both jailed for killing their men. There's nothing like notoriety to jump-start a career, Roxie reasons; she hires legendary lawyer Billy Flynn (a tap-dancing Richard Gere) to plead her case, and parlays murder into celebrity. When I saw the 1995 Broadway revival, late in its run, the show's cynical bite needed dentures. Now director-choreographer Marshall, screenwriter Bill Condon and a cast that includes Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly (who knew he could sing and dance?) have restored its teeth. The musical numbers are now presented as figments of Roxie's spotlight-lusting imagination, and the movie flows back and forth--stylishly, fluidly--between reality and illusion. On the surface, Zellweger isn't the tough cookie we associate with the role (a gum-chewing Ginger Rogers played her in the 1942 ""Roxie Hart""), but her veneer of vulnerability makes her venom effective. (Who knew she could sing and dance?) ""Chicago"" is exuberantly theatrical yet every inch a movie, and some numbers (""The Cell Block Tango"") are so entertaining you might want to applaud. First ""Moulin Rouge,"" now this. Could the movie musical be making a comeback? Roman Polanski escaped from the Cracow ghetto when he was 7 years old. Until now, he has avoided making a film about the Holocaust, though you could feel its shadow behind every movie he has made. ""The Pianist,"" the first feature he's made in Poland since his 1962 ""Knife in the Water,"" isn't autobiographical. It's based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, an acclaimed concert pianist who miraculously survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. But you can feel it was made by a man who's been there. It's in the little details, in its refusal of sentimentality, in its cleareyed assessment of the depths people will descend to--Jews, Poles and Germans alike--as well as the heights to which they rise. The objective tone--a detachment that contains pools of rage and sorrow--is set by Szpilman himself, who never raises his voice in his memoirs. Nor does Adrien Brody, who plays him here with soulful elegance. At first, Szpilman is an urbane, slightly aloof onlooker of the approaching nightmare. Then, when he and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto, the man who has everything becomes a man who has nothing. Saved from deportation to the camps by a Jewish turncoat guard--the rest of his family are not so lucky--he eventually escapes from the ghetto, only to become a hunted man, alone, sickly, hiding for his life. English playwright Ronald Harwood's screenplay sticks close to Szpilman's book, showing us everything through the protagonist's eyes. The Warsaw ghetto uprising is seen only as it's glimpsed through the window of Szpilman's hideout just outside the ghetto walls. For long stretches of his confinement, he's more a witness than a participant in the drama: we see, through him, the spectacle of a great city reduced to physical and moral rubble. Polanski shows us shocking visions--Nazi soldiers hurling an invalid off a balcony, a starving man licking spilled soup off the dirty ghetto pavement--but he never hypes up the horror for effect. ""The Pianist"" is all the more harrowing, and moving, for this restraint. This powerful, precision-made movie offers hope as well--an act of kindness from a German officer that saves the pianist's life, the music that sustains his soul. In going home to tell Szpilman's story Polanski seems reborn: once again he's become a filmmaker who matters."

"Jan 9, 2003",positive," If you didn’t  see 2001’s The Fellowship of the Ring — the first chapter in Peter Jackson‘s three-part film version of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings — get the DVD. Jackson leaps into Part II with no patience for laggers. The Two Towers, shot at the same time as Part I and Part III, is spectacular in every sense of the word, even if you don’ t know an Orc from a Uruk-Hai. Here’s the tease: The fellowship has scattered. Frodo the Hobbit (Elijah Wood) still holds the all-powerful ring that he and Sam (Sean Astin) must drop into Mount Doom. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are adrift in a forest talking to an Ent, a tree that talks back. The human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen, growing steadily impressive in the role) is still fighting the evil Saruman (Christopher Lee) with the help of Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies). It’s Aragorn who must release the Rohan king (a noble, moving Bernard Hill) from Saruman’s spell and help save Middle-earth in a climactic clash at Helm’s Deep (the parallels to the warring forces of democracy and fundamentalism are inescapable) that ranks with the greatest battles in film history. The Two Towers suffers a bit from being the middle chapter (no beginning, no end), but Jackson keeps the action percolating. The effects astonish, none more so than Gollum, a computer-generated creature, hauntingly voiced by Andy Serkis. Gollum looks like a wasted junkie and speaks (with a rasp to rival Linda Blair’s in The Exorcist) of the ring that corrupted him as “my precious.” The battle between good and evil in this character catches the soul of the movie. The Return of the King, the final chapter, will be released a year from now. I can’t wait."

"Jan 3, 2003",positive," January 2, 2003 -- ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is best viewed not as a single film, but as one-third of an epic film. The first part of this epic was ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings,"" released a year ago, and the last third of this epic will be, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" to be released next Christmas. The three films can rightly be regarded as one for two reasons: One, they are based on three books which form both a trilogy and a single story; two, because all three films were shot at the same time over a three-year period by the same director, cast and crew. In a sense, this is a big-screen mini-series. 
It is no surprise then, that ""Two Towers"" picks up right were the last film in the series left off. There is no introduction of characters and little character development in this film because all that was done in the first film. The story is split into four parallel stories. The first is the continuing adventures of the two Hobbits, Frodo and Samwise, who are trying to destroy the One Ring, so that Sauron can't get his hands on it and use it to destroy the world. The second is the continuing adventures of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they make a last stand to stop the huge Uruk-hai army of Sauruman (an ally of Sauron) at the fortress of Helm's Deep. The third is the continuing adventures of the remainder of the Fellowship of the Ring, two Hobbits known as Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took and Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck. The film constantly shifts among these three main subplots, and one other subplot, which isn't in the book, a developing romantic triangle between Aragorn, Arwen Undómiel and Éowyn, princess of Rohan. 
There is so much cutting back and forth, that nothing much seems to happen in the film, until the battle at Helm's Deep, that is. The battle is spectacular in its scope and fury. Even though it uses a time-honored Western cliché, this is an epic screen battle. Despite that, this film, like the book, serves to continue to the story and, like a bridge, deliver us to that last film, which should be even more spectacular. Viewed as a separate entity, this film is not quite as successful as the first because the narrative is split four ways, and there is less character development. This film rates a B+ when viewed separately, but rates an A when viewed as a part of a magnificent whole. 
A couple of major new characters are developed in the film, and both are non-human. Gollum, introduced in the first film at a distance, becomes a full-fledged character in the ""Two Towers"" after being captured by Samwise and Frodo. Although his appearance on the screen is a computer construct, much of Gollum's considerable personality is due to the acting skills of Andy Serkis of ""24 Hour Party People."" Serkis doesn't just do the voice of Gollum, he also provides much of the motion for the character in the film. Serkis performed all the Gollum scenes in the movie wearing special motion-capture devices which enabled filmmakers to substitute Gollum's image for Serkis after filming. The other new character is Treebeard (voice by John Rhys-Davies), the Ent, a computer-generated construct created by WETA Digital of New Zealand, which did many of the computer-generated effects in the film. Another new character is Gríma Wormtongue, a really nasty advisor to King Théodon (Bernard Hill). The character of Wormtongue is brought to life perfectly by veteran character actor Brad Dourif of ""Alien: Resurrection."" Other new characters include Éowyn (Miranda Otto of ""What Lies Beneath""), Éomér, Rohan warrior and nephew to King Théodon (played by Karl Urban). 
Returning characters include Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), Pippin (Billy Boyd), Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom of ""Black Hawk Down""), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Sauruman (Christopher Lee). The acting is solid throughout. The other returning star of this film is the stunning mountain scenery of New Zealand, where this was filmed. Huge, impressive sets built in remote areas of New Zealand give us an authentic-looking castle of Rohan and the fortress of Helms Deep. Although there isn't much character development in the film (aside from Gollum), the relationships between Frodo and Samwise, and between Pippin and Merry are sketched in a bit more. Despite the fact that this film is nearly 3 hours long, it seems rushed because of the need to cut back and forth among the various story lines. Look for more of the story to be filled in and look for more character development in the next DVD in the series. The first ""special edition"" DVD for the last film provided additional footage that smoothed out the narrative flow of the first film. I anticipate the same for the ""Two Towers"" DVD, due out towards the end of this year. Again, kudos to director Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew for filming a story long thought to be unfilmable. It is an incredibly difficult project, but the filmmakers are not just succeeding in their task, they are making a truly exceptional film series in the process.

But that’s not a complete answer, since The Two Towers is, in many respects, a very different film than its predecessor in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s much more of a Grand Epic, so it’s somewhat less thoughtful than the first film by its very nature. As a result, it lacks a good bit of Fellowship’s emotional intensity. There is nothing in The Two Towers, for instance, that carries the same emotional resonance as the first film’s final scene of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) in the boat, nor is there anything to conclude this new entry that bears the same kind of punch as the The Two Towers’ closing shot. Those reservations aside, the second film is a remarkable achievement — and a groundbreaking one. The Two Towers follows Frodo and Sam’s further attempts to return the ring of power to the fires from whence it came, while the film separately details the adventures of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and also deals with the resurrection of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the fates of hobbits Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominc Monaghan). It’s a huge canvas — and there is more to it than even this list of principal characters indicates — but Peter Jackson details it all so lovingly and so carefully that the movie never confuses. Moreover, the timing of individual sequences — the nature of the narrative requiring much cross-cutting between characters — is beyond reproach. At no time do you ever get the sense that you’ve stayed away from one story line for too long; Jackson and his co-writers have scored a major triumph in this regard. And in so many others as well. There is simply no way a review can begin to discuss or even catalogue the immense riches of The Two Towers, so I’ll settle on discussing a few of its finer points. First of all, it’s a movie that is both very much of its time, and one that is steeped in the history of film. For example, scene after scene in the court of Theoden (Bernard Hill) — especially those featuring Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) — look for all the world as if they came straight out of Sergei Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible. For that matter, Wormtongue might well have been visually modeled on Eisenstein’s Ivan. Also, check out the film’s amazing battle scenes — possibly the most stunning and beautifully logical of their kind ever committed to film — and you’ll see filmmaking obviously grounded in the combat scenes from Orson Welles’ Chimes at Midnight. Yet The Two Towers is ultimately very modern; a work of this scale could only have been possible through technological advances in the CGI realm — the film, in fact, offers the most convincing work of its kind to date. Forget the computer-generated Yoda in Lucas’ Attack of the Clones and all previous efforts to meld CGI characters with real actors; The Two Towers delivers the goods. The movie’s CGI-created character Gollum is wholly believable as a real entity interacting with the live actors. Indeed, Andy Serkis (who provides the voice of the hyper-paranoid Gollum, and who also served as the model for the character’s movements) is so convincing and so powerful in the role that Serkis — who doesn’t actually appear in the film — is being suggested for Best Supporting Actor consideration! Possibly even more remarkable is the film’s depiction of the enigmatic tree creatures the Ents. The image of ambulatory trees — no matter how well done — could easily have toppled over into the risible, but Jackson and his co-writers have deftly sidestepped this possibility by taking a tip from Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien, and making the creatures amusing from the onset. By having it take nigh on forever for the Ents to conclude that Pippin and Merry aren’t the enemy Orcs, and by reworking Tolkien’s dialogue concerning the length of time it takes the Ents to say anything in their own language (“We do not say anything … unless it is worth taking a long time to say and to listen to” ), the film invites us to deliberately laugh with it so that we don’t laugh at it. It’s a brilliant stroke, and it pays off handsomely. But it’s just one of many brilliant strokes by a filmmaker who isn’t afraid to run the risk of looking foolish — and as a result, almost never does. Instead, Jackson reaches out and touches on true greatness. The Two Towers is, after all, a huge movie, and everything about it ought to be huge. What is perhaps most remarkable is the film’s position as the developmental center of the Lord of the Rings saga Jackson is telling; as such, it lacks both a proper beginning and ending in itself. And yet it never feels incomplete. The movie is whole unto itself, even though its lacks the first film’s sense of concluding on an emotional high point. Go see The Two Towers for yourself — and then see it again. Let it amaze you with its wonders, its size and its rich complexity. There is so much to admire in this film that you could see it a dozen times and come away from each viewing with something new.
