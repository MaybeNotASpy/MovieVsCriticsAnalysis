Oct 31 2023,positive, if you approach life with the general philosophy that any godzilla movie is a good godzilla movie theres only one film to really challenge such an assumption 1998s godzilla tristars muchmaligned hollywoodfinanced foray into the classic kaijus mythology the film was director roland emmerichs followup to his seminal 1990s disasterpiece independence day and arrived at the end of a very long very arduous development process by many creative teams who mostly agreed on one thing the japanese version of godzilla simply wouldnt appeal to american audiences and by changing everything about the character theyd arrive at something better in the 25 years since  which include a new trilogy of hollywood movies featuring a more loreaccurate godzilla and another halfdozen tohoproduced adventures  its pretty clear their instincts were entirely wrong most fans still rag on this project as the nadir for the character on the silver screen the new american films continue to grapple with the legacy of the choices made by emmerich and company zilla as the monster featured in this godzilla has come to be called in toho licensing has gone on to feature in a reasonably successful cartoon in which his invulnerability atomic breath and innate heroism were restored otherwise zilla only ever appears in comics and films as a submissive foe for classic versions of godzilla to trample over for fan service culturally its failure is total when i revisited the film a few years ago during the development of my original are you there godzilla its me evan series of essays i ranked it at the bottom of the entire series of threedozen features revisiting it this year i actually ended up moving it up a few spots  toward the middle of the bottom above such languid turds as godzilla vs spacegodzilla godzilla vs megaguirus and the entire trilogy of animated bores released by netflix in the last few years say what you will  and theres a lot to say  but emmerichs amoral instinct for largescale destruction means that however dumb his take on godzilla gets its at least never boring the film opens with what has now become the quintessential opening to all american takes on the character  opening credits overlaying flashes of hbomb footage and secret documents implying an untold consequence of the late 20thcentury atomic age and nuclear testing theres even a protomonarch of sorts the clandestine paramilitary organization in newer films that allow humans a reason to interact with kaiju although in this film its just the french secret service after the opening were introduced to the helping heap of human characters who see their lives torn apart by the arrival of godzilla matthew broderick stars as dr niko nick tatopoulos a nuclear biologist and expert in irradiated animal habitats his knowledge makes him indispensable to the american and french forces alike maria pitillo stars as his exgirlfriend audrey an aspiring reporter in new york city whose connection to nick gives her access to scoops their narratives weave together throughout godzillas rampage and they each bring with them their own supporting casts including turns by kevin dunn as a colonel harry shearer as a cameraman and michael lerner as mayor ebert an overt parody of film critic roger ebert with whom emmerich had beef at the time its a fun cast that nobody would ever call stacked but theyre adequate to keep the story moving for the first hour or so it does godzilla approaches and eventually attacks new york city weaving in and out of the buildings concrete canyons in a way not really depicted in the franchises other films this godzilla moves like a large irradiated iguana built for speed rather than destructive might he lacks fire breath or invulnerability most problematically he lacks personality as well that isnt a problem when its just emmerich doing his destructive dances but really hampers everything that happens in the back half traditionally godzilla appeared as an allegory for the nuclear destruction wrought on japan at the end of the second world war the original 1954 film ended with dr serizawa developing an even stronger weapon to kill godzilla and dying to prevent it from being used in war by anyone subsequent appearances diluted the metaphor but successfully transitioned the famous monster into a variety of roles  villain hero antihero or even a symbol of entirely different thematic concerns as of 1998 toho studios version of the character had died permanently in 1995s godzilla vs destoroyah in an antinuclear weapons story that nearly turns tokyo into chernobyl due to mankinds thoughtlessness even in his most shallow classic incarnations the king of monsters serves a role in the story both abstract and physical the problem with emmerichs godzilla is that once the first attack concludes he and dean devlin his creative partner at the time never crack what the rest of the story is actually supposed to be about resulting in a flailing action movie that starts repeating itself while introducing new unwanted and contradictory elements the 23minute sequence under madison square garden featuring miniature godzillas is the most difficult to square with the films insistence that audiences sympathize with godzilla as a simple trapped animal if its truly going to continue reproducing theres no choice but to exterminate it sad as that might be theres no reckoning with mankinds responsibility for the mess theyre in either it becomes a lot of whizbang special effects fun without anything grounding it not to mention the fact that the entire sequence is just a riff on the actually scary velociraptor content in jurassic park just a few years earlier fans have always complained that godzilla isnt a real godzilla movie because the character is so different than the traditional approach thats a pretty fair complaint and i pretty much agree that said emmerich is good at what he does and the first half is a really entertaining film that hits most of the necessary firstact beats for a kaiju movie i love the insistence that new york is trapped in an endless rainstorm a nice atmospheric touch that im sure did double duty as a way to save on visual effects if they could just render their version of big g in a hazy halflit environment the mayor ebert stuff is shameless and silly i dont actually dislike broderick as dr nick either he brings an everyman feel to the role that feels in keeping with traditional godzilla storytelling in fact the bare bones of the human relationships are pretty square with classic showaera archetypes the scientist the military the journalist all roles are needed to provide plotpropelling perspectives in a genre story i dont mind them at all here its simply that the film loses any steam halfway through and never recovers ive seen some critics hypothesize that the lack of an american trauma meant filmmakers had nothing to pull from for their version of godzilla i think thats a fair take although its not like 2014s godzilla nailed its allegory either had the 1998 version arrived three years later im sure emmerich wouldve mined the events of 911 for some fertile storytelling but then again we got plenty of that from michael bays transformers films which are as close as weve ever gotten to a truly spectacular post911 kaiju picture i guess cloverfield counts too but its not nearly angry enough to be the best of them at least to me can you imagine how magnificently stupid a michael baydirected godzilla film would have been maybe released in 2008 or so can you oh god i need to stop talking im getting flustered look as someone who subscribes to the notion that there are no bad godzilla films ok besides those anime movies i still find the best bits of godzilla to be good enough to make the entire thing worth sitting through every few years i actually like zillas design too and im always happy to see him show up maybe im tasteless but the truth is i just really love godzilla whatever form he takes 1998s godzilla was released on 4k uhd for the first time a few years ago this is the same release with the same special features the only difference is a very spiffy new steelbook with very gorgeous artwork its not a bad addition to any steelbook collection and a nice way to have the 1998 film stand out in any collection if you havent already purchased the film in this format the highresolution master looks great although it does call into stark relief the age of the monster cgi in many sequences and the aforementioned environmental and weather choices look gorgeous with the proper system this is fundamentally a disaster movie watch it the best way you can special features include the original teaser trailers great for 1990s nostalgists i guess as well as an audio commentary track with the visual effects supervisors a compilation of godzilla fight sequences a music video for the wallflowers unbearable cover of david bowies heroes and a behindthescenes documentary
Oct 28 2023,negative, black sabbath 1963 if youve ever laid awake at night wondering how exactly the heavy metal band black sabbath came up with its name ponder no more yet serving as inspiration for ozzy and friends is the least of this classics merits despite making a handful of films in the interim i tre volti della paura its original italian title translated as the three faces of fear most confirmed the promise that writerdirector mario bava demonstrated with his influential 1960 hit black sunday first the good news kino has reissued the film on bluray now the addendum it has reissued the american cut it released in 2015 not the original italian version it offered in 2013 the actual edits are mostly minor as the biggest change is that the  gasp  lesbian subtext in the italian cut has been completely removed for us consumption but this anthology film with boris karloff serving as the cheerful host is most effective in its original sequencing which progresses in story terms from good to better to best  in the american version its been rearranged from best to good to better solution program your player to follow the order below the telephone is a taut thriller as the title device connects the beautiful rosy michele mercier her jilted lover mary lidia alfonsi and an escaped convict out for revenge the wurdulak based on a piece by tolstoy rekindles that black sunday ambience in a period tale that stars karloff himself as the patriarch of a family plagued by vampires and the drop of water adapted from a chekhov story features what might be the creepiest corpse in cinema history as a nurse jacqueline pierreux makes the mistake of swiping a valuable ring from the body of a newly deceased clairvoyant godzilla 1998 forget the emmywinning tv special liza with a z  here we have the razziewinning theatrical stinker godzilla with a zzzz actually the title is simply godzilla although a better moniker would have been godzilla vs ferris bueller since the oversized monster proves to be no match for matthew brodericks incessant shtick an overhyped overproduced overeverything chunk of synthetic entertainment this american update of the beloved 1954 japanese classic immediately makes it clear that it was made for dumdums an opening scene features a sign marked chernobyl and then writerdirector roland emmerich and writerproducer dean devlin add a credit that reads chernobyl ukraine lest stateside viewers confuse it with i dunno chernobyl south carolina or something at any rate the majority of the action takes place in nyc where the leapin lizard and a buncha baby zillas dont ask square off against such imposing figures as a nerdy scientist broderick a french insurance agent jean reno on board to attract and appease the increasingly significant global audience and mayor ebert michael lerner an overweight candymunching guy whos always giving the thumbs up sign and whose balding assistant is named gene alas the heavyhanded critical bashing did not extend to the inclusion of a religious wacko named medved who gets flattened by godzilla this lumbering bore runs a tedious 138 minutes  in that same span one could watch the infinitely superior 1969 animated short bambi meets godzilla approximately 92 times and be all the better for it extras in the 4k  bluray  digital code steelbook edition include audio commentary by visual effects supervisors volker engel and karen goulekas all time best of godzilla fight scenes and the music video for the wallflowers heroes the last voyage of the demeter 2023 its an interesting slant for a dracula flick akin to offering a behindthehamletscenes peek with rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead presenting the norwegian pov with the thing prequel also called somewhat daftly the thing or retaining the perpetually dropped arctic sequences for mary shelleys frankenstein and the obscure but worth catching mid70s swedish production terror of frankenstein the last voyage of the demeter takes one sliver the captains log from bram stokers dracula  and spins an entire movie out of it set aboard the merchant ship demeter it charts the terrifying events that transpire as the ship journeys from eastern europe to london with its only cargo being big boxes of dirt as the sailors disappear one by one its up to the captain liam cunningham and a cambridgeeducated doctor corey hawkins to piece together the mystery as with 2018s ophelia the puzzle pieces dont always fit together between the adaptation and the original source material  for instance the film version includes an unexpected female passenger aisling franciosi a detail stokers captain surely would have mentioned  but for the most part this is a compelling terror tale that retains the flavor of stoker but adopts the pattern of alien the tagline might as well have been at sea no one can hear you scream the vampire played by spanish genre actor javier botet isnt in the suave lugosilee vein these puns they write themselves but rather more like max schrecks and klaus kinskis grotesque nosferatu and superb effects work help bring the creature and its surroundings to vibrant life bluray extras include audio commentary by director andré øvredal troll hunter and producer bradley j fischer a makingof featurette deleted scenes an alternate opening and a piece on the visual effects the mist 2007 the mist marks writerdirector frank darabonts third adaptation of a stephen king property and because hes not shooting for oscar gold this time around the previous titles were the enjoyable but grotesquely overrated pair the shawshank redemption and the green mile hes able to ease up on the pedal of selfimportance and deliver a bstyle genre flick  albeit one offering some evaluations of human nature in between all the bloodletting owing a nod in the direction of john carpenters nifty chiller the fog this concerns itself with a group of people who are gathered at the local supermarket when a mist envelops the entire area it soon becomes clear that something evil resides in the fog and the shoppers decide that they should remain indoors rather than venture out into the parking lot its here that the story reveals its cynical roots as a religious zealot named mrs carmody marcia gay harden converts many of the frightened survivors to her mode of thinking a path that leads to a jim joneslike environment and at least one human sacrifice propelled by hardens scary performance mrs carmody is a genuine threat and she validates the contention that times of crisis are as likely to turn people against each other as they are to unite them against a common enemy the pessimism also extends to other areas of the script most notably that powerhouse ending the new 4k uhd  bluray  digital edition theres also a steelbook edition available only at best buy contains both the original color version as well as an alternate blackandwhite version extras include audio commentary by darabont and producer denise huth a makingof featurette a conversation between king and darabont deleted scenes and pieces on the visual effects night of the demons 1988  night of the demons 2 1994  night of the demons 3 1997 ive always been amused by the part of the tagline for night of the demons that reads angela is having a party jason and freddy are too scared to come of course were this true it would reveal messieurs voorhees and krueger to be complete cowards as theres not a frightening moment to be found in any of the pictures in this trilogy thats not meant as a knock just as an acknowledgment of the sort of lowbudget horror yarns were dealing with here a perennial presence on videostore shelves back in the era night of the demons finds goth girl angela amelia kinkade opting to throw a halloween party at hull house an abandoned funeral home rumored to be filled with an unspeakable evil the usual assortment of moviestereotype clods assemble  the jock the good girl the tough greaser the chubby guy the sexpot genre fave linnea quigley etc  but once a séance is held and angela eventually gets possessed all hell breaks loose this is too silly to generate any semblance of unsettling atmosphere but the monster makeup is effective the cast is engaging if sometimes amateurish and there are a few intentional laughs thrown about i first and until now last saw this on vhs back in the late 80s and the only parts i could recall over the decades were the bookend scenes featuring that grumpy old man and his how do you like them apples comeuppance night of the demons made back its budget and then some so i expect it was a handful of factors besides box office including the passage of time that found both of its sequels debuting on video rather than theatrically in the case of night of the demons 2 thats perhaps a shame since it proves to be the best in the series while still plagued by some of the issues that prevented its predecessor from soaring and scoring more highly it does feature the best cast and the most interesting characters the demonic angela kinkade returns to torture some more teens that dare visit hull house on halloween but this time she meets a formidable opponent in sister gloria jennifer rhodes a nononsense nun who has no problem emulating rambo by gunning down the opposition with super soakers filled with holy water the series suffers a drastic drop with night of the demons 3 with a workable story diluted by clumsy pacing dopey dialogue and a tacky visual scheme on the run from the law several kids some guilty some innocent hide out at hull house where angela kinkade is waiting to cause more pain and suffering while this letdown was the last in the original series a remake of the 1988 flick did appear in 2009  starring american pies shannon elizabeth as angela and featuring a cameo appearance by quigley it was a massive bomb all three films are sold separately as collectors editions with the original offered as a 4k uhd  bluray package while the sequels are bluray only extras on night of the demons include a trio of audio commentaries by director kevin s tenney and select cast and crew members the international cut of

paramount scares volume 1 19682022 the first in what the studio hopes to be a series of 4k creaturefeature sets paramount scares offers five of its popular horror flicks covering a span of just over half a century adapted from the novel by hitmaker ira levin the stepford wives the boys from brazil rosemarys baby 1968 marked the first american film for polish writerdirector roman polanski who had already scored internationally with the likes of knife in the water and repulsion this box office hit emerged as one of the best chillers of its decade and it still serves as a touchstone of the modern horror film mia farrow in the finest performance of her often erratic career and john cassavetes star as rosemary and guy woodhouse who move into a trendy nyc apartment where their new neighbors include a nosy but apparently wellmeaning elderly couple ruth gordon and sidney blackmer rosemary is elated when she becomes pregnant  even if she is confused about a particularly disturbing sex dream followed by scratches on her body the next morning  but she feels suffocated when it seems as if everyone is trying to take control of her life her paranoia magnifies as she comes to believe that the building residents are satanists who are after her unborn child a movie that builds momentum through its deliberate pacing rosemarys baby not only functions as a supernatural thriller but also predates many psychological works including several by david cronenberg that tap into the universal fear of having your own body rebel against you polanski earned an academy award nomination for best adapted screenplay and gordon won for best supporting actress as a teenager in the early 1980s i devoured stephen kings first dozen or so books yes including danse macabre before other interests led me to bail on tackling his next offering pet sematary i never did get around to reading it but while the plot specifics are reportedly almost identical i have to imagine it doesnt possess the same degree of daftness that permeates director mary lamberts screen version also named pet sematary 1989 showcasing a script penned by king himself it was the second time he adapted one of his own works following 1985s limp silver bullet this casts dale midkiff and denise crosby as louis and rachel creed two of the most irresponsible parents ever to stumble their way onto a movie screen their young daughter ellie blaze berdahl and especially their toddler gage mike hughes would be just as well off living on their own a point made clear once tragedy strikes the family and the adjacent pet cemetery a former indian burial ground with supernatural powers provides dad with a way to make everything ok again or so he thinks the premise is fascinating but lamberts leaden direction suspense is nowhere to be found weak performances from the leads and the frequently campy interludes is brad greenquists walking corpse supposed to be this ridiculous pretty much sink this one fred gwynne however is excellent as jud the folksy neighbor whose wellmeaning actions eventually lead to doom and gloom even as a huge ramones fan i gotta admit that the title song doesnt represent the band at its best sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street 2007 is an adaptation of stephen sondheims 1979 broadway smash but it hides its stage roots so thoroughly that it often feels like a piece created exclusively for the screen thats hardly a surprise given that for a spell anyway tim burton was one of our most visually adept filmmakers in refashioning sweeney todd for cinema he and scripter john logan creator of tvs penny dreadful crafted a big bold musical that functions as an upscale slasher film its bloody but also bloody good with the gore tempered by the melancholy love stories that dominate the proceedings johnny depp delivers a haunted performance as a barber who returns to london after 15 years in prison to exact his revenge on the judge alan rickman who ruined his life while helena bonham carter plays the lonely widow who aids him in his efforts as partnersincrime theyre perfectly matched he slits the throats of all who sit in his barbers chair while she grinds up the corpses to use in her popular meat pies burtons decision to stylize this film to within an inch of its life his most theatrical flourish is to retain a grand guignol sense of the melodramatic was sound resulting in a visual feast that dazzles even through the settings necessary grime depp and carter ably provide this rousing musical with the emotional heft necessary to prevent it from merely becoming an exercise in gothic chic earning oscar nominations for best actor and best costume design this won for best art directionset decoration given all the cinematic bloat these days a pareddown thriller would seem to be a blessing offering nothing more and nothing less than appreciated adrenalinepumping chills it worked several years ago when blake lively stood firm against a menacing shark in the shallows but the idea goes bellyup with crawl 2019 in this one alligators are the apex predators making life miserable for the humans as college swimmer haley keller kaya scodelario and her injured father dave barry pepper are trapped in the flooded crawlspace of daves florida home while a category 5 hurricane rages all around them initially theres some tension as haley and dave are hopelessly pinned down by these critters but because the script by brothers michael and shawn rasmussen never offers much variation and because director alexandre aja never provides a proper sense of the layout of the joint all excitement soon dissipates a few hapless humans wander into the frame to provide snacks for the gators but stripped of personalities and for the most part even names their ultimate fates mean little crawl is presumably meant to refer to the movements of both the alligators and the human protagonists but it might as well refer to the forward momentum of the movie itself its solemnity results in tedium and its best to turn to 1980s alligator instead embracing the more ludicrous aspects of the premise that picture was energetic and entertaining crawl on the other hand is mostly torpid and toothless if the sight of a person grinning like an idiot is enough to unnerve you then you might well be the target audience for smile 2022  me ill stick with jack nicholsons joker for my maniacal grimaces a psychological horror yarn that tries to cover up its slender storyline and lack of genuine thrills with an overreliance on obvious jump scares smile is yet another of those chillers see also evil dead rise malignant it comes at night dont breathe etc that tend to get overrated simply because there arent enough quality horror yarns these days to keep the niche reviewers sated smile is by no means bad and it initially maintains interest with its story of a supernatural entity that uses pain and trauma to jump from one person to the next but a repetitiveness eventually sets in especially with a running time of a full two hours and the ending is pretty lousy good performances help particularly sosie bacon daughter of kevin bacon and kyra sedgwick in the leading role even horror mavens who dont love all five of the included titles might want to spring for this impressively packaged set with its deep red exterior and inside goodies like a specially created issue of fangoria looking at the quintet of movies a paramount scares logo pin and a sticker sheet all five films are offered on 4k bluray and digital with sweeney todd making its uhd debut this set also brings over the numerous extras available on past releases including a retrospective piece on rosemarys baby audio commentary by lambert on pet sematary footage from a 2007 press conference for sweeney todd an alternate opening on crawl and deleted scenes on smile talk to me 2023 from robert wienes the hands of orlac to oliver stones the hand from the amicus portmanteau film dr terrors house of horrors to the splatter sequel evil dead ii disembodied hands have long been a mainstay in horror cinema its to the credit of writerdirector danny philippou and codirector michael philippou that theyve come up with a unique approach to the errant appendage casting it as the portal through which the living can communicate with  and become briefly possessed by  the dead when the teenage mia sophie wilde elects to try it out in the company of her friends she reestablishes a bond with her deceased mother alexandria stefensen that threatens not only her own relationship with her father marcus johnson but also those with her best friend jade alexandra jensen and jades younger brother riley joe bird considering the kids initially treat the supernatural shenanigans no differently than if they were playing a game of spin the bottle or trivial pursuit its difficult to immediately plunge into the storyline but once the philippous pour on the atmosphere and flesh out the characters the movie settles into its spooky groove efficiently winding its way toward a twilight zoneworthy capper the filmmakers deserve further credit for making their protagonist believably flawed and prone to making bad decisions  wilde is excellent in the role and shes matched by jensen and bird an australian production this was a stateside sleeper hit for a24 outgrossing all the studios previous pictures save lady bird uncut gems and champ everything everywhere all at once globally its second only to eeaao tombs of the blind dead 1972 a production between neighboring countries spain and portugal tombs of the blind dead original title la noche de terror ciego which translates as the night of the blind terror was a key film in spains robust horror cycle of the 1970s furthermore its success led writerdirector amando de ossorio to make three more movies in what became known as the blind dead series 1973s return of the blind dead 1974s the ghost galleon and 1975s night of the seagulls this first picture finds several folks foolishly hanging out at a desolate graveyard one which sees its inhabitants  a band of sadistic knights templar  rise from the dirt and search for fresh bodies to consume like the critters in a quiet place their sightlessness crows plucked out their eyes while they were hung out to die means they must locate their prey by sound alone character actions dont always make sense and the connective tissue a love triangle of sorts feels rushed but the authentic location shooting and the ghoul designs are topnotch this initially played the us in a heavily reedited version simply called the blind dead then in a particularly bizarre  and hilarious  bit of programming another distributor eyeing the grosses of the planet of the apes series decided to add a prologue explaining how the walking dead were once intelligent apes killed by humans and have now returned this cut was released as revenge from planet ape the bluray edition offers tombs of the blind dead in its original spanish as well as with an englishspanish hybrid soundtrack also on hand is the us theatrical cut the blind dead as well as the alternate opening sequence for revenge from planet ape other extras include three audio commentaries a feature on the spanish zombie flick and a still gallery the toxic avenger collection 19842000 or ta in 4k as its advertised directly on the box set itself and why shouldnt toxie be given the homevideo upgrade after all hes the star of troma entertainments most successful film so popular a character that its his unsightly mug that appears on the studio logo as its official mascot even three flop sequels havent diminished the appeal of the first superhero from new jersey created by troma cofounder lloyd kaufman and directed by kaufman and fellow founder michael herz the toxic avenger 1984 pretty much set the blueprint for all future movies from the indie studio broad comedy lots of gore smatterings of ta and enough nonpc material to make even howard stern blush the first film in the toxie franchise is far and away the best sporting a frenzied and freewheeling attitude that none of the followups were able to recapture mark torgl plays melvin ferd alternately melvin junko in other films a geeky weakling who works as the janitor at a health club in tromaville nj the homicidal jocks bozo gary schneider and slug robert prichard are particularly cruel to clumsy melvin and its their actions that cause him to fall into a vat of toxic waste thus transforming him into a mutated hulk mitchell cohen not to be confused with formertrumpflunkyturnedswornenemy michael cohen whose natural instinct is to fight evil the toxic avenger is so overthetop in everything from its violence to its villains that its impossible to take seriously and andree maranda scores as sara the blind woman who becomes toxies girlfriend the toxic avenger part ii 1989 and the toxic avenger part iii the last temptation of toxie 1989 were originally one long film before kaufman elected to slice and release as two pictures and this helps explain why the two works are of comparable crumminess everything is still in place  the blood the guts the gallows humor  but nothing quite works and the end sensation is depression more than anything else in part ii toxie john altamura until he was fired then ron fazio travels to japan to locate the father who abandoned him  the trip is actually a ruse by the chemical company apocalypse inc which seeks to take over tromaville while its resident superhero is away with part iii the title takeoff on the last temptation of christ is the most clever aspect of the movie the picture itself is as forced in its immoral mirth as its immediate predecessor with toxie now the unlikely spokesman for apocalypse inc until he comes to his senses and fights back the blind sweetheart in these two pictures now named claire instead of sara is played by artist and musician phoebe legere but shes not nearly as effective as maranda in the first film after skipping the 1990s completely the series returned with citizen toxie the toxic avenger iv 2000 a movie i find impossible to properly describe  or digest the opening act which mocks mentally challenged people and school shootings is beyond offensive and beyond belief and the gags couldnt possibly be any cruder its terrible  until its not at some point a specific brand of demented intelligence emerges and its easier to go with the flow as this thing progresses its set in a multiverse long before the mcu made the concept cool to the kids as toxie now played by david mattey finds himself switching places with the noxious offender also mattey the homicidal mutant who rules over amortville the blind girlfriend sara in one dimension claire in the other is now played by heidi sjursen the popular troma character of sgt kabukiman nypd paul kyrmse appears in support stan lee billed in the credits as peter parker serves as narrator nowdisgraced porn star ron jeremy appears as the tromaville mayor future guardians of the galaxy director james gunn pops up as dr flem hocking an obvious spoof of

kaufman cast interviews and the 135minute documentary apocalypse soon the making of citizen toxie the wicker man 1973 one of the most intriguing of all cult films to emerge from the 1970s the wicker man employs allegory and atmosphere to amplify its thin veneer of the supernatural  it registers as both a fantasy flick and a horror movie in our minds more than it does on the screen edward woodward best known stateside as tvs the equalizer stars as neil howie a humorless and devout christian who in his capacity as a police sergeant is called to the scottish island of summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12yearold girl hes shocked to learn that under the auspices of lord summerisle christopher lee in what the actor considered his best film and his best role the residents are all part of a pagan society and their upcoming harvest celebration requires the sacrifice of a virgin offering what ultimately can be seen as an examination of competing faiths  and tellingly the bleeding of one into the other  director robin hardy and scripter anthony shaffer offer up a heady stew of ambiguity and interpretation and the ending remains one of the most shocking in cinema incidentally ignore neil labutes ridiculous 2006 remake starring nicolas cage which shucks religion completely and instead fashions the tale as a battle between upstanding male dominance and wicked feminist doctrine oh but do check out best scenes from the wicker man on youtube its fantastic the wicker man has been reissued in a 50th anniversary steelbook edition that offers 4k uhd  bluray  digital code

old lady who runs a toy shop he benefits from the discovery of his fellow fugitive henry b walthall a scientist who has figured out a way to shrink human beings down to the size of dolls engaging special effects and another robust performance from barrymore five years after his oscarwinning turn in a free soul contribute to the fun bluray extras consist of film historian audio commentary the

command the top two spots in the credits but of course its thirdbilled claude rains character who dominates this story  in stature if not actual screen time numerous actors have played the part of the disfigured madman who haunts the paris opera house and while chaney remains the best and most frightening rains lands in the place position for his more sympathetic handling of the role nominated for

Oct 23 2023,positive, godzilla first appeared in film almost seven decades ago and since then has been in approximately forty feature films with more on the way  named the longest continuouslyrunning film franchise by the guinness book of world records the large lizardlike monster has been terrorizing cities all over the world since 1954 in 1998 writerdirector roland emmerich independence day brought his own version to the big screen and while originally planned as a trilogy it ended up being a oneoff film after disappointing reviews from fans and critics  as the movie celebrates its twentyfifth anniversary sony pictures home entertainment is releasing a limited edition 4k steelbook this week following french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific an unknown creature is spotted passing through the panama canal scientist niko tatopoulos matthew broderick ferris buellers day off is called in to investigate the matter and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant irradiated lizard has been created by the explosions godzilla then makes its way north landing in manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city  niko along with his college sweetheart audrey maria pitillo true romance cameraman victor hank azaria the simpson and french secret service agent philip jean reno léon the professional must determine exactly what is going on and how to stop the monster before it is too late one of the complaints about emmerichs version of godzilla was that it wasnt very serious instead taking on a somewhat more tongueincheek slant to the subject matter of course that would explain brodericks casting in the lead role as he is well known for his comedic acting talent he does a very good job with the material he is given while remaining true to his strengths  reno offers a good performance while showing a little of his comedic side and azaria rounds out the male trio again using the comedic timing he is known for  pitillos performance along with a number of the other supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired even though godzilla was released in 4k four years ago this latest update is the best version technically so far  with dolby vision video quality the picture is clean and detailed even during the darker scenes taking place at night the color palette offers a variety of hues and shading giving the film additional depth  unfortunately the downside of the upgrade is that the effects stand out  not in a good way  and many of the greenscreened scenes are much more obvious than in past versions the special effects and less serious overall tone made this godzilla less beloved than previous and sincereleased versions but if taken with a grain of salt and recognizing that this one was meant to be a little lighter fare  it can be entertaining if you open your self up to it  i do understand the complaints regarding the look of the giant creature but if the viewer can get past that there are definitely some laughs to be had  the steel book is beautifully done and as this version is the cleanest visually and aurally to date it is worth purchasing for more information about godzilla visit the flickdirect movie database this release has been provided to flickdirect for review purposes                  for more reviews by allison rose please click here allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Feb 15 2023,negative,  what the new monstrously budgeted godzilla brings home is that size doesnt matterthat tacky crudeness harnessed to a real vision can have more brute power than all the stateoftheart computer wizardry that hollywoods money can buy this time the title titan is a devilvisaged lizard who convincingly wrecks manhattan lays a load of eggs that hatch velociraptorlike little ie 9foot dinosaurs and gets nailed on his way to brooklyn by a coalition of scientists the military and the french secret service dont ask the movie directed and cowritten by roland emmerich the teutonic schlockmeister who awed or stupefied the world with independence day 1996 isnt entirely lame the way the beast is finally snared has a certain architectural piquancy and sequences of the great lizard winding among skyscrapers as if theyre hedges in a lawn mazehis tail sheering off floors as it whips around cornershave been engineered with bravura otherwise size really is about all that this tedious underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it its brain remains disproportionately teensy  its no big news that in the japanese godzilla or gojira the creature played by a guy in a rubber suit stomping around a miniature tokyo was a metaphor for the abombs that leveled hiroshima and nagasaki even in the american edit with raymond burr tacked on as a portentous reporter the aura of mourning was palpable godzilla is the only cheesy disaster flick that feels as if it was made by people whod actually lived through some kind of horrific devastation and even after countless sequels of escalating sillinessin which the monster became japans savior battling other mutant reptiles and space aliens and rescuing japanese boys whod call out in laughably dubbed english thanks godzilla come back soongodzilla retained a nuclearhaunted nobility im not just endorsing retrochic when i say that the guy in the rubber suit is more fun for my money hes also scarier i dont want an anatomically correct godzilla the original godzilla is a dragon a mythical destroyer whos close in spirit to the jewish legend of the golemthe colossal indestructible clay man summoned up out of all the dark forces of this world who cant be destroyed by any of this worlds weapons the godzilla who lumbers through a metropolis on two legs erect slowly crushing cars and knocking over buildings robotically training his radioactive breath on anything and everything he sees is a mythical vision of armageddon the new downtoearth godzilla is much closer to the tyrannosaurus of jurassic park and to american giantmonster pictures such as the beast from 20000 fathoms hes almost never erecthe stoops to incinerate hes supposed to be smart he can outswim torpedoes and dodge heatseeking missiles which take out the chrysler building among other manmade wonders and just when people say whew i think i lost him he pops out from some cunning hiding place and gobbles them down so why does he still strike me as a less than formidable opponent well any forefather and given his reproductive capacities foremother of a new species that chooses to travel halfway around the globe to lay his eggs in the middle of manhattan doesnt seem built to survive evolutionarily speaking emmerich cribs his basic suspense techniques the lowangle camera riding in on openmouthed spectators from spielbergs jaws and jurassic park his egg imagery from alien his marauding baby dinosaurs from gremlins and a scene of the us army striding through some south seas devastation from apocalypse now whats uniquely his own is the way the havoc periodically grinds to a halt to make room for relationship scenes in which the characters maintain a soapopera obliviousness to everything crumbling skyscrapers firebreathing beasts but their feelings  oh yes there are human characters sort of matthew broderick that charmingly worried wise guy plays an expert in radioactive genetic mutations he stays heroically credible even as the film grows insanely incredible as when he has to pretend to outrun the rampaging 30story godzilla for half the length of manhattan island in a tiny yellow cab the other performances are as crude as the writing although hank azaria brings terrific bonhomie to the part of a daredevil tv cameraman and the brilliant harry shearer doesnt entirely disgrace himself as a pompous anchorman as a member of brodericks team the spiky forward redhead vicki lewis could have walked off with the picture if she hadnt been brushed aside in favor of a dumb blond aspiring tv reporter played by maria pitilloa sitcom actress who cant utter a line without the left side of her mouth curling up in valley girl incredulity or down in valley girl petulance contrary to what you might have read or awaited hopefully mayor ebert and his contentious aide siskel do not get squashed which brings me to another wellknown critic aristotle who at the dawn of western drama deemed spectacle the mediums least important component its true that cinema is a less cerebral form and that much of what aristotle considered a thrilling night out would make us commit suicide out of boredom but if as a filmmaker youre going to make spectacle the top priority youd better show us stuff weve never seen before youd better keep those miracles coming or were apt to grow nostalgic rather quickly for the days of spaceships on wires and monsters in rubber suits
Feb 15 2023,negative,unfortunately the movie teeters precariously between camp and serious without finding its balance

Feb 15 2023,negative,this newest look at the radiationcreated creature who once razed tokyo continues to advance the art of digitalefx to a jawdropping degree yet it offers little else 
Feb 15 2023,negative, size does matter say the makers of godzilla but somebody should have told them that its dangerous to boast and that personality also counts it would be fun to report that godzilla is a 400foottall turkey in lizards clothing but the truth is that its just rather dull the writingproducingdirecting team of roland emmerich and dean devlin have made a successful career out of plundering the bmovie archive for ideas which could be spiced up with a little 1990s technology it worked for them with the enjoyably trashy scifi fantasy stargate and it certainly hit paydirt with independence day with their talent for reinventing and reinvigorating hoary old genres the pair must have seemed the ideal choice to tackle this particular remake but whether through hubris or a simple lack of imagination the formula fails to fizz this time the echoes of other movies frankenstein king kong jaws and aliens spring immediately and forcefully to mind are all there but they just serve to remind you that the originals were rather better and the creature itself seems uncomfortably closely related to the inhabitants of jurassic park another problem is the films colour palette the breezy bright colours of independence day are replaced by brooding dark colours and deep shadows most of the action takes place at night and the daytime scenes are filmed under lowering clouds and torrential rain in a look akin to that of rain city in seven  an interesting technical challenge perhaps although one suspects it might have something to do with covering up the shortcomings of the digital effects but hardly what one expects from a summer blockbuster even worse the plotting seems designed to make sure well never get too excited the opening is fine with plenty of ominous foreboding as the mysterious creature is sighted making its way up the eastern seaboard of the united states with the nuclear theme of the original updated to the 1990s the french shoulder most of the blame for godzillas mutation caused by their nuclear tests in the pacific tension is effectively built as the creature heads for its unknown destination at least its unknown if you havent seen one of the zillion trailers and teaser ads but once godzilla gets to new york things fall apart very quickly manhattan is evacuated while the creature hides out in the citys subways avoiding all military attempts to flush him out and were forced against our will to follow some rather dreary human interest in the shape of matthew broderick as the scientist who comes to understand whats going on and maria pitillo in what is already becoming the cliched role of the year the ambitious young tv reporter jean reno is running around in the background as a mysterious french secret agent making heavyhanded deeply unfunny jokes about bad american coffee sooner or later of course they all have to head for the city and face the monster but it takes an awfully long time is there any reason on earth why a film like this should be two hours and 19 minutes long at 90 minutes emmerich and devlin might conceivably have had an exciting movie size matters all right but not the way they seem to think long long ago in a kingdom far away a famous and venerable animation studio seemed to have lost the art of making good movies but all that changed when the overhauled and revived disney corporation released the little mermaid eight years ago reversing the received wisdom that the age of the animated feature was over and setting the standard for a string of huge hits in the 1990s not that any of this will matter too much to most of the audience for this welcome rerelease  but its worth remembering the doldrums into which disneys animation division had sunk before the little mermaid turned things around while noting that it still looks like one of the best modern offerings from the studio the underwater sequences are absolutely wonderful the story is classically simple and the whole thing is mercifully free of the schlocky subpc hokum of later offerings like pocahontas even the songs are rather good and the intimate scale of the whole thing makes one wonder whether all the fancy computergenerated panoramas of more recent productions are at all necessary a pleasure from start to finish and a film that should thrill the new generation born since the original release after the turbulence of the immediate postgorbachev years when it seemed that one of the worlds great film cultures might be swept away entirely russian cinema has been experiencing a modest but definite resurgence a few months after sergei bodrovs fine prisoner of the mountains was shown at the ifc pavel chukhrais exquisitely made film set during the harshest years of postwar stalinism confirms the trend ekaterina rednikova plays katya a young war widow with a sixyearold son sanya misha philipchuk aboard a train she meets handsome rogueish army officer tolyan vladimir mashkov and the two begin a sexual relationship which sets them against the rigid oppression of the police state the unfolding developments of the story are so masterfully handled that it would be wrong to reveal any more but the thief skilfully and believably interweaves its three protagonists lives with the stark reality of their predicament chukhrai has said that he wanted to make a film about the childhood of the generation which has had such a strong influence on life in this country today and the point is rammed home in a rather heavyhanded coda in which we see sanya as a middleaged army officer marshalling his troops in the midst of what looks like a savage chechenstyle civil war its an addition which seems unnecessary although perhaps not to a russian audience but it certainly doesnt detract from this melancholic beautiful film whose images linger in the mind for a long time
Feb 15 2023,negative, after cannes 50th anniversary last year i wrote that the worlds most prestigious film festival is defined by the most extreme contradictions culture and glamour art and commerce sunny beaches and dark theaters critical debate and crass dealmaking challenging cinema and mainstream product yes and its also crowded as hell this years 12day marathonincluding 22 films in competition dozens more in various sidebar packages and several hundred others screened around town for market purposesdrew 4000 journalists fans flacks and industry bottomfeeders making it extremely timeconsuming if not impossible or dangerous to walk from one end of the croisette to the other the quintessentially hollywoodian primary colors kicked off a fest that also included four french and four american movies in competition for the juried palme dor these bigticket titles ostensibly help to underwrite one film each from china taiwan greece and russianone of which has big stars or a fair chance of earning commercial distribution in the us or france not for nothing was godzilla selected as the closingnight film even though by any other standard the choice was indefensible but cannes in may isnt cannes its planet hollywood the insanity of the daily schedule the banality of the redcarpet parade and the inevitability of needing to choose one film over another makes disappointments all the more profound atrocities all the more hateful you can spend a sweaty 15 minutes darting from one screening to another often with 50 pounds of pr in tow only to find that the movie is less than you hoped or worse little at this years festival approached true greatness despite some worldclass talents in competition taiwanese master tsai mingliangs the hole was typically minimalistso much so that a dramatic high point of the first halfhour was a characters cough ken loachs my name is joe was a minor work but its hotheaded everyman protagonist peter mullan who quits the sauce and romances a sweet social worker rang true hou hsiaohsiens the flowers of shanghai a snailpaced portrait of brothel life in late 19thcentury shanghai was one of the festivals most challenging films at least a quarter of the audience walked out before it was over even terry gilliams fear and loathing in las vegas fell short of his best films but johnny depps shabbyclothed journalist outsider provided the festivals most resonant critique the mentality here is so massively atavistic that crimes often pass unnoticed indeed alienated outsiderdom emerged as the festivals theme patrice chereaus those who love me can take the train was a wildly overwrought melodrama about an extended family whose every member has some sexual problem homosexuality transvestitism female hysteria claude millers the class trip depicted a young boys freudian daydreams but without dreaming much itself roberto benignis bizarre obnoxious life is beautiful turned from a featherweight slapstick comedy into a more upbeat schindlers list making it perhaps the closest well come to seeing jerry lewis notorious unreleased holocaust melodrama the day the clown cried the outsider heroine of dance me to my songa woman with severe cerebral palsy played by a woman heather rose in the same conditionoffered one of the festivals true surprises rolf de heers unflinching direction notwithstanding this is indeed a film by heather rose who not only gives a fierce performance but also cowrote this harrowing lovetriangle variation on her life story the near 10minute standing ovation given to rose bodes well for a film that could tap some of the same reallife underdog appeal as its fellow aussie import shine on the other hand perhaps it would be better if rose werent embraced by planet hollywood by contrast todd solondzs happinessan ironicsarcastic title if there ever was onedepicts an endless amount of fear and loathing under the guise of the blackest comedy a cleancut suburban father dylan baker recalls a cathartic dream about gunning down random strangers then jerks off to a teen magazine a mother cynthia stevenson ends up tasting her boys first ejaculate to an extent one appreciates the directors view that america is sick suburbia is polluted most men are sickos some women are mean and pathetic and all children are victims but then what as in welcome to the dollhouse solondz successfully beats the viewer into submissionand so the cycle of abuse continues much better was lars von triers idioterne the idiots which proposes an odd solution to alienation impersonating retarded people as a rebellious means of raw selfexpression and subcultural fraternizing although the idiots is the uncredited second film in von triers newly formed cinema collective his name isnt on it this is unmistakably the work of the man who made breaking the wavesthe same aesthetic mix of jumpcuts seasick camerawork and washedout colors capturing the metaphoric story of people too delicate for this world fighting to assert themselves amidst the powers that be leave it to lodge kerrigan director of the bleak amerindie clean shaven to return us to the land of the lost kerrigans claire dolan is a tightly controlled nearly suffocating investigation of the life of a new york prostitute katrin cartlidge who struggles to put some distance between herself and her manipulative pimp colm meaney enlisting the aid of a scruffy cab driver vincent donofrio the theme all around is control and kerrigan certainly proves the master of his domain at the postscreening press conference the youngish auteur brooded impeccably stared at his water glass and generally looked like a guy who doesnt get out much after a week of nothing but screenings i believe i know how that feels halfway through actordirector john turturros boring illuminata i bolted just barely making it into a market screening of the buzz movie in competition the dreamlife of angels even though i watched from a cramped and crosslegged position on the floor of a tiny room this incisive study of the shifting relationship between two young french women was riveting seeming as real as any doc sony pictures classics picked it up for distribution meaning it may appear here before years end one night i blew off the festival entirely skipping the press screening of hal hartleys heinous henry fool in favor of a 30minute train ride to a tiny theater showing adrian lynes lolita as you probably know the child pornography prevention act passed congress making it illegal to show a minor having sex even with the use of a body double lyne strained to interest a us distributor before settling for a premiere on pay cable in august as lolita unspooled i wondered what it meant that much of the film excited me in a manner of speaking more than anything at cannes as massreleased alternative fare like good will hunting continues to make foreign art cinema an iffy prospect anywhere film cognoscenti visit festivals at any cost because surprises at home are few and far between at a panel discussion on the state of film criticism french critic michel ciment mentioned that last years quartet of cannes awardwinnerstaste of cherry the eel the sweet hereafter and happy togetherearned hardly any money in commercial release and yet that hasnt stopped people from coming to the festival in other words for critics whod rather seek hidden treasures than spend 52 weeks a year helping to announce whatever harvey weinstein and co consider a sound investment the film festival has become the last best arthouse but since that arthouse isnt open to the general public reporting on it means risking irrelevance or loss of employmentwhich only makes the situation worse probably the only reason to continue practicing film criticism is the naive hope that every so often what you write has some microscopic influence on widening the range of available product and if not well theres always miramaxs fall lineup speaking of which every once in a while the former indie companys clout lands a velvet goldminethat is a film by a smart iconoclastic politically minded director designed to subvert the status quo of visual narrative and sexual representation todd haynes hugely ambitious glitterrock epic stacks layer after layer of flamboyant artifice atop stardust memories of the 70s queer youth cultures yearning for chchchchangesprecisely the project of glam rock itself the investors were probably thrilled to hear that theyd be getting something like citizen kane meets boogie nights and performance but the roleplaying of the filmmaker and his actors including ewan mcgregor and christian bale is so extravagantly complexand the style so tantalizingly opaquethat not even the publicists meet the talent press luncheon could spoil the mystery of this goldmines rosebud on sunday about 30 of us gathered in front of the trinitron outside the press room to scribble down the names of the award winners befitting the jurys president martin scorsese the awards were evenly distributed haynes took the prix de meilleure contribution artistique best artistic contribution thanking oscar wilde and roxy music for giving us so much to aspire to hal hartley won the screenplay prize for henry fool john boorman was awarded best director for the general his soso biopic of irish thief martin cahill peter mullan took the actors prize for my name is joe while elodie bouchez and natacha regnier the young women from the dreamlife of angels split the best actress award roberto benigni won the grand prix for life is beautiful and knelt at scorseses feet and the topprize palme dor went to theo angelopoulos eternity and a daywhich seemed to last about that long now that the serious side of cannes is fini im headed for the grand théìtre lumière to battle the crowds for godzillawhich i could do just as easily at the hollywood 27 as the french would say plus ça change my plane doesnt leave for two more days but in a wayin the biggest wayim already home mr spielberg the attorney asked is character development important to the success and popularity of an action film unfortunately its not important no spielberg replied take jurassic parkpeople went to see that movie over and over again because of the dinosaurs not because the kids had a nice scene where they sat in a tree at night and talked for three minutes cmon steven people went to see jurassic park the first time because of the special effects but they went back again and again and then bought the video because of the characters jeff goldblums spacedout scientist and richard attenboroughs jolly media magnate have their own appeal but especially strong are the dinosaur personalitiesthe cutebutdeadly campys the ruthless raptors spielberg is downplaying character development in the abovequoted exchange because hes a defendant in a lawsuit alleging that the script for twister was plagiarized the final script is like 5 percent of the success of the movie he calculates disingenuously but if he believes that hes forgotten why jaws raiders of the lost ark and jurassic park are great movies and why the characterlight sequel the lost world isnt roland emmerich and dean devlin the creative team behind godzilla subscribe to the school of oneshot moviemaking create a special effect so monstrously huge that the entire world will have to see it once who cares if after the opening weekend numbers are toted up anyone will want to see it again or buy the video emmerich and devlin never intend to make a king kong in which the monster grabs hold of our imagination and achieves immortality through his tragic personality as they showed in stargate and independence day they only want to take seven bucks off half the countrys moviegoers and scramand for that you dont need character development so their godzilla created by french nuclear testing in the south pacific take that france makes his way very quickly to manhattan where people run for their lives and tractortrailers are crunched in mighty jaws then the borough is evacuated offscreen unfortunatelynow that would have been a movie helicopters chase the monster around in scenes designed to provide a basis for the upcoming video game meanwhile soldiers scientists and the obligatory venal politician mayor ebert with his assistant genetake that critics try to figure out how to kill the beast matthew broderick plays an expert on nuclear mutations who figures out all the important plot points like zillas pregnancy after the first half hour with its witty references to the toho studios original movies godzilla becomes an exercise in bad pacing studded with freefloating good ideas its great to see the monster swimming in the hudson river undulating like aquatic dinosaurs do in paleontological reconstructions its terrific to see his offspring struggling to corner on the slick floors of madison square garden but by the time we see these imaginative moments were so worn out by the movies buzzbomb approach to action and comic relief that were immune to further sensation emmerich cranks up the lumbering japanese monster to mach 2 and the editor and cinematographer are simply pulled along in its wake meanwhile auxiliary characters like maria patillo as brodericks love interest and hank azaria as a rogue cameraman are written as stereotypes so no time need be wasted getting to know them worst of all we feel nothing when the mighty godzilla bites the dust other than relief that the sensory assault is over why should we its just a cgi that emmerich devlin and maybe even spielberg think we dont want monsters to have personalities as strong as our fears only proves that they dont know what a monster movie is really about character counts and godzilla is a negative number
Feb 15 2023,positive,this is damn good aesthetic amusement its aliens and its jurassic park and its starship troopers its what we get now and maybe we should be thankful for the simplification 
Feb 15 2023,neutral,how do you screw up squish and aargh by spending more than 100 million on marvelous special effects another 50 million on a brilliant marketing campaign and then forgetting to invest any money on a logical script thats how 
Feb 15 2023,positive,you cant have everything especially in the cinematic summer season and when emmerich and dean are at their gleefully destructive best you really dont want everything popcorn fun is more than enough
Feb 15 2023,negative,its sodden state derives from its shameless assault on the moviegoing public this isnt art it isnt even great trash its a con game and we bear the claw marks
Feb 15 2023,negative,while the spectacular special effects are the obvious main attraction godzilla at more than two hours long is bogged down by paperthin characters and uninteresting subplots
Feb 15 2023,negative,the new american godzilla is a major disappointment its not quite the megahyped bust that the seinfeld finale was but its close
Feb 15 2023,positive,its hard to imagine godzilla  or any movie for now  topping titanic in popularity but godzilla which delivers unpretentious fun with a blithe spirit will surely give that boxoffice behemoth a healthy run for its money
Feb 15 2023,neutral,godzillas idea of wit is to have the new york city mayor and his assistant bear a suspicious resemblance to a pair of famous thumbwagging movie critics who panned independence day  although even that dim joke gets run into the ground
Feb 15 2023,negative,godzilla leaves nothing to the imagination it also leaves nothing much for its stars to do 
Feb 15 2023,positive,emmerich and devlin give this summers audiences a vigorous funny outrageous film that succeeds because it never ever takes itself too seriously 
Feb 15 2023,negative,godzilla is a clipjob on celluloid having swiped pages from nearly every disaster movie theyve ever seen emmerich and devlin try to draw attention away from their larceny by distracting product placements 
Feb 15 2023,negative,hollywood as usual has thrown another brainless and convoluted movie our way under the rubric of summer blockbuster thinking optional but never required 
Feb 15 2023,neutral,with every technological advantage at his disposal emmerich has made a movie that is so emotionally uninvolving you cant help but scrutinize every minor detail  most of which come up lacking
Feb 15 2023,neutral,the new godzilla is sleek and technically accomplished but the movie proves just how dull efficiency can be
Feb 15 2023,negative, cnn  ever since its promotional theatrical trailer was released last summer we have been teased taunted and tormented with tantalizing glimpses of the 1998 version of godzilla  weve also been told over and over again that size does matter there is no doubt that this lizard will be a cash cow for at least two or three weeks  then hopefully people will realize that the movies not worth their pocket change  or maybe when armageddon opens on july 1 the summer movie seasons second comet will land right on top of the big guy as in the original godzilla released in 1956 a nuclear bomb this one set off by the french mutates a harmless reptile into a  huge lizard thats big mean and has a thing for major cities instead of tokyo this monsters heading for the big apple the only thing in his way is half the us army the navy and ferris bueler i mean matthew broderick  he plays the worm guy an earnest scientist who studies the effects of radiation on worms  naturally hes also the worlds leading expert on giant nuclear lizards  we also have a little inside joke here  brodericks characters name is totopoulos which happens to be the name of the man who designed this version of godzilla filmmakers roland emmerich directorwriter and dean devlin producerwriter are great at eyepopping effects and at blowing up national landmarks but their films are lacking in character development  the main thing that made their megahit independence day work as well as it did was the wisecracking fighter pilot played by will smith there is no such character here  the closest standin we get is a mysterious french special agent played by jean reno who manages to get a few zingers in here and there as he helps brodericks character track down godzilla during the first hour godzilla had me right in the middle of his big scaly palm  the audience is continually teased with only glimpses of godzilla as he crosses the world eventually descends on lower manhattan and proceeds uptown smashing billions of dollars worth of real estate along the way but when the film moves from the lizard action into the humdrum lives of the people played by broderick pitillo and hank azaria who plays a news cameraman the films forward momentum skids to a stop basically this whole movie is derivative drivel yes the special effects are spectacular but theres not an original thought in evidence  emmerich and devlin have borrowed whole scenes from jaws star wars king kong and mighty joe young  then when we finally do see a fullframe shot of the lizard its a cross between jurassic parks raptors and sigourney weavers alien  hes a big boy  but oddly generic on top of everything the mayor of new york is named ebert as in roger and his chief aid is named gene as in siskel  theres even a little thumbs up thumbs down action at the end  this cheesy turkey is also a bit hammy  come to think of it this isnt a movie  its a delicatessen no matter what i or anyone else says this film is going to make gajillions of dollars and teenage boys from 12 to 60 will be lining up to see this monster mash  but for me godzilla ranks as a somebody else pays better yet make someone pay you to see it  i did
Feb 15 2023,neutral,without some heart or a decent story to accompany the spectacle all youre left with is a big screen twist on a brainmushing video game
Feb 15 2023,positive,fortunately godzilla delivers best what summer filmgoers want  a lot of astonishing special effects and the most intriguingly designed creature to hit the screen since the original alien
Feb 15 2023,positive,its basic blunt fare but executed with a sense of fun
Feb 15 2023,neutral,for all the hype about the newness of the monster there is little original about godzilla
Feb 15 2023,negative,the makers of godzilla obviously devoted so much manpower and time and energy and money to the admittedly fabulous special effects that they apparently had no budget left over for actors
Feb 15 2023,positive,the film doesnt spare anything when it comes to special effects that makes it fun to watch  for a while but the visual splash comes at the expense of everything else
Feb 15 2023,negative,this movie hopes the audience that gobbled up the pandemonium of jurassic park will dine on the premise of godzilla theyre the same kind of movie but where jurassic park was filet mignon godzilla is leftovers
Feb 15 2023,neutral,the filmmakers task here is to create charming trash out of expensive technology this clash of sensibilities gives the movie a split personality its neither campy enough to be a goof nor serious enough to alarm you
Feb 15 2023,negative,emmerich and devlin have made the worlds most elaborate b movie filled with everlarger action and specialeffects setpieces strung together by the merest whisper of a story beyond the expected lizardonarampage plot 
Feb 15 2023,negative,godzilla is worth seeing  the monster that is godzilla the film is a little less worthwhile considering the magnitude of its star this film is a very minor addition to the genre 
Feb 15 2023,positive,noisy popcorn fun enough but if size does matter this ultimately comes up short
Feb 15 2023,negative,godzilla is a dull film the humour as plodding as the creatures ponderous steps the script poorly thought through the action infelicitous the special effects less than breathtaking
Feb 15 2023,neutral,an oversized and overly long monster film that gives us a spectacular monster a monster that might be a little too big for its own good roland emmerich has a great godzilla and not much of a plot to put him in 
Feb 15 2023,neutral,theres little wit or subtlety here but the film does make a massive satisfying amount of noise
Feb 15 2023,neutral,yes size does matter and godzilla is just too darn long like the critter itself the movies bulk simply overwhelms its tiny brain
Feb 15 2023,negative,the new godzillas trouble is that so much technological wizardry and glossy craft add up to so little movie in this case too much is not nearly enough 
Feb 15 2023,neutral,a specialeffects show reel isnt a movie the story is nonexistent the dialogue is cheesy and the characters are as fake as the rubber suits that made up the original godzilla in 1956
Feb 15 2023,negative,slickly produced visually deft godzilla falters because it lacks soul 
Feb 15 2023,positive,the script may be barely functional but the film definitely delivers the goods as a superversion of a 50sstyle giant monster movie 
Feb 15 2023,negative,what keeps the movie from being a complete summer bummer is the grace of the monster itself but all the sound and fury of modern technical wizardry cant compensate for the films hollowness
Feb 14 2023,neutral,unfortunately godzilla cannot be on screen all of the films nearinterminable 140 minutes and when godzilla goes missing so does the film 
Feb 14 2023,negative,watch the film in its entirety and youre no longer a slave to the studio image and media speculation you can look beyond trailered glimpses of reptilian body parts to see godzilla for what it really is  a thrilllite plotless multiplex misfire
Feb 14 2023,negative,perhaps the most extraordinary achievement is to make the biggest monster the planet has ever seen hardly register at all on screen
Feb 14 2023,positive,this godzilla is finally about technology about how movies can weave together miniatures animatronics computergenerated images and yes men in rubber suits it is a marvel but also something of a noisy bore 
Feb 14 2023,positive,the films mighty overlong and at times a bit repetitive but some astonishing special effects will make you believe that a genderless giant can trash a great city 
Feb 14 2023,negative,godzilla is yet another special effects spectacular cued to the biffandsplat vibrations of the arcade game forget any notion of the action setpiece or the art of building towards a climax you wont find any of that nonsense happening here 
Feb 14 2023,neutral,the truth is weve seen it all before take away the gimmicks and you have an extremely simplistic story with rehashed characters
Feb 14 2023,neutral,emmerich and devlin seem to have created a new subgenre generic destruction
Feb 14 2023,negative,a cartoonish explosion  a monster show designed to make us gape in awe at such technical wizardry its all stomping and romping which will eventually tire out some viewers and pass the testosterone test for others 
Feb 14 2023,positive,whenever this sleek streamlined godzilla is whipping through the canyons of manhattan at 60 mph the movie is a hoot when homo sapiens rule its a snore 
Feb 14 2023,negative,godzilla fills its nonspectacle sequences with turgid emoting and plot shifts so clearly at the service of the special effects budget that they are painful to behold 
Feb 14 2023,negative,other than the way the giant lizard looks  which does turn out to be pretty spectacular  theres not a whole heck of a lot going on in this film 
Feb 14 2023,positive,this is what a summer spectacular should be big bold welltold
Feb 14 2023,negative,this new godzilla is about nothing but spending and making money it has actors without charm characters without depth jokes without wit science without brains action without a hint of plausibility 
Feb 14 2023,negative,in the end the godzilla that terrorized tokyo in the 50s is simply more fun 
Feb 14 2023,negative,the movie is breathtakingly unfunny and unscary it just sits there zombieeyed spittle dribbling down its chin 
Feb 14 2023,negative,whereas independence day had 15 minutes of special effects this is 140 minutes of nothing but techno tricks 
Feb 14 2023,negative,among hollywood blockbusters godzilla truly is a monster an astoundingly crass and brutal factory product that tramples over the audiences hearts and minds 
Feb 14 2023,negative,the muchheralded new godzilla is not much of an advance on the earlier one the big lizard looks like a refugee from jurassic park his offspring have strayed in from aliens and the humans are a terribly insipid bunch of nohopers
Feb 14 2023,negative,all at once godzilla becomes jurassic park 3 and alien 5 with a dash of scoobydoo the one thing it doesnt resemble is a godzilla movie
Feb 14 2023,positive,while emmerich hasnt mastered spielbergs baitandswitch routine he does know how to surprise godzilla is a dandy popcorn movie  just the thing to keep kids quiet for days
Feb 14 2023,neutral,nothing about the film is funny  or very exciting for that matter godzilla isnt bad its incompetent it just sits there even when its moving
Feb 14 2023,negative,for godzilla to really work his magic he must be a reflection of ourselves  a lost soul perverted by the wanton acts of modern man there is no connection here and thats why this movie like most modern monster movies fails miserably 
Feb 1 2023,negative,most of the films failings are banal ones  a paucity of dramatic invention and of human or reptilian emotion the story is as coldblooded as its subject 
Nov 23 2022,negative, its big its scaly and its not happy to be here godzilla stomped into local theaters this week to wreak havoc in manhattan and at the box office nuclear testing on distant islands of french polynesia has resulted in mutation of a lizard in that area this much we gather from the long opening credits sequence depicting the nuclear blast and viewing the defenseless lizards watching as their home and their lives are destroyed by the fiercest of foes man nick tatopoulos matthew broderick is a biologist studying nuclear mutation of various creatures his latest effort focuses on earthworms at chernobyl hes torn away from his work by american military operatives lead by colonel hicks kevin dunn tatopoulos is wanted to discover what this creature is that has shredded a fishing trawler and made tracks across in panama many of us have come to know godzilla as a cheesy japanese movie monster that wreaks havoc in japan however this incarnation of gojira is less cheesy and more explosive for the film to be successful the blowemup premises of independence day and men in black have to be shoved below the surface and the true cheekiness of godzilla exposed unfortunately director roland emmerich feels hes got a surefire hit with the destruction from id4 and the theft of ideas from park on the box office front his success is guaranteed godzilla will make a killing if those cheering little kids in the theater have anything to do with it the quality however is quite different theres not much in this film we havent seen before the effects are a combination of parks magnificent dinosaurs and the disappointing antiquated destruction from the end of id4 bad roles have been given to great actors matthew broderick and hank azaria they play their parts the best they can but its emmerichs directing that kills their shots at decent roles the most interesting portions of the film come in three sets of segments the first is the use of michael lerner and lorry goldman as roger ebert and gene siskel lookalikes lerner is mayor ebert manhattans rotund leader lorry goldman is gene eberts assistant they bicker throughout the film but its the sequence where ebert crows why do i even keep you around that marks one of the few bright spots in the film the use of french secret service agents to badmouth the americans and save the day is unique and finally turns the tables on the endless parade of antifrench sentiment that runs rampant through american humor at one point philippe jean reno the french agents leader is sampling coffee and spits it up i thought this was french roast one of his colleagues holding up an american can of coffee with the words french roast printed in large letters on it replies it is the final set is featured at the beginning and towards the end the sequences portray the lizards and especially godzilla as innocent creatures simply trying to live the only way they know how they are more human in characteristic than any of the human characters in the film in that way the film fails the characters become destructible things instead of keys to the film in the end its not the senseless destruction or the lives lost that we care about it is this giant lizard who we can only see as an innocent bystander hunted by a fearstricken race bent on destroying anything that threatens their way of life
Jun 25 2022,positive, while were a handful of days behind schedule the letterboxd files with yours truly has returned for another round of things that you couldve already read if you had a letterboxd and followed my account if you dont never fear id never deprive you of these painfully casual film blurbs i wouldnt even dare this week weve got elvis a spattering of william friedkin and wolfgang petersen because why not and more reviews from the vault because i have a job and didnt watch as many movies this week lmao baz you crazy sob elvis is a 159minute atomic blast of rhinestone glory genuinely unsure how austin butler pulled that off and how tom hanks was able to be so evil with that accent a stunner let luhrmann do whatever he wants for the rest of his career can we put to rest the idea walk hard made it to where you cant do a biopic like this anymore literally just hire someone as insane and opulent as baz luhrmann and nail the cast elvis is a rattler no idea how baz decided to put a denzel curry track in the elvis movie but i support maybe not my favorite petersen film but its pretty compelling when its showing the horrors of contagion and how futile we are to nature having actually lived through a pandemic and gotten the virus in question with tons of vaccine flowing through me it is fascinating to see the what if horrors of 90s imagining of what this might look like clearly its going off a disaster movies playbook and the military conniving feels a little trite for how something this serious would actually go but just having lived through a moment where us government severely mismanaged the opening stages of a pandemicincompetence and malevolence at the federal level dont feel that off petersen really found something to say with the state of our leadership at the top with his government trilogy this fire af1 and though this is the least effective of that trio its still a noxious reminder of how we pale in comparison to natures worst cute monkey too god bless wolfgang petersen for mounting such a thrilling phenomenally stupidyetsurprisingly deep studio blockbuster at a time where we need way more of that than spiderman 7 gary oldman snapping in every scene is a hoot i originally intended to only watch an hour of this but it was so magnetizing i couldnt do anything but finish it the classic 90s political thriller complete with an airtight script for 2 hours some great performances and a steady hand from wolfgang petersen i miss clint eastwood acting in other peoples movies just a grand time a scuzzy sundrenched la neonoir where nobody is good forever and everyone has something to hide obviously the car chase is a landmark which what else would you expect from the guy who made the french connection but i was equally impressed by friedkins ability to zap the film of any predictability its just a daring morally dubious copsandgrifters saga with one hell of a willem dafoe performance everything burns its stunning to me we used to live in a world where this was a major release from a movie studio sure it got stomped by star wars but what didnt in 1977 a clear pathway for movies like uncut gems and triple frontier and a whiteknuckle unforgiving descent into a very specific land of desperation one of the few movies where it felt like anything could go wrong at any moment and you feel that tension from opening to closing credits friedkin is a master of shot composition and in building that exact shade of gutwrenching tension that makes you want to yell at the screen theres something powerful that the film thats going to stand as the future of pixar is made by a team of amazingly creative women domee shi elite best directorial debut at pixar since lee unkrich doing toy story 3 staggering talent its got shades of scott pilgrim and aardman which is one of the higher compliments i can give a movie it nails the 2000s feel down to the fact that it feels like one of those 00s liveaction family films aimed at preteens thats a feat i usually dont give disney credit for creative risk anymore and boo on them for pulling this from theaters but this is a step in the right direction you quite literally cant make this movie 10 years ago generational spectacle its the first of a whole but it feels still like a complete journey its one of those rare experiences you cant miss on the big screen  like if you have any love of film at all you must see it at least once in a premium format i think its going to be canon one day  its the shining example of villeneuves talent and what makes him the most interesting director working i mean this seriously  some moments in this rival the same awe i felt the first time i watched 2001 in a theater imax  you just get those goosebumps and feelings of disbelief at what youre watching i still dont know how they pulled some of this off  ill be honest i got a little emotional watching some of this again in such a grand way not just for what we missed during the lost year in theaters but just in appreciating what the best of what the spectacle of moviegoing can give you a movie the bulk of this is very squarely fixed in a bush america and some of the commentary lacks the kind of nuance that weve learned about global politics since it came out i think some of it is the same kind of issue blazing saddles faces now  timely subversion that now looks dated without viral context  but some of it is just parkerstones sense of humor just not advancing past what was allowed at the time some of it is aggressively funny some of it is just not quite there anymore whats surprising is some of its best material isnt even humor  its the darkness that seeps in with the characters and the story the music is solid the puppetry is deeply impressive the puking scene is still the funniest part besides the house cats i really wish there was more here that aged well but its still quite good for what its trying to do its not my favorite thing parkerstone have done but its important for what it accomplished even if what some of it accomplished shows a little naivety and insensitivity as much as the absence of john r dilworth looms over this its very weird he virtually had nothing to do with the revival of courage and didnt sign off on this this is leagues better than the cgi scoob movie that committed the unforgivable sin of recasting shaggy matthew lillard is the only person that should be allowed to play or voice shaggy until his passing this should be us law the tonal clash of courages artsycreepy horror comedy and scooby doos kooky 60s mystery caper isnt nearly as jarring as youd expect no dilworth means the graceful terror of the original courage series is missing but the body horror comedy and abstractions and all the usual beats for courage are present the original show is landmark for animation and one of the best animated series of all time this revival is pretty darn enjoyable in a good fan fiction sort of way thea whites muriel being back and is just as good as ever just before her passing hits hard i forgot what a spectacular piece of voice acting that was and what a great tender character she is she and courages dynamic still hits home so sweet some of this is a little too goofy for its own good eustaces rap number is a choice but its so much better than it has any right to be and just so so much better than the bigbudget animated film meant to spark a cinematic universe it gets both series right and it has lillard right where he needs to be also what a randomly hilariousmoving statement on the relationship the anxious have with calming apps the likely first and last courage family reunion was a nice little thing i didnt know i needed mixing in scoobydoo is a clever little wrinkle that makes this directtodvd ditty worth the time the best and worst of kevin smith rolled up into a delicious burger that gives you the runs as i get uncomfortably closer to 30 i cant help but feel much more so now the burden of time than i did when i snuckwatched this in 2006 that smith places on dante and randal selling burgers and talking pop culture into their 30s as life passes them by and they start to grapple with the fact that theyre not really young anymore you can tell that smith is at war with himself as a creator here still slinging the same shockdisgust humor but wholly unable to fumble the emotional beats that define his best films he cant let go of some truly uncomfortable jokes by todays standard half of randals shtick would get tossed out in millisecond in todays climate for obvious reason which makes some of this movie age like an old hamburger on the sidewalk its not really fair to judge everything on that standard with smith more than willing to answer for randals defeating immaturity with deepseeded insecurity and fear for how small he feels in a world that seems to be passing him by and a past he probably never fully appreciated until it was long gone they say youth is wasted on the young and its clear smith is asking himself and his popculture obsessed audience if they really understand how precious the days of empty chatter with beloved buddies are how the time you spend with those you love and the good you can rummage up to do for others really cements your time on this planet not the big dreams you muster or the life goals you feel bound to complete dante and randal may feel lost in the dog days of the service industry but its that theyre together that makes it worthwhile and even joyous and well worth the menial nature though smiths irony comes with finding that out before so much of it is off the clock you cant always appreciate what youve got while youve got it in abundance which is why life can be so bittersweet smiths penchant for vulgarity and shock value never served him quite like he hoped this of course came before his spat with rotten tomatoes and cop outyoga hosers period when you could tell he was struggling to find his voice as an artist who saw an industry starting to pass him by and a style that was growing more dated by the hour jay and silent bob reboot was actually a pretty nice little comeback vehicle for him and clearly clerks iii might be his best chance in decades to make a sincerely good movie informed by reallife struggle dante and randal have always been his most honest characters and best evolving reflections of self as you can tell randals teary lament to dante in jail is fully smith purging his own insecurities about aging onto the page making randal have a heart attack to directly mimic his own experience really has some dramatic potential that rivals anything hes done in his career it might be the best proving ground hes ever had though you just hope the juvenile sensibilities strike more toward character than offensiveness i get some of randals grossout lowbrow creepy gags are of their time and made to reflect a shallow immature likely dishonest goober who talks a big game and doesnt have much to back up with but his persona is caught between genuine empathy and a damning sense of obsoleteness people complain you cant make this anymore with certain comedies but clearly some of this movies humor is irresponsible and embarrassing thankfully smith has beyond evolved his rhetoric his latest view askew film finds a much more palatable sensibility but youve got to weigh this films good heart smart wordplay and deeply touching character work and performance with its at times bewildering lack of awareness though thats smith for you circles 2006 jeff andersons performance beyond being really nuanced and powerful at its best moments also captures a sense of lowliness and timidity that does make this films most faceplanting moments feel less proud and more selfcritical than smiths page does this is a very good film in spurts and a bizarre rusted time capsule in other ways itll rightfully stay in its time of release and probably will get revisited with some negative attention once the new film comes out for how cringey some of the humor is but also dont forget the beating heart of it all that helps contextualize some of this films lesser angels as sad consequences of living life without full awareness of how precious it is and how wonderful it is to have those around you a glorious overexaggeration jan de bont knew how to give folks a good time at the movies for the goofy moments and aged vfx theres a real sense of terror with the storm and a real sense of excitement for the chase its a great cast bill paxton such a loveable jackass in this and helen hunt does a great job as the anchor for the emotion psh obvs is the mvp though the worlds best stormchasing hype man this is a little long and ridiculous but its also just a tourdeforce roller coaster theme park attraction which is ironic because the actual theme park attraction for this sucked look the russos were a weird ass pick to direct this movie being that the last nonmcu film they made was you me and dupree cherry is a lot of things and at times the russos completely whiff on what theyre trying to say only to be bailed out by their really impressive cast the russos know how to cast well thats the only reason this film at least to me holds itself together its a glossy goodfellas of an addicts descent free of any nuance the russos are not the guys who will give you that but tom holland is a supremely gifted young guy who understands the story much better than the russos do and hes pretty dang good here hes better at capturing the dangers of  boredom and economic disruption better at casting a side eye to the empty dangerous machismo of his military training better at portraying the devastation of ptsd and the inability to find meaningful help for it better at sliding into addiction and eventual ruin the russos dont know how to do any of that convincingly but their filmmaking still somehow refracts back with oomph because they were smart enough to wrangle in holland and ciara bravo who does some underappreciated heavy lifting her the russos are not probably going to make another movie like cherry with some of these reactions devastatingly negative but i found some engagement in this thing its no better or worse at fast food imitation of a better filmmaker than its peers i think theyre doing more refn than scorsese and its again anchored by an actor in a better movie holland is genuinely good here and that military section is genuinely interesting and thoughtful in its brazenness to depict the downsides of army life in such a crass empty way its unafraid to have a more blunt conversion about the 00s wars than some other things ive seen and i liked that about it the addiction drama is grimy and shallow but holland bravo jack reynor and forrest goodluck are so dang good in portraying the darkness and immorality of the moment that it becomes surprisingly watchable i dont think the russos are doing bad work here but i question what happens if the cast falls through its a decent flick but holland earns his stripes a voracious twisted vision of hell a carnival of sin and discord forged in the bowels of something unholy and wretched gaspar noe by means of lars von trier with john waters david lynch harmony korine nicolas winding refn bobcat goldthwait rob zombie darren aronofsky uwe boll the farrellys and tim story serving as creative consultants a disturbing survey of a languishing grave of holiday capitalism screeching from the beyond warnings of greed and excess a demented ballet of gruesome revenge from an ugly amoral soul i feel i am drawn to this film for its pungent nostalgia for the feelings i have when i watch it that cannot be explained for the quality of what im watching but i also defend the filmmaking this is what happens when a film goes so off the rails that it dips into a twilight zone where so many delirious accidents and haphazard creative choices get hocked together into something so unsettling garish crass dated individual there will never be another movie like ron howards the grinch and 2003s cat in the hat these are abominations but also such fascinating time capsules and signifiers for what the universal studios corporate suite thought was cinematically appropriate for the work of dr seuss in a world of mcus and sterile family entertainment i crave something so disastrously captivating as ron howards the grinch its wrong to like this movie but like it i do for all of its festering warts and licked toads its legitimately entertaining in a very selfish way  i find no inherent value in what im watching but i still take great pride in finding value in the experience i think this film works in some ways because there are some genuinely great things about it on purpose and on accident jim carrey is a man possessed  it is the most physical performance of all time and im dumbfounded and deeply fascinated that he did this me myself and irene and man on the moon so close together its like he did the majestic as a way to come off the acid trip he mustve had to go on to be in those consecutive movies i dont like to think he ever took the grinch makeup off  he just stayed in there pushing the brink of his mental stability until he was just grinch nothing less nothing more just grinch its an astounding feat of physical comedy and excess emoting its a miracle he was able to do this and make it so lasting  i mean that rick baker and companys makeup is unbelievable for how it just meshes into the characters the dog is a good actor dog taylor momson is a good kid actor tambor plays smug like a fiddle clint howard is the perfect actor for such a besmirched production getting faith hill to sing the main song over the credits after this nearly twohour psychedelic breakdown is absolutely hilarious this movie should not exist but im so glad it does its a wonderful example of some of the deeply strange stuff that masqueraded as family entertainment when i was a kid im all the better and worst for it i find value in this film its a weird unkempt relentlessly crudeyetdisarminglywarm piece of early 2000s kitsch but its also one of the most popular and rewatched christmas films of all time only a holiday movie could be so bizarre and still garner such adoration and loyalty a cheap sizzle reel of hero worship and political mythmaking telling in its utter inability to find anything particularly laudable about rudy giuliani in flashbacks of his spotty career in public service as a draconian attorneyturnedmayor any virtue bestowed upon him is in imagined dialogue where any of his actions are heralded as the right thing to do because hes rudy a good american and new yorker who loves his city its telling giuliani made a cameo in this to give it his official seal of approval  its mostly the biopic equivalent of blowing smoke up the buttocks i really dont know what to do with the 911 material here its obviously the pivotal part of giulianis public persona what he was mainly known for pretrump giulianis actual response and legacy to that horrible day is much more complicated now than it was when this film was made already coronated as americas mayor a shine that largely followed him nationally up to his time in this current administration its a little shameless to have footage used like this pandering in a way to serve mainly the purpose of telling giulianis story its his movie but this films handling of 911 feels very lacking but it was also released in 2003 before anyone really saw the full picture i dont know james woods performance is kind of just what he used to do in movies banter quickly and yell loudly its a strange balance of wanting to portray giuliani as this moral fortress who also casually cheats on his wife shows no mercy in his law uses the southern strategy to win an election and berates superiors as a showing of strength hes given a glowing aura the story cant organically fulfill on subtle purpose or accident it just shows him as a brash ineffective law and order politician who gets thrust into history and is hailed in the moment for saying all the right things and being at the front and center its not to say he didnt do good things around 911 its just that hes not nearly the unifying hero that this movie tried to make him out to be clearly this film has no cultural currency outside of that twitter clip that went viral not very indicative of the rest of the film which is as a whole listless uneventful and kind of boring but it is a fascinating time capsule to see how reputations get built off of fictional work he was americas mayor because thats what folks were told he was its how trump was seen as a successful businessman who could stabilize the economy stories matter mythmaking in politics is dangerous this film is definitely guilty of this its whatever a madefortv procedural biopic that cant really rectify its desire to glorify its subject with a lifes story unable to provide many examples of why that glorification is wholly deserved i really wonder what the good people at toho thought when they left the screening room after being shown roland emmerichs take on the beloved godzilla its probably like what walt disney would think if those people who make cheap animated films with rob schneider for redbox made a mickey mouse movie godzilla 98 is a thing to behold a doofy creature feature where quite literally everyone is an idiot and common sense and basic physics are thrown to the wind in exchange for lots of explosions and loud roaring the godzilla roar is one of the most jolting noises in global cinema and here its sounded so much all at once you lose sight of it and just get lost in the cacophonous nonsense i cant deny emmerich mustve had the time of his life here because this is a silly movie with a true sense of personality it has no idea its so crazy and lazily written and it marches around like its the second coming of jurassic park jan de bont was originally supposed to make this and i wouldve been so curious to see what that wouldve been like he showed so much clever restraint on speed and emmerich never met a restraint he didnt want to break with 30 tons of explosives hes basically who he is as a filmmaker a much less problematic hokier michael bay who has destroyed the world like 5 times respect is due to how unfailingly sincere he is even if his films have never been particularly great godzilla 98 is a big uninspired contrived mess but you have to at least somewhat enjoy how happygolucky it is like they basically took a big dump on the godzilla mythos and reduced him to a lifeless cgi horror of a dinosaur and i still didnt hate this stupid movie because of how eager it is i really really hated how they lost godzilla so much no one in new york could not keep their tabs on a gigantic monster multiple scenes have everyone asking wheres godzilla like its homer simpson trying to pitch poochie to the springfield tv execs hes right there youll yell at the screen hes right there godzilla is right behind you how did he go from rampaging in the streets to hiding in the sewer system why does the mayor in this get so mad about evacuating the city after a gigantic dinosaur attacks why did this film cast harry shearer to play the news anchor when he also voices kent brockman on the simpsons making a phrase like the disney store has been looted less of a forbidding sign of the times in this movie and more like an episode of the simpsons why was hank azarias character composite for animal the cameraman a slice of new york pepperoni pizza brought to life by a wizard why did they try to lure godzilla by putting down a big pile of fish in the middle of new york city why is the military so stupid in this even by the standards of movie military people is that really godzilla or just a giant stupid lizard who apparently has the ability to lay hundreds of eggs in the span of like an hour much less why was a renowned nuclear physicist taking a picture of godzilla with a disposable camera multiple times why didnt i absolutely hate this movie i think it was because of the french military subplot i did enjoy that jean reno is always great this is ok gleefully dull but with enough earnest panache and spirit that you cant dismiss it outright there is a great moment where matthew broderick a casting decision i actually didnt hate tried to escape on an elevator at madison square garden from a bunch of hungry baby godzillas barely getting the door to close to save his hide he gets to another floor and the door opens he sees a bunch of other baby godzillas chowing down on a popcorn machine they look at him he says wrong floor and closes the door i laughed this was a heck of a bit why couldnt the whole movie just be that godzilla as an ip is fine now this is ironically kind of like the 2001 planet of the apes film i just watched in 2020 this one is probably more remembered since it was such a big thing but theyre both bigbudget onestop pop culture moments that flamed out because no one really liked them this was also far too long but i dont think that really matters at a point liked those practical sets though love those practical sets what a fun nasty little movie tim burton got the raw end of the deal that this wasnt a bigger thing its got such an anarchistic spirit its laughourloud funny its insanely creative the multinarrative layout works well and the aliens are so fun its a better movie than independence day and i wish we talked about this every 4th of july instead of independence day its such a wonderful lampoon of the establishment and hammers in burtons disdain for those in charge its also got the frenetic spirit of a pg13 tex averychuck jonesbob clampett cartoon the dove gag and ensuing no birds sign and the aliens general disdain for birds in general made be howl this movie is a heck of a comedy on top of its delightful parody of scifi tropes im most struck by this rewatch because the animation is starting to really date itself this movie is almost 20 years old that astounds me i was like 8 when it came out and i remember being so enthralled with how weird and funny it was i was laughing so much as a kid in this that i purposefully wet my pants so i could avoid going to the bathroom and miss any of the movie i was that hooked i peed myself in honor of shrek it holds up because its one of those movies that always will its just hard to make an animated movie with this much staying power one that even if some of the animation is looking a little rusty these days still crackles with so much wit and has such a large heart jokes i still laugh very loudly at the duloc welcome song and the exploding song bird the brimstone exchange most all of donkeys lines probably more the welcome song was one of the funniest things id ever seen when i was 8 the timing of that is unreal everything about shrek is good its all at once such an oddball movie and a towering achievement in animation i think one fuels the other hot take shrek is a great movie id kind of seen rumblings about people revisiting this and being kind of awestruck by it and i can happily say i am now in the number that says the 2001 josie and the pussycats movie is fantastic i watched this on hbomax at my fiancées now wife house and when she saw what i had watched she texted me and said did you really watch josie and the pussycats she is a very understanding person i mean yowza where the heck did this come from where was its audience when it came out why am i just now watching this its great its basically using a nostalgic ip as a trojan horse for scathing hilarious satire on the blind consumerism of the late 90searly 00s where people just bought stuff without really thinking hmm why am i buying this is this good is it good for me i feel like weve all become more mindful of being advertised to and about the products we buy but a movie like this still makes you kind of look around and see that we are still a world dominated by brands its that now brands have to play fair er maybe just more fair than they used to consumerism being a means for conformity and a suppression of individual ideas championed by those who are trying to compensate for how their individualism backfired on them is not a theme i expected in the 2001 josie and the pussycats movie i really couldnt have told you a year ago id be singing this films praises mainly because a year ago i had forgotten this movie existed its great unlike a lot of the teendriven movies of its time this one is incredibly smart and has some serious panache to the style it mimics the boy band music video template in its aesthetic which ages more like a wise stylistic decision to date the material rather than a point of convenience in the filmmaking process the entire cast is excellent i mean this in no point of irony tara reid is oscarworthy in this film like on the same level as melissa mccarthy in bridesmaids as are the script songs and maybe even parker posey and alan cummings the satire hits in waves i cannot understate how biting some of it is particularly the way it brazenly skewers the music business and its treatment of the art artists and audience the humor is belly laugh worthy the du jour 20002001 graphic got me right in the kisser the writing and direction are creative and assured and the music is legitimately great du jour in and of itself is such a brilliant sendup of the boy band every single note of satire is just great here the world might be different than when this was made but my goodness this is such a clever endearing madcap film its genius how they pull this off and so sad that few people really grappled with how great it is when it was released its one of the best cult films ive ever seen and one of the flatout best satires period watch this its on hbo max at the time and its legitimately superb we cant go to movie theaters right now but my goodness you can sure plop on the couch and watch the wonderful 2001 josie and the pussycats movie one of the best things ive seen in awhile when i was a kid i didnt watch this a ton after i saw it in theaters primarily because this was the dark disney movie i dont think anyone in my family was keen on revisiting i get why its an inescapably human decidedly nondisney work a gorgeous philosophical rumination on religion moral hypocrisy the infallible nature of man the power of kindness in a world that so often forgoes it genocide repressed human emotion fermented into pious villainy the war within the church for servant love versus moral rule inner beauty societal oppression etc its not a movie 4yearold cory really got im sure and its precisely why though they detract from the films swelling power at times the gargoyles are necessary kids needed yknow something to hold on to and wisecracking rock things do the trick but adult cory loves seeing something like the hellfire music number in a disney movie this is the darkest g movie of all time its like the bambis mom scene for 90 minutes knowing deep down this isnt even quasimodos story and though its thrilling and unforgettable to see him swing through the corridors of notre dame singing about going outside his shelled home its frollos story the real hunchback of notre dame a grotesque man whose devious moral crusades mask his inability to rectify with his own shortcomings and fear of not being good enough for his false sense of righteousness its a disturbingly relevant character and tony jay voices the hell out of him musical numbers like topsy turvy and hellfire just arent things disney does or ever did this film came out during a major transition for disney and it feels like this film slipped through the cracks a happy accident if you will i dont want a watered down liveaction version of this i want the most pg13 g movie of all time to stay how it is if you just kind of let the gargoyle stuff be the jason alexanders gargoyle is attracted to a goat material is almost funny in a really embarrassing way this film is the best thing the studio put out in the 90s that wasnt beauty and the beast aladdin or lion king heck some of the highs here are as good as those movies maybe better in some regards this is a hallmark in taking a basic story trope the boy and his dog and driving in a wholly original delightfully irreverent vision with it at its base i really appreciate that disney didnt seem to hold this one back much the studios output was at a point in the early 00s that in a posttarzan world they were making more nonmusical risks it eventually cratered and they had to return to the songandascene format of the 80s90s renaissance princess and the frogtangled really starting in the second renaissance so some not good movies like home on the range and chicken little slipped through but so did outstanding films like lilo and stitch and treasure planet the voice cast here is just to die for daviegh chase doing this and spirited away in the same year is unbelievable and the animation is gorgeous sanders and deblois really let the backdrops take a dust into hawaiian watercolor feel and when a film this nutty and sweet also have a rigorous artistic backbone these guys also know how to plot story like crazy so you know the pace emotional beats elite and narrative payoff will be there i wish disney didnt beat the heck out of this with that bgrade television show and all the directtovideo sequels because this films legacy deserves the gold standard its one of disneys best animated films and one of its most proudly original its also got the emotional sophistication you expect from the studios best works its the ateam the surfing hawaiian roller coaster ride sequence is earned not bought when a film can pull something like that off so effortlessly to where its not like hey look a great idea thats when you know
Feb 5 2022,negative,it is not just a bad movie it is depressingly bad in large part for what it says about the prevailing atmosphere of utter contempt for the art  and the audience  in which movies now are designed and produced

Jul 23 2020,negative,the overall effect is about as scary as an outofcontrol street parade float
Feb 26 2020,negative,hollywoods godzilla was devoid of personality we didnt care what happened to that megalizard heck we didnt even get a good look at him until three quarters of the way through the film
Apr 11 2018,negative, this time godzilla is really dead a child of atomic blasts it survived attacks by every conventional and fanciful weapon industrialized nations could throw at it jets bombs gunships rockets tanksthe whole toy chest once it was enclosed in a bubble and kidnapped to outer space recruited to do another planets dirty work its been attacked by flying saucers the super x2 experimental craft an oversized king kong electrified pylons biollante the biological weapon suspiciously penilelooking poisonspitting mothra larvae its been plotted against implement plan 2 item 4 schedule 5 by alien kilaaks and the republic of saradia discussed by the mental science exploitation center and world space authority mesmerized by teenybopper psychokinesis it ate nuclear power plants enjoyed those thank you it beat rodan mechagodzilla and hydraheaded king ghidera or monster zero when controlled from the hidden fortress within mount fuji by aliens from planet x in the scorpion system that paralyzing titanium ray in the back just when it was about to slam down titanosaurus well lets just say that only made godzillas victory dance that much sweeter but in godzilla vs das spielbergle the beast finally meets its match director roland the spielbergy emmerich his nicknames mistranslation from his native germansurely they mean spielburglarmight simply indicate that germans dont get spielberg any better than most american critics lobotomized godzillas walnutsized brain removed its mind in extravagant digital cosmetic surgery leaving poor pop toho destitute of reasons to ever make another inexpensive innocent adolescent mechanicalminiature adventure with ugly old analog godzilla the dead weight of godzilla has permanently imbalanced the series economy of scale they show extreme intelligence even problem solving intelligence  especially the big one says the kenyan game warden robert muldoon of jurassic parks raptors that one when she looks at you you can see that shes working things out well when modzilla looks at you you can see it hasnt a clue this godzillas had his personality digitized to death a poor example of character animation lacking any discernible character unlike the jurassic dinosaurs which das spielbergle simply copied in larger scale godzilla exhibits no creepy recognizable realistic animal behavior either its figuration lacks a memorable primal snapshot its posed a lot like the evil one from spawn and even then its only glimpsed quickly the first rogue of the furtive monsters of filmland the toho effects artists werent hiding anything they beheld godzillas enthralling visage with lingering terrorandgiggleinducing portraits if not for the taco bell collectors cups and dreyers ice cream cartons youd scarcely remember this godzilla much less conjure it in a nightmare its even a dull colorhey  its greyzilla its blahzillanot your toxic mountain dew green seen as an atomomutated iguana it has an overdeveloped lower jaw and a cruel face like a giant alien and mostly its glimpsed in body parts when a filmmaker settles on these newfangled effects he doesnt want the audience looking too long at them besides were in new york and the meters running the decision to make godzilla an expensive effects film immediately departs from the series aesthetic and iconographic tradition which even resisted stopmotion as in the beast from 20000 fathoms or the effect tim burton captured so marvelously using computergenerated imagery in mars attacks the onslaught of exploitative digital effects effectively removes godzilla from the world of juvenile pleasurenow it would need a gargantuan audienceleaving nothing of interest for any age its not a good adult movie its not a good kids movie its not a good movie its not a movie its an event godzilla overdone in this manner by a junkmeister proves that movies are improving in ways that dont matter and getting worse in ways that do and how quickly did the promise of cgis limitless possibilities run into the productized deceit of the banal despite the spielberg mimicry the fishermen on the wharf i think we need bigger gunsyes we know the drama hasnt the snap of jaws while spielbergs works toward transforming and perfecting genre emmerich hasnt yet achieved tongueincheek and the effects show no improvement over the now fiveyearold jurassic park such as in the swish pan to successively snapping baby godzillas in madison square garden which copies not quotes the raptors in the kitchen scene and weve seen godzillas dopey son minya before he grew up to become barney as compared to the effects achieved in the contemporary production lost worldwith its safari romp breathtaking cliffhanger sequence a master class in directing that would have had hitchcock furiously taking notes and raptors attacking at dynamic obliques seen overhead as they cut swaths across the tall grass toward their preywell thats on another filmmaking planet interested observers of the recent sins that have been visited upon all thats been held sacred about the cinema couldnt resist heaping upon the coming of godzilla an unintended weight godzilla would not just symbolize as it always has mans imbalance with nature in the atomic age godzillas reference to french nuclear testing speaks from tradition but it would rather represent everything thats gone wrong with the movies as the soulless unstoppable hyperbole machine emerged from the roiling water and headed toward a neighborhood near you the monstrous event would not be indeed could not be about a movie with any meaning a reading from the prophetess pauline kaels why are movies so bad or the numbers predicts these apocalyptic events she foresaw such überscaled product as coming from dispassionate now unfettered directors like emmerich a local demigod merely because his movies stargate and independence daythe cynically dumbeddown obvious humorless clunkily scripted and unimaginative packets of stolen bits from better filmsmade money after the noahs ark principle joey aka making contact hollywoodmonster aka ghost chase moon 44 aka intruder and universal soldier no one was declaring his genius or even his undiscovered aptitudethe numbers in a nutshell godzillas riskless capitalization on a famous product trademark would promise expensive visual effects and thus create the kind of synergy between entertainment media the 100 million in marketing buys lots of synergy and line up tv and newspaper shills like professional advance men finally since the audience for dogpatch poesy completes the prosaic act the simple art of the genre film becomes defined downward for an audience so numb desperate and raddled that all they want are noisy thrills and dumb jokes and images that move along in an undemanding way so they can sit and react at the simplest motor levelprophetess pauline reviewing godzilla miraculously accurately in 1980 tristar claims it begged the dean devlinroland emmerich team four times before they agreed to make godzilla the numbers mean a studio wouldnt even consider interesting japanese directors such as shasuke kaneko who made gamera 2 assault of the legion as recently as 1996 or kazuki ohmori godzilla vs biollante shows updated technique without corruption of character or godzilla 1985s koji hashimoto or an american respectful of adolescent imagination such as joe dante give those guys 100 million and see what they come up with madeinjapan pop cant even get distributed here carefully debarked of anything objectionable or stimulating godzilla turns out to be far too pointedly pointless to get agitated about it doesnt even destroy structures in new york that might resonatethe citicorp building headquarters of the planets most evil bank by the way the world trade center towers the limelight disco or st patricks cathedral the idea is to crush all meaning without mercy even as a study in scale the effects are uninspiring they lack the transfixing power of the giganticized george michaels or rolling stones music videos even the crude rear screen of the miner who discovers rodans nest whats more the juvenile pleasure of godzilla was suspension of suspension of disbelief drifting between seeing godzilla as a believable beast andor a japanese man in the godzilla suit destroying the neatest miniature city not a photorealistic place but a spectacular diorama it was attacked by your toy tanks and planes indeed the godzilla action figures of the sixties were godzillathe movie character was not more realistic it only moved did no one have the sense to ask emmerich at least rhetorically why would you want to make a realistic godzilla emmerich shows no sympathy for the devil tohos godzilla was never studiosterile godzilla mogul tomoyuki tanakas enterprise was stylized japanese pop art for kids replete with harmoniously singing twinpixie girls mod fashion comicbook art direction and mythic beasts in a pyrotechnic puppettheater the head forbade godzilla to tromp right by the tokyo skyscrapers and crush that delicate precious defenseless old pagoda the heart secretly pounded applause to godzillas every destructive tantrum the real famous original godzilla toho should now make this distinction like rays pizza parlors has the face of a hoppingmad wet feline atop a long stiff neck a house cat after a bath with a flattened brow ridge cum fastback an oddly likeable smirk and irradiated dorsal fins splayed in a lovely rhythm down his spine that strangely innocent and tragic monster as memorably described by series veteran raymond burr in godzilla 1985 was essentially a pro wrestler as likely to be cast as hero with a sentimentalized departure as a villain to vanquish even still a misty moment or topple over ending the movie immediately sometimes seconds later that wrestling dynamicthe movies were even promoted as big fightsmeant it had simple dramatic coherency too the reconfiguration of popular theater roland barthes critiques lovingly even saddled with an inexpressive kabuki mask face godzilla can gloat it just needs body language to do that arms outstretched in that protorocky pose it tosses a huge bolder with a giant lobster monster back and forth until godzilla gets bored and breaks off a claw its bawl is perfectly strange and horribly funnyan elephant shriek quickly descending into an ursineleonine roar now its a cataleptic sony dynamic digital sound blast only at selected theaters good old godzilla hops into karate kicks does a japanese jig and thumps its overdeveloped chest with undersized arms it judothrows creatures to cheesy hammond b3 organled jazz riffs its heroism interrupted by a death ray from a ufo hovering above godzilla grabs his throat with one hand and gestures with the other looks up plaintively as if stricken with laryngitis and shakes his head as if to apologize to all the worlds children im in the grip of a death ray what can i do where is emmerichs contribution to godzillas legend his reductive method is the least holistic gestalt of alevel directors in hollywood he plucks from action films setups and shots and bits but then he combines them dispassionately artlessly mechanically without any added sensibility by their first few minutes his films feel old in universal soldier 92 he starts in the seagalstalloneschwarzenegger mode of mayhem then settles into robocop minus verhoevens uncomprehended neosirkian euroirony terminator 2 the unflinchingly selfcauterizing mute brute protecting the tough yet emotional broad with a touch of the good soldierbad soldier dynamic of platoon the emotion is so calculated it feels as if emmerichs punched through the chest and ripped out the bloody halfhour heart of character development his notion of artistic progress is stealing from better movies stargate close encounters and timecop independence day close encounters and star wars godzilla jurassic park jaws and aliens theres rarely reference to anything that wasnt hugely successful because reiteration of successful formula is all emmerichs about this is hitmaking by the numbers boxoffice 1s and who can blame him godzilla made 74 million its first hollywood fiveday weekendprobably more than all previous godzilla pictures combinedto mediamuttering of industry disappointment the sole purpose of this product was to make more money than anything else before it generate a reflexive response immune to critical and public opinion then let it creep back to the mediocresea but who grieves for godzilla this time godzilla wont be back but the creature the germans call das spielbergle youll never stop this guy mr inoshiro honda who directed most of the toho godzilla exhibited oldfashioned showmanship if emmerich had any passion for the franchise hed have revised hondas famous freezeframe credit sequence sneak previews which in the sixties served the triple purpose of evoking gales of shrieking laughter and shouting thats a sound one never hears anymoremovies today cant even work kids up into a frenzy serving up instant gratification that made it easier to then settle in for plot and giving flustered mothers the chance to scurry up the aisles with shocked bawling infants a black mark of our film culture this godzilla only excited furiously marketing and synergyproducing adults
Dec 11 2014,negative, the classic japanese monster film has been updated by the team that produced and directed stargate and independence day and what we get is basically jurassic park with one very very big dinosaur nuclear testing has resulted in the mutation of a fishloving lizard who seeks out manhattan as an ideal place for him to lay eggs he is a self reproducing hemaphrodite godzilla roars around knocking down buildings bespectacled scientist nick tatapolous matthew broderick works with the us army and a mysterious group of frenchmen to try to stop him and audrey maria petillo the girl who broke nicks heart in college tries to break into the broadcast reporting big leagues by getting the inside story on the scariness scale this one fits in at around the jurassic park level with a few jumpoutatyou surprises and some tense moments the special effects are stateofthe art but not particularly innovative there are some striking visuals and a few clever plot turns but the movie sorely misses the quirky charm of independence days will smith and jeff goldblum and the story never captures the heart as far as i am concerned the real special effect in this movie is the way they managed to make it appear that manhattan was evacuated almost instantaneously parents should know that younger kids aware of indias recent nuclear testing may be concerned that real mutations could be occuring some kids may be confused because at times godzilla is presented sympathetically especially as heshe shows protective fury in finding her babies have been killed parents of older kids may want to talk with them about why it was important to phillippe jean reno to take responsibility for godzilla and why it was wrong for audrey to betray nicks trust
Dec 5 2014,negative,save your seven bucks and visit the big apples other green giant lady liberty
May 6 2014,negative, the independence day team of writerdirector roland emmerich and writerproducer dean devlin update the japanese monster series with dubious results the pictures fatal flaw is its inability to give us any consistent sense of godzillas size one minute the creature is knocking down skyscrapers with a swish of its tale and the next its hiding between buildings from the us army the action mostly takes place in new york city even more ridiculous is godzillas habit of burrowing into subway tunnels to escape and if you hoped for a little personality in your monster forget about it godzilla is as bland as the humans scurrying at its feet which include matthew broderick hank azaria jean reno and maria pitillo
Mar 14 2013,negative,its just another humdrum monster movie with godzilla stapled on the marketing for the name recognition
Feb 11 2012,neutral,when the lead actor and monster give you pause well you also start noticing other things that youd overlook in better thrillrides like independence day
Sep 7 2011,neutral,despite some clever and exciting sequences though this 120 million epic of reconstituted atomic age trash lumbers more than it thrills
Dec 24 2010,negative,there are some striking visuals and a few clever plot turns but the movie sorely misses the quirky charm of independence days will smith and jeff goldblum and the story never captures the heart 
Jan 7 2009,negative,its a horrendously long poorly acted unoriginal piece of crap that made me sad to be a japaneseamerican
Nov 27 2008,negative,  no doubt about it godzilla will be a killer at the box office during the early stages of its prodigiously wide release the slambang excitement and stateoftheart special effects are more than impressive but even with all that going for it godzilla isnt likely to post titanicsize grosses no doubt about it godzilla will be a killer at the box office during the early stages of its prodigiously wide release the slambang excitement and stateoftheart special effects are more than impressive enough to ensure every 12yearold boy in the known universe will want to see it early and often and millions of nostalgic babyboomers will be drawn by the novelty of a new and improved version of the lizard who repeatedly razed tokyo in bmovies of yesteryear but even with all that going for it godzilla isnt likely to post titanicsize grosses or even challenge the records set by independence day the last highconcept scifi spectacle devised by director roland emmerich and producer dean devlin despite all the flash and filigree this monster movie is curiously  and conspicuously  lacking in heart godzilla is not so much a remake as a reinvention of the 1954 japanese production that spawned scores of sequels comic books and television commercials us audiences are more familiar with the first pics 1956 americanized version  godzilla king of the monsters  which incorporated new footage with raymond burr as a reporternarrator in the emmerichdevlin version as in the original the title creature is an unforeseen side effect of nuclear testing the big difference is this godzilla is not a regenerated dinosaur rather fallout from french nuclear blasts in the south pacific have turned a lizard into a gigantic mutant monster only tantalizing bits and pieces of the monster are glimpsed during the early portions of the pic as screenwriters devlin and emmerich working from a story they concocted with ted elliott and terry rossio zip through exposition and introduce lead characters after an effectively frightening godzilla attack on a japanese fishing ship focus shifts to the ukraine where dr niko tatopoulos matthew broderick a biologist from the us nuclear regulatory commission is studying the effect of radiation leakage on earthworms near chernobyl a military team led by colonel hicks kevin dunn drops in to whisk tatopoulos away to help with a much bigger problem joined by paleontologists elsie chapman vicki lewis and mendel craven malcolm danare tatopoulos and the military team examine among other things the beached wreckage of the japanese vessel the ship has a huge claw mark on its bow but thats not the worst of it tatopoulos finds traces of blood that along with the creatures footprints point to the existence of some sort of enormous reptile right from the start broderick conveys a geewhiz ingenuousness that is distracting at best insipid at worst brodericks mannered affectations are either meant to humanize a thinly written character or simply provide comic relief either way the performance as a whole comes off as a major miscalculation to the point of making one miss the morose gravity of burr in the earlier godzilla in sharp contrast jean reno takes a winningly subtle approach in offering a crafty mix of foreboding and bemusement as philippe roache a french secret agent whos working undercover as an insurance company representative he too observes the wreckage and also interviews the only crew member who survives the attack on the ship during that interview the traumatized survivor refers to the creature as a legendary sea serpent gojira eventually of course this name is bastardized into godzilla meanwhile off the east coast of the united states fishing boats have their own close encounter with the lizard by the time tatopoulos and company get to manhattan the creature is ready to make his american debut at the fulton fish market from there he rambles over to wreak havoc in the citys financial district just in time to interrupt a reelection campaign speech by the excitable mayor ebert michael lerner audrey timmonds maria pitillo an ambitious researcher for egotistical tv news anchor charles caiman harry shearer sees the godzilla invasion as her big chance for professional advancement since she just happens to be the former girlfriend of tatopoulos shes able to coax the stillsmitten scientist into revealing more than he should about the creature throughout godzilla new york endures the most sustained rainfall in all of movie history most of the action takes place at night but even the daytime scenes unfold under darkly overcast skies which of course makes it all the easier for emmerich to obscure godzillas features for the maximum amount of time to generate the maximum amount of suspense but when the creature is fully visible it resembles nothing more than a hybrid of the mother beast from alien and a trex from jurassic park although the effect is striking its not the familiar creature who often managed to earn audience sympathy or at least develop a distinct personality theres something oddly genericlooking about this computergenerated image this slimmeddown turbocharged beast is able to move easier and lunge more quickly while dashing through the streets of manhattan but then again why should godzilla have to dash part of what made the original godzilla and its sequels so much fun was godzillas badass takenoguff attitude as he lumbered down streets kicking over buildings and remaining defiantly immune to bullets bombs and heatseeking missiles this godzilla usually runs away from his attackers causing most of his damage mostly by accident and wheres the fire in all of godzilla the gangsta lizard breathes flame only twice hardly enough to satisfy anyone familiar with the godzilla mythos godzilla features some serviceable monster mayhem on new york streets and offers a nifty assault in central park but the movie doesnt really kick into high gear until tatopoulos and roache along with roaches heavily armed french compatriots make their way into the evacuated city after godzillas apparent demise they discover godzilla has laid about 200 readytohatch eggs in the bowels of madison square garden theres no getting around the fact that all the godzilla offspring bear a suspicious resemblance to the jurassic park raptors just as in that lizard epic the good guys  joined by tv cameraman victor animal palotti hank azaria  race down hallways and crouch behind closed doors pursued by the hungry creatures and the thrills and spills appear to be recycled from the climactic sequence of park but the sheer number of the creatures here and the genuinely clever way emmerich utilizes them make for a highoctane adrenaline rush and the banal dialogue  particularly in scenes where broderick and pitillo try to sort out their relationship  is spiked with a few witty touches as soon as lorry goldman arrives as a baldpated mayors aide named gene its clear that he and mayor ebert are injokey caricatures of two famous film critics and just to make sure we dont miss the gag goldman makes his exit by giving the mayor an angry thumbsdown godzilla designer and supervisor patrick tatopoulos  whose name is commandeered for brodericks character  does a bangup job of creating a lean  mean monster machine but there is little that is charismatic about his handiwork as a result there is no emotional frisson at the very end even when its obvious that the audience should share brodericks pang of sorrow for thefallen creature size does matter of course but some things matter more the soundtrack is also primed to produce sensory overload as it is very loud  sometimes discomfortingly so but the target audience likely would be surprised if it werent
Feb 14 2008,negative, how much does size matter it matters a great deal to hollywood studios and the very lucrative team of roland emmerich and dean devlin  emmerich directs devlin produces and they work together on the scripts  are a studio execs dream come true with stargate and independence day this dynamic duo proved they could create enormous anticipation  a bulletproof gottaseeit campaign what they cant do its clear by now is make a good movie to go with the brilliant marketing godzilla the new big one from emmerich and devlin achieves the same weird paradox that id4 did it thunders into view with the full weight of event marketing yet the movie itself is completely weightless and like deep impact to cite just the most recent example it zaps you with the spectacle of giant destruction and bores you with puny humaninterest stuff who cares whether biologist matthew broderick and aspiring reporter maria pitillo get back together theres a monster knocking very large holes out of new york city emmerich and devlins genius at arousing anticipation does result in a compelling first reel or so here as in id4 the audience gets excited by the promise that something big is coming but when the somethingbig arrives notice how fast the awe wears off how quickly the audiences giddiness turns to restlessness godzilla goes on for two hours and nineteen minutes a great lumbering beast that has no personality has size but no power am i referring to the movie or the monster both the movie is bad in the same way that id4 was bad it aims low and misses the big action scenes owe just about everything to both jurassic park and the lost world godzilla running amok in new york is a pumpedup version of the t rex menacing san diego and theres an extended sequence involving an army of baby godzillas that blatantly rips off the raptor scenes i have no idea why emmerich and devlin needed to up the ante by infesting madison square garden with minizillas why didnt they leave that for the sequel it adds an unnecessary half hour godzilla himself is fun when he first hits new york but the filmmakers dont find anything imaginative to do with him and they keep him offscreen most of the time while were stuck with broderick whining and jean reno as some special agent and lame humor at the expense of siskel and ebert the original toho godzilla or gojira for all its guyinarubbersuit cheesiness had a lovely clunky charm the new godzilla technically whizbang though it is actually looks bad next to the stopmotion behemoths of ray harryhausen whose it came from beneath the sea appears on a tv in the film and the rubber suits of toho in his obscure book the total filmmaker jerry lewis often refers to the intangibles of film well a monster that has been sculpted and manipulated by hand has a tangible essence a quality of having been worked on that a cgicreated beast however skillful simply doesnt have this godzilla is an intangible in the wrong way after a while godzilla just strikes you as a big cgi blur even the streets and buildings he destroys look cold and computerized the deafening soundtrack tries to sell you size and force but if you watched godzilla with the sound off youd see a parade of thin frantic images this godzilla even forgets to include the traditional cautionary message about nuclear testing its used as an explanation for the monster but then the movie drops it and concerns itself with  how to prevent godzilla from nesting in other words we dont care that we created this thing we just dont want it to reproduce the original gojira was japans metaphor for the terrible mutating power of hiroshima the new americanized version goes after the great monster with the same military technology that dropped the bomb and in this telling hiroshima isnt even the cause  the culprit it turns out is frances nuclear testing blame it on the french the ironies and idiocies swirl together in a bland soup that for some viewers may taste like entertainment others may find it tasteless in both senses of the word

Dec 6 2005,negative, godzilla vs mechagodzilla ii 1993rodan makes his its heisei debut sparring with godzilla and humanity over an egg that ends up containing a newforthe90s version of minilla alternately called babyzilla or godzilla jr meanwhile the united nations antigodzilla task force has a new plan build a pilotable new mechagodzilla it works out about as well as every other plan ever tried against godzilla this is occasionally called a lowpoint in the second series but i think people just didnt cotton to babyzillas overtly kawaii redesign godzilla vs spacegodzilla 1994a giant crystal comet is on a collision course with earth bearing one of godzillas most bizarrelooking and leastimaginatively named foes along with it with a stronger emphasis on beamweapon optical effects and pyrotechnics plus another humanpiloted mech in the form of a new mogera this is sometimes derided as a sentaification of godzilla but its not without its charms godzilla vs destroyer 1995this was the plan toho would for the first time since 54 kill off the original godzilla in a leadup to the 1998 american remake launching a new series it didnt work out obviously but the death of godzilla was a big enough deal at the time to make headlines in the united states how does it go down turns out the oxygen destroyer weapon that solved the problem in 1954 also created a new species of superresilient crustaceanreptile hybrids that have now reached maturity and are swarming the country aliensstyle while godzilla himself is dying but also more powerful and angrier than ever from his own internal nuclear reactor melting down  threatening a cataclysmic event theres a little too much time spent riffing on aliens and starship troopers but the finale is haunting and even poetic as these things go godzilla goes down fighting and takes all of tokyo with him  and leaving a now fully powered junior as his legacy godzilla 2000 1999toho was deeply unhappy with the 1998 american godzilla and even less happy that they didnt get much money out of it the lean gritty and angry millennium series so named to distinguish it from the 80s90s films despite japan still technically being in the heisei era was their response 1954 is the only canon once again but now godzilla is an ohsolate90s conspiracy subject followed around by what wed now call truthers stormchaser style this is also the one that gave us the godzilla is inside each one of us meme
Apr 9 2005,neutral,the look of the film and its fx are interesting to watch and if a less stupid script were involved might have been part of a pretty good flick
Apr 2 2005,negative,a great popcorn movie doesnt have to be wellconstructed all it has to do is to thoroughly entertain you for 2 hours  godzilla doesnt do that
Jan 17 2005,negative,this is the view from the end of the world  we look on the smoking ruin of manhattan and shrug and eat our popcorn
Dec 6 2004,neutral,my suggested tag line for the next emmerichdevlin movie script does matter
Jul 19 2004,negative,wheres stock footage of raymond burr when you need it
Jul 1 2004,neutral,if only one could fastforward past the idiot characters to the parts where the creature nests in madison square garden crushes fifth avenue and chomps a taxicab
Aug 1 2003,negative, directed by roland emmerich godzilla follows several characters including matthew brodericks nick tatopoulos jean renos philippe roaché and hank azarias victor palotti as they attempt to survive after the enormous title creature attacks new york city filmmaker emmerich working from a script written with dean devlin delivers a bloated and mostly tedious endeavor that contains few if any elements designed to capture and sustain the viewers interest which is disappointing to say the least given that the picture admittedly does open with a fair amount of promise  as the comfortably familiar first act having essentially emerged directly from a template for movies of this ilk seemingly paves the way for yet another largerthanlife and propulsively entertaining emmerich endoftheworld thriller theres little doubt however that godzilla eventually progresses into a tedious and hopelessly paddedout midsection that emphasizes the dull exploits of several thinlydrawn and predominantly unappealing human characters and its clear certainly that the nigh interminable atmosphere is exacerbated by an ineffective and hopelessly anticlimactic final third detailing the survivors battle with hundreds of raptorsized monsters  with the end result a low point both for the blockbuster genre and for emmerich himself
Jul 9 2003,negative,unspeakably boring and despicable how anyone could possibly like such a piece of wretched excrement is beyond my comprehension
May 22 2003,negative, sadness is perhaps the best emotion a movie can evoke and it works wonders for films that use it wisely is there a bad kind of sad this film proves that indeed there is godzilla is a sad film you see the monster isnt evil and has no bad intentions until the end when it gets very mad it never intentionally kills a human except in selfdefense its just pregnant hungry and cranky and yet the filmmakers are so needlessly cruel to the creature that it makes this creature feature damn near unwatchable its just a bad kind of sad its not the kind that leaves you feeling entertained but the kind that leaves you feeling bad like youve just endured a traumatic experience oh but the movie isnt poignant no such luck and its certainly not trying to say anything to the viewer and its hard to tell  was director ronald emmerich trying to make us sympathize with the creature if so which i doubt he both succeeded and failed we sympathized but were crushed by the ending oh right like you didnt already know what it was as for the special effects  they are indeed spectacular as a matter of fact they are the best special effects that i have seen perhaps ever but they dont entertain why well for starters the script to support the effects is a total botch the worst ive seen since mr nice guy the human performances certainly leave something to be desired and since the movie is little more than one long pointless chase scene the action gets tiresome by the time the climax comes around we are sick of godzilla we are tired by the effects and personally by that time i was so pissed off at the human characters that i was cheering for the monster makes it really anticlimactic
