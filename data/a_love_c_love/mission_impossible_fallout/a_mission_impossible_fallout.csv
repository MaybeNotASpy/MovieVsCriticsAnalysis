Apr 10 2024,positive,your mission is do you choose to accept it
Apr 3 2024,positive,classic film that continues to carry forward the characteristics of the old films but this time with a slightly more elaborate plot a great advantage of the film is the soundtrack and the settings the fight scenes are excellent and super enjoyable
Mar 29 2024,positive,mission impossible 6 fallout is a great iteration on the series  overall the series has improved with each movie mi 2 the exception i love that they continue to play with the masks and show the fallibility of them the comedy in the series keeps it manageable and prevents the movie from sinking into a dark hole the returning characters are great and the explanations for plot points generally make sense the stunts are amazing and the chase and vehicle scenes are the best in cinema right now     unfortunately the final resolution is as unrealistic and bombastically over the top as anything i have seen recently i hated the end of star trek the remake for the fight on top of the moving vehicles this movie is no different physics defying combat on the train and with the helicopters and on top of the rock pull me out of the scenes i wish they could maintain some sense of realism in the movie while still being as tense and exciting   overall great movies so well made  a pinnacle of movie making tech and skill the plots are ridiculous but still manage to make it almost to the end without unraveling good entertainment for sure

Dec 27 2023,positive,arguably the best from the franchise the action scenes just keep getting better the set pieces in this are peak cinema
Dec 24 2023,positive,plenty of spills  chills  i have to wonder why crazy cruise keeps trying to kill himself to do stunts for a movie  hes now in his 60s i dont like him as a person so couldnt care less if he doesnt make it much longer

Dec 4 2023,positive,exciting and adventurous
Nov 25 2023,positive,i could wax poetic but instead ill simply say this is the best action movie ive ever seen  full stop
Nov 11 2023,positive,tom cruise returns as the charismatic and undeniably daring ethan hunt proving once again that he is the ultimate action hero his commitment to performing his own stunts is nothing short of mindblowing and it adds an extra layer of authenticity to the jawdropping action sequences from a thrilling halo jump to a bonecrunching bathroom brawl cruise takes us on a wild journey that will have you on the edge of your seat gasping in awe      but its not just cruise who shines in this film the supporting cast is equally impressive simon pegg injects the perfect amount of wit and humor as the techsavvy benji and ving rhames brings a sense of loyalty and gravitas as the dependable luther henry cavill joins the team as the relentless cia operative august walker bringing his own brand of rugged intensity to the mix    its a race against time and as the tension builds so does the intensity of the action sequences from highspeed chases through the streets of paris to a breathtaking helicopter chase in the mountains of kashmir every moment feels like a pulsepounding spectacle    mission impossible  fallout is an exhilarating rollercoaster of a movie that delivers exactly what fans of the franchise crave and more its a highoctane adventure that combines jawdropping stunts gripping storytelling and a stellar cast to create an unforgettable cinematic experience so buckle up prepare for the impossible and get ready to be thoroughly entertained this is one mission you wont want to miss
Nov 6 2023,positive,the sixth installment in the popular action franchise mission impossible  fallout sees ethan hunt tom cruise attempt to track down stolen plutonium cores before a mysterious extremist uses them to prompt a major terror event    akin to some of the previous movies in this series the prologue presents a new challenge to hunt and his team and they lose though they make up for that a bit before the opening titles kick in the main character arc for cruises seemingly infallible character being the debate whether his attachment to individuals and the fact he cares about people makes him an asset or in fact quite the opposite weakens him its an interesting look at a sometimes underdeveloped character and it gives the film a welcome amount of depth    simon pegg and ving rhames are back as hunts sidekicks as is rebecca fergusons mi6 agent ilsa faust with henry cavills august walker joining the team somewhat reluctantly in order to keep an eye on hunt though the team is mostly dealing with the psychotic foe from the last movie sean harris solomon lane they are also chasing a ghost an elusive new puppetmaster who turns out to be behind that whole plutonium business and lanes escape the film clearly takes a page out of the last few bond films by upping the ante while still having some semblance of continuity    one could argue that this latest mission impossible film didnt need to be as layered as it is and some might find it to be needlessly convoluted however directorwriter christopher mcquarrie keeps the plot going at a brisk pace and delivers enough impressive nailbiting action sequences to make it so that even if you could easily cut bits and pieces out of this movie you wouldnt necessarily want to take anything out of it the action scenes are particularly good in this one the motorcycle and helicopter chases are very intense and very cool    this is a much more memorable and epic outing than rogue nation which was competent and had its moments but failed to really stand out like the previous film did or this one incidentally cruise is his usual reliable self and ethan hunts emotional struggle throughout gives the actor a bit more to work with while the supporting cast does a generally good job even if benji pegg is still nothing more than a onedimensional bad joke making machine and has frankly overstayed his welcome at this point    mission impossible  fallout breathes some new life into a franchise that was very close to once again falling into a bit of a rut the set pieces are exciting the cast is terrific there are some clever surprises along the way and the third act is masterful    one of the best in the franchise
Nov 3 2023,negative,i have never seen this movie a hit the stars and can not delete it 
Nov 2 2023,positive,one of my favorite mission impossible films great stunts plot and cast tom cruise is great in this see this film
Oct 27 2023,positive,fast paced beautifully shot and some great one linerseverything a good action movie should be very entertaining
Oct 27 2023,positive,inventive stunts breathtaking cinematography and a twisty narrative make this one of the great action films of the 2010s
Oct 22 2023,positive,pulling off a stunt more impossible than its predecessor mission impossible  fallout keeps trying to top itself and successfully so
Oct 16 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic
Oct 10 2023,positive,definitely in the top 10 action movies of all time   in mifo cruise turns action into an artform
Sep 6 2023,positive,this movie continually raises the bar in stakes tension fun spectacular setpieces and so much more theres nothing more you could want in an action film
Sep 2 2023,positive,best action of all mission impossible movies and in my opinion the best from everything this was a really good movie and a perfect energy movie to watch just so good the action and the drone shots were unreal the music was fantastic and this basically is a movie i would consider as a perfect action movie
Aug 27 2023,positive,having just finished the last mission impossible movie i was more than eager to continue but to be fair i was worried because im a fan of the dceu movies and i learned that this movie was the reason for the bad cgi that was done in the justice league movie but having enjoyed those last two movies i wasnt going to let that bother me    ethan hunt and the rest of the impossible mission force have a new lease on life having destroyed a terrorist group known as the syndicate and incarcerated its leader but every victory brings forward another battle and this one is over the remnants of the syndicate with a traitor among the us intelligence this traitor has ushered in the theft of three nuclear weapons and threatens to use them ethan has his allies both old and new but ends up realizing the danger behind whoever the traitor is worse than what they could ever imagine    this was another great entry in the mission impossible movies the beginning starts great with the middle somewhat iffy but the climax was phenomenal the best tom cruise delivers as always rebecca ferguson simon pegg and ving rhames are splendid returns simon harris was great again as the villain of the story it was certainly interesting seeing henry cavill sport the mustache that destroyed a franchise but i guess i can understand why it had to be used for this movie all in all a good movie but it loses some traction with me
Aug 21 2023,positive,best out of all and a lot to live up to here henry and tom perfect set up and roles for films a must watch for all
Aug 10 2023,positive,executed so perfectly that the odd cliché becomes completely irrelevant
Aug 8 2023,positive,in my opinion this movie is perfect simple but great plot line fun characters an actually shocking twist villain and phenomenal action this is all topped off with the halo jump scene which is an amazing stunt watch now absolutely worth the time
Aug 8 2023,positive,i liked the action scenes and the fact that artificial intelligence was the villain of the movie this one in particular does not have the optimism of the other films in the saga but it is more real and human
Aug 6 2023,positive,loved it cant wait to watch the new ones
Aug 6 2023,positive,my favorite mission impossible film so many edge of your seat thrills
Aug 5 2023,neutral,worst mission impossible movie ive seen tbh not very good

Jul 29 2023,positive,mission impossible fallout brings more resourceful materials of action as it just phenomenal in every aspect as it keeps bringing more and more clever ideas
Jul 28 2023,positive,best mi franchise ever rating in 2023 all mixture and ingredients blended perfectly action scenes at the good sequence
Jul 28 2023,positive,one of the best action films ever made tom cruise gives us a strongly plotted ride
Jul 28 2023,positive,tom cruise shines again in the 6th outing of the popular franchise directed by christopher mcquarrie this is one of my favorites of the series ethan hunt is joined again by ving rhames as luther simon pegg as scotty and rebecca ferguson as illsa newcomers include henry cavill angela bassett and vanessa kirby here the imf have to recover a device setting off a nuclear weapon from falling into a group called the apostles a bio terrorist offshoot of the syndicate theyre dealing with the fallout of the sydicate and the capture of their leader solomon lane john lark is the main unknown extremist leader that ethan must hunt down and three plutonium cores illsa comes back too after retiring from the spy business wanting to assassinate lark elanna aka the white widow also comes into the picture to buy the cores selling them on the black market cia director erika sloane is also on the verge of shutting down the imf because of ethans recklessness to go above and beyond call of duty choosing his friends over the mission ethan is a man unwilling to sacrifice anyone while soloman and lark are willing to dispose of everyone after all how many times has hunts own government betrayed him and given him so many chances its about looking inward vs outward way better than rogue nation sweeping cinematography as well as an insight into ethans psyche wanting to protect the innocent this fits with our times of tearing down institutions are there modern politics anyone can show up with a deadly weapon do we still need spies to save the world should our concerns be more international or more solitary can tragedy ensure long lasting peace what if things fall apart with one or two elements can ruin it all its true governments dont like each other even if we have friendships with other countries we dont want to share secrets this one has more insane stunts which keep upping the ante more relying on practical effects giving it an authentic feel not to mention great sound editing and being amazingly photographed the helicopter fight near the end is the most impressive the way its filmed staged and using aerial dogfight maneuvers a slight sense of goofiness keeps things staying afloat without being too dour plus this leveled up rebecca fergusons presence as illsa while providing an equal match for ethan it also stays more true to the roots of the original tv show being the most selfaware of the films mcquarrie makes this all about the illusion of ethans team thinking on their feet while being topical choosing impossible missions to save the world im also very happy they managed to wrap up a lot dangling plot lines from previous films despite being 2 hours and 27 minutes they make this experience a very intense ride
Jul 27 2023,positive,veeery good action movie every new mission impossible is better than the last one  i love the characters and just everything about it 1010
Jul 26 2023,positive,the mission impossible series just keeps improving and this feature doesnt disappoint
Jul 26 2023,positive,9310  yeah definitely the best movie in this franchise here we got the best action choreography best camera work and cinematography i mean we got fking henry cavill as a villain im still not the biggest fan of rebecca ferguson because she cant decide on which side shes on and you dont always understand what shes doing
Jul 25 2023,neutral,the makers were so fixated on creating cliffhanger moments that they overlooked plotholes and cliche elements
Jul 25 2023,positive,combining the best qualities of the franchise into one fantastic action spectaclewhile being thoughtprovoking emotionally charged and having the best screenplay the series has seen so far mission impossible  fallout sets the standard for how action movies should be and tom cruise truly outdoes himself with every stunt he performs
Jul 24 2023,positive,one if the best action movies ever made with a completely unrelenting pace
Jul 24 2023,positive,this movie is the definitive mi movie the action is great the thrills are great the stakes are great its perfect henry cavill is exceptional in this movie
Jul 24 2023,positive,yes would watch again and recommend watched in prep for the latest mi film crazy that tom cruise does his own stunts
Jul 23 2023,positive,when this first became availble on dvd i bought it and was not disappointed with the presentation ethan hunttom cruise continues to deliver all the thrills and spills of earlier mission films it was interesting to see august walkerhenry cavill as the antagonist    this franchise has attracted my attention since the first in the series we are lucky to have a standout actor such as cruise who never fails to give his very best to any movie he is in
Jul 23 2023,positive,mission impossible  fallout sets a new benchmark for action films delivering nonstop thrills an engaging plot and showcasing tom cruises dedication to performing daring stunts
Jul 22 2023,positive,the mission impossible fallout was a good movie to me bast action of the year henry cavill was bast action bad guy tom cruise was perfect action hero 
Jul 22 2023,positive,wowsimply incredible
Jul 22 2023,positive,the movie would be suitable for someone who has just been introduced to the series as if this was the first movie they have seen from the series otherwise it was just like one of the other six movies in the series minus part 3 which was a nice break away from the norms of most of the movies it has just run its course like several other movie series out there it is time for something new to come out with some genuinely unique plots tom was excellent in the first jack reacher which was a fantastic movie and a breath of fresh air in a time when movies were dragging pretty low like right now
Jul 21 2023,positive,sure it follows the formula established by the other mi films but its still a lot of fun definitely one of the top summer movies this year
Jul 21 2023,positive,the movie was solid addition to the mi franchise and it all the same beats as the previous interactions but the movies feels like it stayed too long on certain scenes and the overall movie would of benefited for a 20 minute chop to the run times which i would normally defend for other 2 hrs plus movies like oppenheimer or across the spiderverse
Jul 21 2023,positive,another solid entry from the imf team a fun adventure with absurd premises setting up ridiculous stunts that are executed so well you feel engaged and suspenseful     henry cavil is a great addition and plays off tom cruise well the twists and turns that happen in the underground bunker scene set up the second half of the movie very well and i honestly didnt see any of them coming
Jul 21 2023,positive,what a amazing wonderful movie 
Jul 21 2023,positive,clearly the best of all the mi outings great writing the action is excellent as expected and tom cruise proves hes still got it
Jul 21 2023,positive,tom is as handsome as everwhateverifm will change the impossible into possible
Jul 21 2023,positive,imagine every other franchise how many get to 7 sequels and are still enjoyable not many tom cruise is amazing in that way keeping this franchise fresh this movie is good could have been great but went a little overboard with the set pieces lots of fun was extra long and not over long im very interested in next years final piece underwater anyone
Jul 20 2023,positive,my god theyve done it again say what you want about tc but hes one hell of an actorstuntmanwriter sure hes crazy but wow ill take his crazy if he can keep pumping out awesome movies like this edge of seat for the entire movie simon pegg has also transformed from the goofy side kick to a much more serious dramatic actor great work all around 
Jul 19 2023,positive,completely enthralling the writing is so tightly crafted that espionage has never been so perfectly twisting heart racing suspense action  stunts all beautifully filmed with a human foundation
Jul 19 2023,positive,the most perfect mission impossible to date and i have not seen mi7 yet everything that had room for improvement in the previous installments were more than improved they peaked in quality the entire film was a home run for the franchise great character work wonderful continuation of the villain story from mi5 as well as the continuation of rebecca fergusons character alec baldwins character and even ethan hunts wife the team is on absolute top form in this film henry cavills walker is a terrific equal to tom cruises hunt the score is very moving and by far the best in the series thus far the cinematography and fight choreography is absolutely stunning the action scenes and vfx also hit a new high and the film is by far the most cinematically beautiful in the franchise mi7 had big shoes to fill
Jul 19 2023,positive,the best of the franchise
Jul 19 2023,negative,too many chase scenes not enough content and no love interest one of the most operated movies in a long time
Jul 19 2023,positive,i cant get over how stupid it is to think ethan hunt is going to fly through a train window everything else was awesome
Jul 18 2023,positive,not as good as rogue nation but still a great movie i liked that they kept sean harris and rebecca ferguson ilsa brings a lot to the table and makes the team feel complete cavill was a great addition and delivers an excellent performance the plot is where i feel the film falls short nuclear weapons again feel repetitive and there is a point in the movie where too many twists tangle and are just a little bit too much another thing i did not like was the very if not extremely unrealistic parts i know action movies are meant to be that way it just surpassed my personal limit on how much of it i accept however the best action sequences in the franchise along with cruises stunts make up for that and deliver
Jul 18 2023,positive,this film took everything good from each of the previous ones and said were going to make the best spy movie ever the action seen in chases fights shootouts and increasingly impossible missions made the franchises longest story to date feel short because how good it is t at this point we already become attached to the characters and henry cavills performance gave that brawler touch to the situation definitely the best in the entire franchise
Jul 18 2023,positive,absolute must see for everyone   better then avatar  i am like obsessed with it  good job on casting and music score
Jul 17 2023,positive,mission impossible fallout is something bigger  better than any other mission that needs acceptance
Jul 17 2023,positive,an action packed blockbuster this movie is incredible at progressing the plot in the most entertaining way
Jul 17 2023,positive,the best action movie ever made
Jul 17 2023,positive,this movie is done perfectly and the mission impossible frachise is turning into unbeatable action movies
Jul 17 2023,positive,i was worried that this 2 and a half hour movie would be too long  it was action packed from the get go with a relevant  plot around hot topic of the day  ai  the twists and turns the stunts and cinematography were awesome   my biggest complaint was that when it was over i wanted more  def going to watch again
Jul 16 2023,positive,a fun popcorn flick  pretty entertaining and good action scenes
Jul 16 2023,negative,i tired to thiswhat next mission impossible vs godzilla disaster movieall digitalbad directionthis is hollywood decadencemy recommendation download for free
Jul 15 2023,positive,amazing sets storyline and fight choreographies this nonstop action thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat
Jul 15 2023,neutral,maybe more a criticism of whats happened to the genre as this is not the worst offender but the emotionless poorly plotted and derivative nature of this movie makes it plain boring endless silly escape after endless silly car chase after endless silly mcguffins put me to sleep i just wanted it to show anything original or just end
Jul 15 2023,positive,good movie but it feels very generic
Jul 15 2023,positive,good but not great the usual fun action flic by tom cruise is a lot of fun but had to be seen in the theatre for proper enjoyment
Jul 14 2023,positive,mission impossible 6  fallout is another amazing action packed thriller with some of the best action scenes that the mission impossible franchise has to offer the nonstop action scenes just keep getting better and better and we finally get so much more connections to some of the previous films this movie proves that the mission impossible franchise is one of the best action movie franchises of all time
Jul 13 2023,positive,will crusie save us from the bomb
Jul 12 2023,positive,this is one of my favorite mission impossible movies yet
Jul 12 2023,positive,an intense action epic brimming with thrills    christopher mcquarrie directs an espionage action thriller that is massive in scope ambitious in realism and stunning in execution mission impossible  fallout 2018 goes to multiple exotic locales shot beautifully and with memorable cinematography the stunt work is immaculate with real stunts executed by tom cruise the halo jump is breathtaking the bathroom fight is cool and the gunplay is visceral the fight choreography is brutal and feels like the punches have weight    tom cruise is the main draw as always his dedication to performing the stunts for real is admirable but his dramatic acting as ethan hunt is still my favorite part cruise is the ultimate action star but also an accomplished dramatic actor he runs all over the world jumps from roof to roof actually flies a helicopter jumps from a plane fights men in hand to hand combat and shoots firearms constantly in the most exhilarating mission impossible film yet i may prefer rogue nation and ghost protocol more still but fallout is a close third for the best mission impossible movie for sure    the supporting cast is particularly notable this time around with excellent performances all around cruises ethan hunt is offset well by the always hilarious simon pegg as benji who finally gets more to do in the franchise newcomer henry cavill is intimidating and formidable as august walker cavill holds his own both in combat and drama alike     surprisingly ving rhames is not only back but he also gets to deliver more weighted dramatic dialogue i really liked his performance here he carries himself with an earnest concern for ethan as well as a likable presence as luther stickell likewise alec baldwin has a brief but incredibly memorable role reprising his part as alan hunley youll like him in fallout     similarly rebecca ferguson kills it again as ilsa faust she is cool smart and interesting as ethan hunts foil and love interest i wish there were even more of ferguson she could easily play the lead in the next movie next michelle monaghan makes a neat cameo with some serious lines and a touching delivery i was disappointed that her character goes in the direction they went with but i understand lastly for the ladies angela bassett gets a small but integral role as the head of the cia erica sloane i hope she appears in more mission impossible movies    in regards to the villains sean harris is frightening and monstrous as solomon lane harris is even scarier than he was in rogue nation also vanessa kirby is sultry and intriguing as white widow i wonder if theyll bring her back as she has potential for more on screen crime she is pleasantly good in fallout overall the entire ensemble is excellently well cast and aptly utilized     all in all you will be entertained by fallout i think there is plenty here for any audience fast paced action character progression enjoyable dialogue intriguing story clever fake outs and funny jokes fallout is phenomenal
Jul 12 2023,positive,in my opinion this is the greatest action movie ive ever seen i have yet to see dead reckoning though
Jul 12 2023,positive,loved it all totally worth watching except u should watch the others before this one so it makes more sense
Jul 12 2023,positive,best movie of the year so far
Jul 12 2023,positive,this is one of the best mission impossible film l have ever watch you must watch this awesome film
Jul 12 2023,negative,tom cruise playing tom cruise nothing new interesting exciting or fresh its time to retire this franchise or bring in a different cast
Jul 12 2023,positive,this was the best mission impossible movie before dead reckoning maybe a little bit too much profanity but other than that this was a great movie
Jul 11 2023,positive,best action film ive seen in over a decade
Jul 11 2023,positive,man idk if this is a hot take or not but i love this movie ive seen this before but it still subverted my expectations at every turn  this movie doesnt hold back whatever can happen will plus its got a great score tom cruise running like a muppet and mfing simon pegg    this is exactly what these movies should be
Jul 11 2023,positive,ethan hunts finest outing of the franchise fallout delivers a sense of urgency that doesnt stop until the end it also showcases the franchises finest villain and tom cruises coolest stunts
Jul 11 2023,positive,tom cruise continues to turn up the heat with mission impossible fallout an action packed thrill ride that beats its predecessors by a landslide
Jul 10 2023,positive,ive seen tom cruise run before ive seen tom cruise car chase before ive seen tom cruise get in a helicopter fight before i suppose this just bumped it up a notch
Jul 10 2023,positive,u know tom never disappoint
Jul 10 2023,positive,this movie might be the high water mark for the franchise the action the acting the plot is all extremely well done and dam near perfect
Jul 10 2023,positive,its getting crazy how the action canon keeps firing with more explosive ammo the production team keep ensuring the franchise pushes to enthral and entertain as well as to find new possibilities for scenarios in a saturated film genre they work in keeping this a standout franchise and polishing tcs standing as one of the best in the game a truly brilliant story with a lot to love
Jul 9 2023,positive,tom just raise the bar higher with every stunt this movie was epic just watched it today all the people were clapping their hands when the movie was over tom must win an oscar period
Jul 9 2023,positive,fast fun and full of plot twists you dont see coming missions impossible characters continue to develop breathing further life into one of my favorite action franchises
Jul 9 2023,positive,what an evolution this franchise had the first one was good but it was still just a normal 90s spyaction movie now fallout is simply one of the best action movies from hollywood from one action set piece to another with good breathing space in between   the previous movie was the first time it felt like it really wanted the characters to be more than plot devices and gave enough to the supporting characters as well as showing ethan hunt for what he is a gambler this movie takes everything that worked in rogue nation and perfected it theres even more to the characters as well as every action setpieces being some of the best ever in movies proper use of action and the other moments really elevate it the moments where the use of silence instead of music was perfect the new cast including henry cavill and vanessa kirby were brilliant   this cleanly wrapped up some previous plot points properly but this kind of makes me question if they really dont consider mi2 canon because even when they acknowledge almost everything else that is not at all acknowledged maybe a hint of an acknowledgement but that can be read differently too   each and every action scene was so great and commendable but i got to give it for the chase scenes the previous movie had a great bike chase scene too but this one really made the perfect chase scene in my opinion especially watching the fast and furious franchise before this and even the previous movies in this franchise i believe i have never seen chase scenes so cleanly and clearly before everything about the chase scene was clearly distinguishable even when we can clearly see how fast they are going and the way the bike moved looks perfect the way it moves when the brake is applied the sudden turns etc looked so authentic in a way that i have never seen in any movie before even the sound effect of it when moving through that pavement with pillars on the side the sound that can be heard was so on point it made me so happy to see that  theres so much more about each and every point of this movie that worked so well and that too is being inside a plot that is another simple derivative one the only issue i had is that it still made the villains actions quite justifiable at each and every turn the supposedly good agencies easily sacrifice anything they can that the syndicate or the apostles really seem reasonable at the end when they justify the existence of imf i can only hear the justification of ethan hunt and not the agency im excited to see how theyre gonna explore all this in dead reckoning
Jul 9 2023,positive,really enjoyed this movie great action and stunts and also had a great plot
Jul 8 2023,positive,last true hollywood super star

Jun 15 2023,positive,a huge gap between fallout and the rest of the series for me fallout has intense sequences and great action still there is a few things i could nitpick about but a entry that i am actually positive about 710
Jun 7 2023,positive,one of the best mission impossible movies of all time it was predictable but still was a good movie
May 27 2023,positive,i feel like the moment most of us saw henry cavills beautifully combed finely groomed and synderverse toppling moustache we knew it was worth it fallout is the current apex of the mission impossible series at the time of writing dead reckoning part one is less than two months away now it takes everything we loved about the series delivers more of what weve come to expect and yet it still manages to blow us away the first time i watched this in imax i genuinely thought ethan had lost it doesnt help that there were two moments within the film that faked me out into thinking that bravo christopher mcquarrie bravo    seemingly every adventure thats come before is homaged or outright referenced in one form or another be it vanessa kirbys white widow the daughter of arms dealer max from mi1 or ethans superhuman rock climbing ability from mi2 theres a genuine attempt to tie the franchise together as a whole after quite some time the unstoppable duo of mcquarrie and cruise are clearly a match made in heaven mcquarrie creating tense muscular cleanly shot and edited set pieces where you never lose your bearings once again bringing the franchise to literally new heights lorne balfes score is another banger for the franchise and one of my favourite renditions of the classic theme to boot but it does get a bit nolanesque in parts which im not a huge fan of    the cast is once again on top form thankfully bringing back sean harris solomon lane from the previous outing to give him much more to say and do with the door thankfully left open for him once again although i feel that might be it harris delightful calm and collected rage are balanced out brilliantly by the everreloading biceps of henry cavills walker more than a match for hunt physically as he is in pure resilience although i will say alec baldwin suckerpunching cavill in the face was a personal highlight for some reason i cannot even begin to describe speaking of baldwin again glad hes back but his role in the latter half of the film feels like it should have really been jeremy renners brandt although given the outcome of that scene im glad it wasnt    love it or hate it fallout more than lives up to the impossible part of mission impossible the action is brutal and gutpunching the pacing heartpumping and the stakes so high its gaspinducing at times it draws together the best aspects of every movie before it giving off classic vibes but never being afraid to evolve
May 16 2023,positive,the cinematography in fallout is flawless the transition after ethans mission self destructs is gorgeous and i rewound it three times because it was so clean the biggest flaw in my mind is the white widow i think that her character is completely unnecessary and i found her scenes bland and boring that being said the bathroom fight before meeting her at the club was brilliant finishing off the film the climactic 15minute countdown was the most captivated i have been in film in a long time i was glued to the screen in addition bringing back ethans wife julia was a perfect conclusion to her characters story arc rather than have an ambiguous end to her story she is given a new beginning not only that but she cleared ethans conscious and allowed him to move forward with ilsa and the imf
May 1 2023,positive,this movie was just great nothing else
Apr 20 2023,positive,every mission impossible movie gets better and better mission impossible 6 is the best one since so far

Apr 13 2023,positive,seamlessly entertaining the whole watch always leaving you on your toes the characters are amazing the villain is great and the action is top tier     i love this freaking movie guys
Apr 9 2023,positive,brilliant movie the only reason i give it 4 but not 5 stars is that we did not connect at all to henry cavills character that would have been great
Apr 2 2023,positive,this has no right to be this good this is easily the best of the franchise its just a shame it took so long to get this incredible this is pure white knuckle action on par with the best action films ever made everything fundamentally speaking is phenomenal where the acting is very good in its own right the real live stunt work sends it over the top the practical effects are jaw dropping and some of the best ever put to screen this is an all time classic everyone should see once
Mar 26 2023,positive,it was really really good
Mar 24 2023,positive,one of the greatest action movies ever made tom cruise is a madman
Mar 15 2023,positive,the best of the mission impossible moviesso far
Mar 12 2023,positive,i am not one whod be considered a mission impossible fan i honestly havent seen enough of the series to form an opinion  for one reason or another i had put this entry in my watch list and became somewhat obsessive with it until finally  i got the chance for a good viewing of it  mission impossible fallout is an action film that is intense and fast paced while remaining coherent  as i mentioned i havent seen all of the mi movies let alone in order but of the ones i have seen this is the one that made me want to see the rest of them in order
Feb 20 2023,positive,i went in because of the reviews i came out with a mediocre movie each action scene was funnier than the last i found myself laughing most of the movie maybe actually its not that bad
Feb 17 2023,positive,the best instalment of the franchise so far particularly loved the soundtrack and how the original has been edited the films unpredictability is a win and the cast is outstanding
Feb 15 2023,positive,its just crazy how good these movies are they absolutely kick the s out of james bond movies
Feb 10 2023,negative,o mon dieu this is so cliché i wanna vomit the story line as much as the action remind me of when i was 8 years old fighting bad guys in my backyard
Feb 2 2023,positive,this movie really delivers tom cruise as always puts his heart and soul into his work phenomenal set pieces the bathroom fight sequence is a particular highlight this franchise really is going from strength to strength highly recommended
Jan 24 2023,positive,good movie good plot good acting good imagery  i recommend
Jan 7 2023,positive,fallout is an above average action movie to be sure but it doesnt feel like a mission impossible movie to me again really great car  motorcycle chase and eventually helicopter chase and action but there are no stunts or spectacles in the scale and style i expect from mission impossible until 2 hours into the movie thats too late and even then there is no iconic setpiece eg the dubai tower the kremlin the water cooling station in 5 etc its a bit chatty mcquarrie loves his dialogue and plot heavy and doesnt have the gadgets or elaborate heist sequence weve come to expect at some point in every mi film so good action movie but off brand and a bit of a disappointment for a mission impossible movie
Dec 31 2022,positive,2 12 hours of constant action kept me on the edge of my seat great story great cast tom cruise is so good
Dec 28 2022,positive,good very good henrys character was something solid toilet fight scene and loading biceps

Dec 9 2022,positive,fallout is the best of the series built with a simple yet complicated plot that provides an alwaysgoing exciting sense of thrill all throughout real freefalling sequences real car chases real helicopter duels and real cliffscaling this movie has some of the greatest action sequences in cinematic history incredibly outstanding cinematography a perfect score impeccable editing and the unstoppable tom cruise fallout is an actionpacked beyondthrilling movie experience you dont wanna miss it also happens to be one of my favorite movies of all time

Nov 21 2022,positive,if you can accept the ridiculous helicopter scene it is an excellent movie
Nov 15 2022,positive,incredible the best mission yet to date
Nov 12 2022,positive,why not henry in the movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,actionpacked super fast humorous serious and brilliantly entertaining mission impossible fallout remains one of 2018s quinteessential movies with tom cruise once again delivering on the performance as ethan hunt combine that with a fantastic supporting cast and graphics and wit that few movies ever can recreate this movie is without a doubt amongs the franchises finest installments
Oct 29 2022,positive,of course five stars are a lot and so the movie has to be perfect  or at least almost perfect  and if you look at mission impossible  fallout you have this perfection the storyline is amazingly written the actors and actresses are so god damn talented and did a lovely job its easy to hate the bad guy and for me it was a surprise to see who the bad guy was   i loved how tom cruise managed it to get henry cavill into the team and of course simon pegg was the hero of the hearts  just as always  theres only one thing i was sad about william brandt wasnt there i know it has something to do with jeremy renner and the fact that he had to play in the avengers instead but still i missed the sarcasm  but in the end i can say that everybody should see mission impossible and im very hyped for part 7
Oct 23 2022,positive,not only the best of its franchise but also the best action movie of all time
Oct 17 2022,positive,this movie is definitely one of my favourites of all time everything about it is so brilliant and powerful the plot characters stunts you name it tom cruise has been brilliant in the role of ethan hunt once again showing why hes the guy to keep leading the series simon pegg benji ving rhames luther and rebecca ferguson ilsa are outstanding support actors to make up ethans team with sean harris solomon lane and henry cavill walker terrific in their roles as the bad guys plus adding julia created that little edge to the mission for ethan i really admired the attitude of ethan as he never gives up regardless of what happens which makes quite an impression i thought that the plot was really gripping putting nuclear bombs in always raises the stakes and excitement i thought the stunts and camera work were amazing too especially with cruise doing the stunts himself i loved the camera shots during the paris chase the rooftop sprint through london and the final battle between ethan and walker which i thought was a masterpiece this film went to some lengths to get it right mcquarrie amazing director i would totally recommend this film if you havent watched it already
Oct 15 2022,positive,best in the series no doubt awesome
Oct 15 2022,positive,great continuation with great execution the actions and story is perfectly packed with the unexpected twist to it
Oct 14 2022,positive,one of the better action movies ever made fitting precursor to the alltime classic top gun maverick ruined a bit by alec baldwin actually shooting and killing someone
Sep 24 2022,positive,as good as an action film gets this franchise just keeps raising the bar tom cruise should be far too old for this but he simply isnt completely wonderful and cannot wait for the next ones
Sep 19 2022,positive,another midas touch from tom cruise this latest iteration delivers excitement dangerous stunts and high stakes alongside a stellar cast and bigger explosions and chases
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 12 2022,positive,action movie masterpiece  no complicated plot but a simple pleasant symphony of tc stunts  and mcquarries writing  everything you could ask for and more incredible conflict developed character in a subtle but pleasing manner and perfect scenes of pure cinema with stakes theme and urgency layed out in an impeccable way
Sep 12 2022,positive,mission impossible fallout is a great spy action movie with interesting plot twists topnotch acting and an entertaining pace  although the story is quite predictable and repetitive in these films the great staging on camera the spectacular editing and the great action sequences make this film one of the best in the saga
Sep 6 2022,positive,mission impossible fallout is one of the best action movie i have ever seen mission impossible fallout has one of the best action scene in the franchise tom cruise ethan hunt did some of the best stunts in the franchise the film has great story and a great plot twist with henry cavill joining the cast and he plays august walker very well my favorite part of the film is definitely the helicopter chase overall 1010
Sep 6 2022,positive,fast going far and beyond and thrilling from the beginning mission impossible  fallout takes it high points and doesnt to amaze us with tom cruises stunt work and performance
Aug 31 2022,neutral,i really feel im too old for this type of movies because i cant really understand the hype
Aug 17 2022,positive,this is the best action movie of the 2010s period the music suspense twists stunts sequences all top notch and pretty much perfect the skydiving scene motorcycle chase foot chase and helicopter chase are all spectacles of good action filmmaking tom cruise still amazed with what he can do at his age and this blew me away when i saw it in theaters best mission impossible movie and one of the top spy movies of all time it likely wont get any better than this
Aug 6 2022,positive,after 30 minuts of movie i think this part will be more borying then last parts but at finally 30 minuts i undestanded what this film is good no perfect cliche have been deleted majority but i like first parts because in them was stealth and parkur scene in the next parts thrm added less and less but this movie have enought cool moments in it
Aug 6 2022,positive,incredible film the missions just keep getting crazier and crazier
Aug 4 2022,positive,great movie amazing must see
Aug 1 2022,positive,tom cruises ethan hunt is tasked with a new mission retrieve three potential nuclear weapons that have gotten into the wrong hands before theyre detonated  as with all the mission impossible movies theyre so impressively made and continue to up the ante when it comes to stunt work and big set pieces this film is highly entertaining with gripping suspense and action  does it need to be two and a half hours long  probably not but its a small complaint in an otherwise excellent action and intrigue movie
Jul 29 2022,positive,i think its the best mission impossible movie it repeats the same formula of the entire saga but also questions and tests ethan hunt as a hero who could become a villain and the action of this thing is wonderful  thanks tom cruise
Jul 24 2022,positive,my rating for the film is a 8710
Jul 23 2022,positive,the perfect spy movie tom cruise pulls off spectacular stunts with perfect hair funny entertaining and a blast with every plot twist the mission impossible movies are known for a perfect film
Jul 22 2022,positive,this was amazing and tom cruise on point as always you can tell the cgi from the real thing and trust me the real thing  makes it so much better
Jul 21 2022,positive,i predict youll receive exactly what you anticipate actionpacked explosive and full of badassdom with excellent direction tension and humour when its called for one does yearn for a film like this with a dash of macfarlanean whimsy if you know what i mean it becomes a little bit too serious to be taken seriously
Jul 17 2022,positive,very good movie with great action and a great cast the action sequences fit in the story well
Jul 9 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jul 4 2022,positive,an actionpacked prologue combined with mcquarries script and direction the performances of the cast balfes score hardys cinematography hamiltons editing wenhams production design set decoration by azis putman and tolley kurlands costume design action sequences sound design and visual effects  mission impossible  fallout sets up the conclusion of ethan hunts story with mesmurizing results
Jun 29 2022,positive,the best mission impossible movie ever packed with awesome action and amazing performances pushing on ethan hunts story with a great addition this movie definitely hits the epicness and awesomeness it was aiming for with its powerful action and beautiful cast keeping this movie completely engaging and entirely entertaining never missing a single draw out on any part of the movie this movie was bold and powerful with awesome visuals and great sequences that had you on the edge of your seat the whole time
Jun 28 2022,positive,all this put together the halo jump bathroom fight car chases and helicopter sequence added up for me is the greatest action movie ever made
Jun 26 2022,positive,felt like continuous action brilliant film always on your feet with some spectacular action and stunts best one in the series for me felt like a really mature action film certainly more mature than some of the other mission impossible films
Jun 21 2022,positive,enjoy these   good series   if you like  waiting for the next one
Jun 19 2022,positive,long and filled with scenes of action unnecessary i eventually became bored right ridiculous at times a shame
Jun 16 2022,positive,by far the best in the series almost all action sequences were amazing to me the biggest improvement was with the music dont get me wrong the mission impossible theme is iconic but in my opinion its way to goofy this movie still utalizes parts of the theme but allowes itself to go for a bit more of an epic and serious tone which i really felt was lacking in previous installments i still have to redact half a point for a somewhat convoluted plot and one confusing action sequence
Jun 11 2022,positive,here again i find myself writing a review a few years late i remember going to see it in the cinema as soon as it was released powerful spectacular and entertaining this chapter in the mission impossible saga left me definitely satisfied it is full of action scenes that keep you in suspense the music and sound design are outstanding nothing to say great job i look forward to the sequel
Jun 10 2022,positive,amazing movie that had many twists and turns
Jun 9 2022,positive,its so good its so good its so good    it delivers on crazy stunts and adrenaline filled action scenes and on top of all that its also  kinda epic as in it ties in storylines and character threads introduced way back on mi3 and brings them all together for a huge emotional pay off at the end it kinda has this underlying sense of dread and somberness that starts at the opening scene and permeates thru the whole movie that really helps with the emotional pay off at the end too    also the best action scene in the whole movie is literally tom cruise running 
Jun 8 2022,positive,its hard not to think about how much cruise wants you to know hes doing all these stunts but resistance to its thrills is futile a thrilling action movie
Jun 4 2022,positive,mission impossible fallout is easily the best of the mission impossible franchise the stakes are always ridiculously high and the action sequences are intense and electrifying the foot chase in london is one of the best movie chases of all time if youre a fan of nonstop action thrills and plot twists this is the film for you so fresh
May 31 2022,positive,i still think this is one of the greatest action films ever made i dont know why the audience score is only 88
May 23 2022,positive,one of the best action films to ever grace the screen
May 5 2022,positive,this movie is amazing with great action great charactersand a great story i saw the trailer and i really wanted to see does and i have i happy i did watch it with my family this movie is awesome 810
Apr 28 2022,positive,sonic is a movie star but then its a movie star
Apr 25 2022,positive,how does a franchise seemingly improve on itself with every installment and where can you go once you get to the sixth movie in a franchise and create the perfect action movie i dont envy their task at following this up my favorite action movie hands down
Apr 10 2022,positive,theres a level of coolness and fun intrigue and mystery maturity and depth to fallout that other action films cant capture in addition to its jawdropping action sequences and perfect cast
Apr 7 2022,positive,out of all 6 mission impossible movies this is the best everything from the previous movies gets an upgrade the stunts are bigger the editing is great its easy to be cynical and nitpick the flaws of this movie but at the end of the day thats all just nitpicking the most important part of a movie is for it to be entertaining and this movie is very entertaining thats the reason i follow action movies because they are fun and entertaining and so is this movie the movie has some of the best action scenes of the past few years
Apr 7 2022,negative,the acting is soooo bad
Mar 27 2022,positive,holy moly  this is the type of film that keeps the action movie genre alive  standing ovation  cant wait for the next one
Mar 22 2022,positive,sensational they have improved everything in mission impossible ethan hunt offers everything from himself in this film to prevent his old enemy who threatens the world in an insane way and with better realistic and tense scenes
Mar 18 2022,positive,found the first three films ones that had a lot to like namely the action the visuals good casting on the whole and philip seymour hoffmanns superb villain in the third but also their faults plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third    ghost protocool to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original and actually better than it mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted rogue nation was on ghost protocools very high level sure there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic but rogue nation had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesnt feel like an issue    contrary to the critical consensus that mission impossiblefallout is the best mission impossible film personally dont quite agree it is definitely one of the best ones and perhaps third place behind ghost protocool and rogue nation my personal favourite    it does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots ving rhames is underused and doesnt seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role    some of the dialogue is also somewhat forced    visually mission impossiblefallout is even slicker and even more stylish than ghost protocool and rogue nation surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together the locations from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle the music doesnt overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound    the action is bigger bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments many are breathtaking in their excitement and also nuances hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm the motorcycle chase the helicopter battle the car chase the london sprints and the toilet martial arts fight christopher mcquarries directing is again some of the best hes ever done with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling    mission impossiblefallout script is generally sharp knowingly sophisticated with the humour not cheesy or out of place and intrigue superbly balanced the story the series heaviest darkest and most ambitious is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go with the backstories providing some depth there is like with rogue nation an appealing lightheartedness tongueincheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance as far as the mission impossible films go    tom cruise is very impressive handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma rebecca ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scenestealing with her in ersatz breathoffreshair form sean harris and henry cavill intimidate effectively while simon peggs comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and jeremy renners presence is more than welcome vanessa kirby alec baldwin and michelle monaghan are also strong it is a shame however that ving rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in rogue nation despite being underutilised in that too    on the whole very good just not amazing one of the better mission impossible films though and among the better films of the year if not among the very best 810 bethany cox
Mar 11 2022,positive,loved this movie definitely watching again non stop action and love the camera angles
Feb 6 2022,positive,i thought it was good overall action as per usual mi standards plus the storyline kept you guessing who was whos side for the mission we also get a closer look at ethan hawkes character and the important women in it
Feb 5 2022,positive,mission impossible fallout delivers on every level  compelling characters  masterful scenes  and fantastic action  now usually in action movies the action is the best part  in this movie what leads into the action is the best part  which i think gives fallout the advantage by quite a bit over its action movie counterparts the only thing i have a problem with is the excessive complexity  but then again thats in practically every spy movie nowadays  five stars best in the franchise and an absolute must see
Jan 18 2022,positive,the most adrenalinepumping mission movie to date with the best villain best action best score and best story in the series  everything about this movie is awesome and i cant think of any faults within it
Jan 17 2022,positive,mission impossible  fallout is yet another thrilling addition to the franchise that keeps tom cruise at the top of hollywoods list of highestpaid actors as expected the movie still offers breathtaking stunts and highrisk odds the deathdefying action sequences remain to be this franchises cup of tea and its apparent that cruise still does some of his own stunts it boggles my mind how some of the stunts and special effects were done im not sure if it was a good idea to cast henry cavill as a villain and im not really impressed about his acting here the movie is quite exhilarating but it can be a bit too long at 2 12 hours and storywise i think the previous mission impossible movies were better
Jan 9 2022,positive,for being the sixth installment of a movie franchise spanning over two decades i am surprised how well the stunts are designed it is impressive to hear tom cruise signed up for a fastpaced course to learn how to fly a helicopter so that he can fly one by himself in this movie
Jan 9 2022,positive,thrilling from first to last minute
Jan 8 2022,positive,i actually loved this movie more than anything i want to watch it again now that i think about it
Jan 3 2022,positive,better than my aunts soup which is good because i dont like soup
Dec 26 2021,positive,you thought it couldnt be anymore crazier after gps insane burj khalifa stunt but m i  f teams up with m i  rn to deliver another gunshot of insane action in a franchise that happens to be drunk on deathdefying stunts
Dec 11 2021,positive,a properly done action movie with actually enjoyable car chases and fight scenes i thought the action movie car chase was a lost art by now judging by the latest bond or bourne or similar movies but i was proven wrong and overall balance between realism and entertainment im not going to start watching a lot of other action movies now just because this one was actually good but i might give the next mi a chance if i see the same people are making it this is what a job well done looks like
Dec 3 2021,positive,i fucking love fallout i can do super hard work for school and for god i love god 9000  i love you tom cruise you masterpiece like me like my drawing and my movies all sonys  i love you guys really for real you pulled together like me like avengers spiderman   you merchandise like me you always my heart  i love you guys i love you fallout i love you god  i love you sony i love you1994200220042012
Nov 25 2021,positive,this movie is absolutely breathtaking  such a talented cast welldeveloped and realistic characters spectacular performances and such an amazing and emotional storyline with funny elements that really differentiate this action film from others the special effects and stunts are also so real  tom cruise even broke his ankle in midair for a stunt and continued the scene and learned to fly a helicopter for an aerobaticsstunt scene thats what i like to call dedication right there and it really lacks in most action movies so all i can say is this movie is not like others  it is absolutely incredible and i would give it 6 stars if i could i 100 recommend it
Nov 24 2021,positive,perhaps the best film of the entire series  the combat scenes are top notch
Nov 19 2021,positive,while many action flicks like these are filled with unrelenting fight scenes and no body to the characters fallout shows there is still hope for the future of the genre and firmly establishes a stunning entry into one of the best conceptualized franchises in the biz
Nov 14 2021,positive,just a great sequel to rogue nation does everything just a bit better
Nov 12 2021,positive,lots of action a seriously fast moving story great characters there is lots to like out this film my biggest problem who do you trust the plot twists with double crossing triple crossing quadruple crossing that did get tedious
Nov 6 2021,positive,not as good as mi1 but definitely the 2 best mi movie ever
Oct 23 2021,positive,my favorite of whole franchise mission impossible
Oct 13 2021,negative,ethan hunt is very lonely in this whole movie and very tired posh lane is now a crazy fanatic and the other villain is completely not memorable all scenes are absolutely boring except lanefergusson fight with poor little benji       rouge nation was 810 for me  elegant balanced enjoyable and cute  fallout  insane ugly monster
Oct 4 2021,positive,very cool action movie tom cruise is a go to if youre searching for some cool stuff recommend
Sep 27 2021,positive,reviewed 9321  this film recently appeared on a list of top 25 alltime action movies  and if action is simply what youre after mission accomplished  tom cruise continues his run of insane stunts this time jumping solo from 30000 feet  while the rest of the whiteknuckled action is spread throughout the everexpanding cast of mi characters    the most notable additions in this installment are vanessa kirby as a mysterious intermediary and henry cavill as a supposed cia hitmen that plays more like an alpha male meathead kirby adds to what was already a phenomenal female talent pool and for my money is the real reason to continue to give these movies a chance  kudos to cruise and the mi producers for helming a series that offers up female roles on par with their male counterparts  and within the storylines themselves its the femmes that truly rule this former boys club and the entire production is better for it    unfortunately the main storyline of a nuclear arsenal gone rouge falls flat  been there done that  after a slow start dominated by unnecessary mansplaining of the overly convoluted plot things eventually settle in  and they do mostly stick the landing with an ending that wisely returns to the emotional bond of the mi core
Sep 21 2021,positive,a very intense and exciting movie
Sep 2 2021,positive,one of the best in the movie series 810
Aug 31 2021,positive,a must watch movie it doesnt fail to give the proper entertainment the suspense in this flick is awesome tom cruise never disappoints and especially the jaw dropping stunts he does by himself hats off to him waiting for mi7
Aug 19 2021,positive,best installment of the franchise cruise gets better with age the stunts in this movie are breathtaking henry cavill was an awesome addition this is a movie you needed to see in theaters to experience it fully
Aug 11 2021,positive,i wanted to like it more than i did the twists were telegraphed which isnt necessarily a bad thing it just made the reveals somewhat anticlimactic the story was heavily reliant on having seen the previous films which i had but did not remember all that well so i was left trying to piece quite a bit together the action was good but went on for a little too long for my liking in some parts pacing would have been better if it had been about 20 minutes shorter i think but it was still entertaining and worth your time if you dont have anything else to watch
Aug 9 2021,positive,tom cruise isnt human
Jun 20 2021,positive,one of the best in this series
Jun 18 2021,positive,a tightly packed thrill ride and an engaging espionage film suffers a bit in the villain department but easily makes up for it in areas which count like the high energy chase scenes and emotional depth of the characters motivations the previous film was too slow for its own good this one moves so fast at times its hard to keep up really excited to see what mcquarrie comes up with for the next two entries 8510
Jun 14 2021,positive,currently the high water mark of the series phenomenal production values and immaculate direction make this one of the best action films of the 2010s
Jun 5 2021,negative,i have an irrational fear of heights most of the action scenes in this movie involve high places but my biggest criticism is that this movie is utter nonsense
May 31 2021,positive,if youve sought to avoid the mission impossible franchise or tom cruise himself this film offers is a safe opportunity to reconsider at this age and at this stage cruise brings a contagious onscreen effervescence and i say that as a guy who doesnt say effervescent much mcquarries plot and script are as tight as they are charming bringing drama and levity in apposite doses and of course i love any really good guy flick that i can enjoy with my wife and daughters
May 28 2021,positive,the best mission impossible movie and one of the best action movies fallout delivers on every category the action sequences are the best of the franchise and there are so many standouts like the halo jump bathroom fight paris chase rooftop chase and the helicopter chase each action scene is better than the previous and they build up in intensity every actor delivers excellent performances it was great seeing julia and ethans relationship developed its perfectly paced and structured and its a thrilling ride that leaves you on the edge of your seat even if its predictable the score is also absolutely phenomenal and truly carries a lot of scenes and mcquarrie really seemed to improve his directing its such a beautifully shot and edited movie you cant help but keep your eyes off it what a phenomenal movie in every way i dont know how theyll top this one
May 28 2021,positive,6310  okaywatchable    seen on 52721
May 26 2021,positive,the fact that parts of this movie are set in london made me think about this spybased action thrillfest next to the last few bond films it defecates on those films from such a great height that its embarrassing  better directing better action sequences better use of spectacular locations and a much much better scriptplot i dont know how the bond producers could watch this and not have a serious rethink its gloriously silly and highly entertaining probably the best action film of the 2010s
May 24 2021,positive,tom cruise at his best a true action movie star
May 4 2021,positive,full acton series tom crush always awesome
May 3 2021,positive,great choreography no shaky camera scenes and just an overall entertaining film to watch 
Apr 21 2021,positive,i was on the edge of my seat the whole movie so tense
Mar 30 2021,positive,the mission impossible films just keep getting better
Mar 23 2021,positive,wholly crap that was the best movie ever created amazing suspension and action
Mar 15 2021,positive,exciting captivating suspenseful and girl power this film had high expectations a huge budget lots of hype and it did not disappoint knowing that tom does his own stunts makes it that much cooler to watch i was on the edge of my seat for two and a half hours the plot twists and complicated storylines were captivating although i think henry cavills character development could have used some more work the music and sound effects were classic appropriate and added to the scene without being overwhelmingly loud or distracting  no small feat also i love the strong powerful badass women in this movie
Mar 15 2021,positive,this is a good one defitinitely recommend it if you are looking for action
Mar 15 2021,positive,scenes script plot and action of excellence he had never seen a great action movie like this nor an actor so brave and great to do scenes like the ones in this movie without a doubt the best action movie of the year or perhaps of the decade and to make something clear mission impossible is not worthy of the oscars the oscars are not worthy of the mission impossible saga
Mar 3 2021,positive,the best of the mission impossible franchise it contains thrilling music great villains and is a splendid continuation from the previous film
Mar 3 2021,positive,one of the best directed action movies in recent years certainly one of the best in this decade usually sequels get worse and worse mission impossible is the one of few movies i can think of that gets better and better with each part its almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh interestingly the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the director team remained the same the last three are very good and this one is probably the best in terms of quality an interesting story that requires attention tense action scenes that are at the highest level i must also mention tom cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various stunts shooting driving racing jumping parkour flying the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes which is not a small amount for an action film one of the most appreciated things about cruise is that what he does onscreen is real he really does those leaps between buildings he broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks he really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic he really does fly a helicopter who knows what motivates this guy but the results are incredible the music the stunts the actors the cities and the landscapes everything was put together amazingly well and an ending scene that you will never forget and some people may find the plot quite complicated and it is you really need to pay attention i recommend watching mi5 and if you have time all the others there is a reference to all of them along with the movie
Feb 28 2021,positive,i just think that this one movie didnt bring anything new to the franchise they repeated the same nice tools that made the mi so famous this one specially comes with a dark side narrative but nothing else to add
Feb 23 2021,positive,entertaining but silly  the rest of the family hated it and wont watch another mi movie
Feb 23 2021,negative,a long and tedious film with cardboard cut out characters and a tom and jerry style plot
Feb 17 2021,positive,i liked this movie a lot but it is not a 1010 masterpiece it is a fun thrilling action movie that is what it is nothing more nothing less
Feb 15 2021,positive,its the ultimate action movie
Feb 14 2021,positive,the franchise shows no signs of slowing down its a typical intricate mi plot with narrative threads going back to rogue nation goosed with spectacular fights and chases 
Jan 28 2021,positive,this franchise has no right to be so consistently incredible
Jan 25 2021,positive,mission impossible fallout does an absolute perfect job of everything it tries in the film the acting is superb the stunts are incredible the set pieces are intriguing the action is nighon perfect but it isnt very original there is a very stale nuclear bomb plot that weve seen over and over in movies the plot feels like an updated version of the past 5 mission impossible movies entirely new but still sticking so close to the formula that it makes this epic modern movie feel stale and overdone
Jan 10 2021,positive,great movie must see it a lot of action
Jan 8 2021,positive,i had not seen a mission impossible movie before seeing this movie this was a awesome movie gives you what you would would expect  a fun action blockbuster with some of the best action ive seen in a movie tom cruise is great  as was all of the cast the stunts and set pieces in this movie were amazing christopher mcquarrie done a great job writing and directing this movie the score by lorne balfe was great especially  the exchange this movie is a great time looking forward to the next movies they do in this franchise hopefully they can be at the same level as this one
Jan 3 2021,positive,the mission impossible franchise in general always has visually stunning intense action sequences and stunts in store for us viewers but none of them have ever been quite like this tom cruises ethan hunt continues to blow our socks off with a powerful performance thats really gripping  this is possibly one of the best action movies of all time rebecca fergusons ilsa faust was a little over the top and wooden in the previous instalment of the franchise rogue nation  her first debut but she was a lot better in fallout in terms of acting great movie the best one in the franchise so far cant wait for mi7 and 8  
Dec 29 2020,positive,easily the best mission impossible it has fantastic and consistent action with great stunts that tom cruise actually performed huge surprise there  9810
Dec 20 2020,negative,i love these people the best mission impossible yet its easy to be the best if the target to beat is not that high take this plot a man and his friends must stop a nuclear bomb and it comes down to him fighting for the denotator  from 1980 until today there is at least 40 movies with this exact same plot absolutely no originality at all listen i like the cast but there was one person missing from the cast that every movie like this or a bond movie has and thats the super hot spy either she is good or evil but in this film the ladies are pretty but none are a bond girl if you are going to take a lame plot like this you need the hot girl you need weapons that we have never seen before the mask thing is great but was under used in the one scene they used it and tricked the guy that was good the audience should not know whats going to happen before it does and they did in this movie except for that you want more of that you want them going i did not see that coming the car chase and to long and lost the audience they got bored you need a wow factor for a chase to work today i am not talking about crazy jumps etc for comic relief have a pet grooming truck open in the back and he drives in or pull into a strip joint and the strippers open a secret basement they all would be better than these guys going 120 crashing the car and getting out and fighting a half a dozen guys you want the audience to believe this could happen no one believes in these chases two helicopters go down and both guys in separate helicopters live come on you new the moment they said the word detonator there was going to be a fight and he would stop it at the last minute there was no suspense like i said you have seen this plot dozens of times before even with the technology we have today they could have made this exact movie in 1980 and it would have looked the same to recap if you have no life like the guys who said this was the best then this movie is for you if you want action suspense hot women new gadgets and a brand new plot then this is not the movie for you honestly why do all these movies have to be a bomb or a chemical weapon  has anyone had a new idea in the last half a century  you have a blank page you could have anything going on and they always fall back to these tired plots listen i love the cast they are great actors but no matter how good you are you cant take a plot that has been done a hundred times and make it seem new if your being honest you saw everything coming before it even happened yes even the guy betraying him that was their wow factor for this movie i could have paused it and said what was going to happen from the beginning to the end every 10 to 15 minute and i would have been exactly right every time i know a lot of you new what the plot was and new half way thru what was going to happen you new when they said they need the detonators he would have to fight him and with a second left turn it off i dare you to tell me you didnt you know what i would have done i would have let it blown up and then had ethans twin brother come back in the next movie for revenge you could have had some of the original cast not in the bomb radius but yes you would have to kill off a couple characters you know why  no one would see it coming yes i am not saying do that exactly i am saying make a movie that is original or if you are going to take one of these over used plots totally change it put your spin on it make it so the audience has not got a clue whats going on let me rephrase that you want them to follow the story but every time they think this is going to happen something else happens keeping them on the edge of their seat the only good thing about this movie if you had to go to the bathroom you didnt have any problem catching up to the plot i meant no offense to the actors or the people who liked it i liked this movie 40 years ago i just wanted something new
Dec 19 2020,negative,lets see this is suppose to be like the bond movies except no fancy weapons no super hot good or evil women no realistic plot and chase scenes lets be honest about chase scenes i dont care if its a car a motor cycle a boat a helicopter etc they are all to long instead of building of the action they end up boring the majority of the audience just once i would like to see a realistic crash all of them are so out there no one believes they would survive let alone walk out and 9 times out of ten get in a fist fight  the whole point is to make the audience believe this is real when a guy crashes two helicopters and both survive never going to happen in real life a guy crashes a car going 120 miles and hour he is not getting out with a few scratches and fighting a half a dozen people anytime i see this type of stuff i know they are trying to make up for bad writing my bottom line is if your bored this movie is a bleah something to watch oh the other thing that has been done to many times its time to come up with something new the timer is going off there is under 5 minutes left on the timer and of course there is a fist fight and the actual time for the fight is longer than the time that was on the timer and of course they always get the timer and turn it off honestly you could take the plot of this movie punch it into google and dozens of films will come up with the exact same plot and outcome there is no originality to recap dont expect a bond movie no original plot no super hot women no exciting and crazy hand guns and other weapons nope this movie could have been made in 1980 and they would have to change nothing
Dec 19 2020,positive,although i wanted an explosion at the end of the film hahaha the film is incredible it was my first contact with mission impossible and i loved it
Dec 15 2020,positive,ive never like the mission impossible series as much as bond or borne but i do sort of like this type of movie i think the previous one was extremely good this one seemed kind of bland by comparison a lot of the action scenes seemed like repeats of things that have been done many times before and the ending scenes especially seemed a bit forced to create extra drama some of the characters that seemed quirky or engaging in the previous movie were a bit more bland in this one in this story the team is supposed to get some rogue plutonium when it is stolen from under their noses they spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back the plot is a bit confusing and implausible at times to the point that you dont end up getting very invested in everything that is going on towards the end there is an odd addition of a storyline about a love interest from ethans past that seems a bit tacked on overall this edition of mission impossible is not as engaging as some of the others have been it is enough to be entertaining for a couple hours of viewing but it probably will not be considered a classic
Dec 8 2020,positive,best action movie ever hands down
Dec 8 2020,positive,incredible film with excellent action scenes and a wellresolved script has many breathtaking scenes and is a great spy and action film tom cruises performance remains impeccable the villain is very interesting the twists are cool the films mood is also good everything is very well done and accurate
Dec 7 2020,positive,this is the best action movie that has ever been made and that is a factual statement
Dec 6 2020,positive,i dont know how but this franchise gets better with every installmenttom cruise is brilliant as always this movie has very little flaws it can be watched multiple times without it being boredthis is just fantastic go watch it
Dec 4 2020,negative,tom cruise in his 30s as the lead in imf yeah every time  cruise in his mid 50s no way  unbelievable  you know that word that you exclaim when you see something exciting out of this world and really cool  that is what the imf television show was coming on the heels of the great bond movies  but never did i think that a movie producer would make an action film that was terrible and unbelievable because the stars looked so out of place trying to look like tough guys in a fight or pull off youthful athletic moves when they were way past their prime  and in a nut shell that is what ruined the movie  i kept watching though hoping the story which really wasnt that bad would pull it out in the end  the ending   unbelievable  and you can guess about which meaning of the word i am forced to use
Nov 20 2020,positive,the best mi movie of all time
Nov 15 2020,positive,a movie you never want to end absolutely amazing
Nov 13 2020,positive,tom cruise is an amazing actor it as well shows in this movie it surprises me how hes not dead yet the stunts are insane
Nov 2 2020,positive,it is completely mindblowing 1010
Oct 30 2020,positive,the best mission impossible movie out of the franchise for sure rogue nation was amazing too  its just for me this movie is just a bit better
Oct 27 2020,positive,henry cavill did a great job as a villain love it  rebecca ferguson is so stunning and such a good actress
Oct 21 2020,positive,surprising to see that mi doesnt seem like its trying to further the franchise just to make money this movie contained some of the best mission impossible action of the whole series surprisingly good story and characters too after this many movies
Oct 20 2020,positive,its a solid addition to the mi series not the best but still pretty good
Oct 12 2020,positive,i recently watched the 2 latest offerings in the mission impossible franchise and for me at least i think rogue nation is the superior movie its not by much but fallout feels a little predictable even by the low standards of popcorn fare like this  from the opening halo jump there are certain scenes which feel heavily edited as they seem to have parts of dialogue missing characters suddenly become adversarial with zero build up wooden expressions on actors faces appear as if theyre reacting to something we havent seenheard and so on i hadnt realised how bad an actor tom cruise can be until i watched these movies hes very charming and charismatic and does action well enough but he cant sell drama or emotion to save his frequently in peril life there are also new characters introduced who simply dilute things and add nothing the story would work better without them and it feels like a clumsy attempt to interject characters simply so they could be used in future movies  as for the storyline its convoluted yet somehow predictably simple fallout is best viewed with rogue nation fresh in your mind as they do try to connect a lot of story threads  and it feels like a continuation of rns story not simply a standalone movie so people who havent seen rn wont appreciate a good portion of character motivations and where the big threat has come from the villain of the movie is very underserved and comes off as more bland than threatening though that may be more to do with how much screen time hes given which is surprisingly little considering how big of a villain hes supposed to be by the end were seemingly left to assume the good guys have won but you get the impression that the big threat the syndicate would surely carry on as any time theyre mentioned we see a screen full of at least 50 rogue agents yet by this movies end weve met less of them than you can count on one hand and as for the twist of who the traitor might be well its as telegraphed as it could possibly be theres really only one choice of who it could be right from the start so as soon as you make your guess youre almost guaranteed to be right because nobody believes its ever actually going to be ultimate good guy ethan do they  the stunt work is as impressive as ever but it gets a little tired the helicopter chase at the end outstayed its welcome for me and i thought it would have been betterserved to be shorter than it was with so many tense set pieces its easy to overplay that hand which this movie does perhaps some clever gadgets used in some situations would be an entertaining diversion from the bull in a china shop approach of trying to oneup themselves with every big set piece    im definitely on board for the next movie as these feel like golden era james bond movies made today they wisely dont move too far into the gritty realism that the bourne identity injected into these spy actionthrillers and rely more on bouncy interactions big action set pieces and banter suspension of disbelief is paramount when watching these movies but rated for what they are theyre entertaining distractions and isnt that their purpose dont expect much and they probably wont disappoint you
Oct 12 2020,positive,nice sharing its awesome one keep posting 
Oct 8 2020,positive,it is a wonderful intertainment movie no debut it is the best mission impossible movie so far i loved everything
Oct 7 2020,positive,you can take a whole seat but youll only need the edge
Oct 6 2020,positive,toptier action that qualifies this as a instant classic
Oct 1 2020,positive,exhilirating and fun
Sep 30 2020,positive,even if you enjoy action movies from time to time you just skip that one
Sep 26 2020,positive,almost a perfect action movie you think you know what is coming next but each action sequence is more impossible than the next cant wait for mi7
Sep 24 2020,positive,the action is spectacular the plot is fun and it made me want more
Sep 24 2020,positive,it was worth the superman mustache fiasco to have cavill here exciting pacy and cohesive with some of toms best gratuitous running to date although i find myself looking forward to the day we get surprised by there actually not being an inside traitor in a mission impossible film
Sep 23 2020,positive,mission impossible fallout is one of the greatest action movies ever made amazing stunt workmostly from tom cruise stunning locations and a good way to respect the characters we love
Sep 19 2020,positive,a respectable addition to the franchise
Sep 15 2020,positive,really good sequel continues the spy franchise
Sep 11 2020,positive,against all odds it exceeds expectations and becomes the best of the franchise and pays homage to its predecessors while being fresh and consistent in its plot with skillful direction great performances from tom cruise and henry cavill stunning visuals effects and some of the best action sequences in the genre
Sep 7 2020,negative,about 4000 twists that make it impossible to watch or enjoy wife and i looked at each other and said this is garbage didnt even finish it
Aug 30 2020,positive,what did i think of mission impossible fallout check out my full review below  
Aug 30 2020,positive,great fantastic phenomenal action movie starring tom cruise simon pegg henry cavill and the rest of the mission impossible gang this movie is action packed  the most action packed mission impossible movie to date this is the best mission impossible movie since ghost protocol henry cavill was the best and his mustache was phenomenal i finally like henry cavill and justice league sucks because of him and i forgive him now
Aug 26 2020,positive,to say the set pieces are outstanding especially for a series known for them really doesnt give the film justice or mcquarrie every fistfight carmotorcycle chase halo jump helicopter duel is expertly shot framed it almost becomes nauseating how fastpaced and thrilling fallout really is with each sequence outdoing the previous scene theres a wonderful mix of both practical and special effects which flow so seamlessly even the most eagleeyed cinephile will struggle to spot a green screen not only is it exasperatingly exciting fallout is a beautiful film thanks to the masterful cinematography from rob hardy whose work was equally impressive with annihilation im sure plenty of shots in this film will make for great desktop backgrounds
Aug 25 2020,positive,normally i hate cash grab revivals but the revival of the mission impossible series has been creative and exciting i attribute this to the stellar cast surrounding cruise they adds to the personality the basic story structure is always the same but the ride there is as exciting as ever
Aug 25 2020,positive,such an action packed movie
Aug 20 2020,positive,a mustwatch movie for tom cruise fans
Aug 20 2020,positive,this was a great movie simple as that non stop action and an incredible bathroom fight scene    edit after watching all the mission impossibles minus mission impossible 2 i could only get through 20 mins of that garbage i would say this is the best one an example of a great action movie no more no less
Aug 19 2020,positive,one of the best action movies of the last ten years incredibly slick and stylish almost perfect pacing and it somehow manages to not take itself too seriously even with the insanity of the action sequences a little long on the run time is my only minor complaint
Aug 19 2020,positive,this is my favourite film ever it has brilliant action and awesome stunts the acting is splendid and everyone gives it their all and the humour is also very good the entire film is exhilarating and awesome this is one of the best  if not the best  action movies of all time
Aug 19 2020,positive,2 scenes in the is whole movie make it stand out over all the rest good installment into the franchise not 97 good but still good 4 stars because of the halo jump scene and the helicopter set piece
Aug 16 2020,positive,a really enjoyable compelling film just like the last two in the franchise
Aug 8 2020,positive,when i watched the trailer i hadnt seen any one of the movies prior yet i still desperately wanted to watch it so i bought all the movies prior and watched them and boy when i watched the 6th it was all worth it the best movie of the summer by far
Aug 7 2020,positive,the best mission impossible yet
Aug 6 2020,positive,love the action special effects and acting  great story too
Aug 5 2020,positive,amazing stunts captivating storyline
Aug 4 2020,positive,it had been years since i had seen an action movie so good this movie surpasses mission 1 impossible by far  we have some spectacular action scenes like christopher mcquarrie takes the chases and also the fights  tom cruise is risking his life here since apparently he shot many of the risky scenes that is this gentleman is to have a pair well put gentlemen  it has a spectacular cast everyone plays a good role a soundtrack that makes your hair stand on end and a tension during the incredible film i had to sigh many times during the film because i was nervous i insist a spectacular direction  an incredible role of tom cruise is that it is not the same role as we always see an ethan hunt with feelings who is not a typical hero but an authentic hero who would die for his companions and for saving the world  an incredible henry cavill as you can see he knows how to fight  a very good story with very good twists  some very good visual effects cgi is never abused and a spectacular bad one too
Aug 3 2020,positive,mission impossible fallout is a very entertaining movie for the franchise   my grade b
Aug 3 2020,positive,my favourite in the franchise since the original every action sequence delivers and the plot is a good one
Aug 3 2020,positive,love it on my birthday great movie
Jul 23 2020,positive,not bad was a little longer than id like but it fulfills my mission impossible appetite
Jul 15 2020,positive,despite his age cruise continues to deliver satisfying actionpacked thrillers in this established franchise with a welldeveloped character we have learned to appreciate and understand decades after the first installment

Jun 28 2020,positive,the best of the franchise so far
Jun 27 2020,positive,the mission is to stop plutonium from reaching someone who wants to make a bomb out of it lot of action
Jun 18 2020,positive,best action movie of all time
Jun 18 2020,positive,absolutely one of the best mission impossible movies to date definitely more action heavy than other mi movies henry cavils mustache and the mustache gate it caused for his superman role is a bit ridiculous i dont understand why he couldnt shave his mustache and regrow it
Jun 13 2020,positive,its great and the best in the franchise action is terrific tom cruise and henry civil is awesomerebecca ferguson is still bad assving rhames and simon pegg is great comic relief overall one of the best action movies ever made
Jun 6 2020,positive,good movie good actors good script the only weak things i think are dialogues and vfx but that doesnt mean you need to decrease other points they are great
Jun 6 2020,positive,probably the most well paced and fun action film i have ever seen
Jun 3 2020,positive,i love this movie i think its the best mission impossible movie it seems like these movies get better and better i loved every second of it the acting the action the tension the chemistry between everyone involved just an overall amazing movie the only negative is its kinda predictable and there is a scene where they really tip their hand and tell you who the bad guy is but i was very entertained by this movie i was never bored and thats the best when you watch a movie or anything and you arent bored
Jun 3 2020,positive,one of the better mi films ferguson  continues to be the standout at least for me the story is interesting but the twists are predictable
May 28 2020,neutral,started great with premise and characters great action that is somewhat believable in this time and age  but easily predictable with an extraordinary ending like the fast and furious movies one of the best if not the best mi movies until the 3rd act where i mean you have to see it for yourself spoiler alert ending villains are awful dont finish the job in which they so believe in love the movie was believing it was the best one until last 45 min
May 26 2020,positive,a really good action movie never failed to entertain during the 2 hour and 30 minutes of the movie one thing i think they should have done is made it shorter because there are many moments in the movie that i feel shouldnt have been in the movie
May 26 2020,positive,a really good action movie with moments that will give you an adrenaline rush the only bad part of the movie was that it could have been much shorter
May 19 2020,positive,my favorite mission impossible movie and one of my favorite action films the stunts and set pieces are great
May 19 2020,positive,one of the best movies i saw in the last 2 years
May 18 2020,positive,fantastic follow up to rogue nation an entry that feels like a sequel to the following film incredible stunts and set pieces every scene itll be tough to match this 
May 18 2020,positive,the best mission yet and the best action movie of 2018 dont miss out on this fun movie
May 9 2020,positive,action scenes are top notch but theres no excuse for a film in this massmarketed genre to be confusing  not that it really matters i guess
May 9 2020,positive,i live here in new zealand were the last sean was done i always tend to forget how beautiful this country is that i live in 100best place ever lighters up
May 8 2020,positive,one of the best action movies ever
Apr 28 2020,negative,tom cruise is just stunning but besides him the movie had many cliches of the genre and it was a little overlong for me
Apr 21 2020,positive,great stunts by tom cruse great scenes lots of drama would recommend it    grade  a
Apr 16 2020,negative,three nuclear devices are in the hands of bad guys so the us government sends four individuals with masks to go and retrieve them right
Apr 12 2020,positive,solid sequel in this hit franchise the expectations were pretty low as people wondered what could be left for this series but the answer came in pretty strongly with a good plot execution and cast fast and thrilling
Apr 5 2020,positive,clear understandable and a total blast with its pace scenes characters and interstingshocking twists that are the best among others in mission impossible franchise this movie is one of the best action movies of all time
Apr 5 2020,positive,i think this is a pretty relaxing full action movies we know how it will end but the conflict inside this movie makes the whole stories special
Apr 3 2020,positive,an improvement on the previous installment in the franchise and much more in line with the spirit of the original series  great set action scenes the are melded well together in a compelling story
Mar 31 2020,positive,very good film the action scenes are beyond the conventional
Mar 30 2020,positive,mission impossible  fallout leaves audiences mouthgaped once again with its intense brilliantly directed action scenes stellar performances from cruise and cavill  and eyepopping visuals
Mar 29 2020,negative,some of the absolute worse dialog i have ever heard  lazy and contrived not believable for a second  little kids will like it
Mar 29 2020,positive,arguably a step down from the preceding ghost protocol and rogue nation fallout is rather overlong and stuffed with double triple quadruple twists and cliched plot devices and would have benefited from some more humour and wittier dialogue nevertheless it continues the tradition of spectacular action in grand fashion with excellent stunts several breathtaking sequences wonderful locales and of course the ageless tom cruise
Mar 27 2020,positive,its knowing how much time and effort was put in to the practical stunts that gives fallout added mustsee appeal if the mission was to create an intense thrillride of a simmer blockbuster consider this mission accomplished
Mar 24 2020,negative,if you are a person that just wants the mostrecent action movie then thats about the full audience this movie will deserve it is a highbudget fastpaced dumpster fire there are many reasons but id say that the 1 reason is the juvenile story tom cruise did a great job and most of the acting was ok but it is so cliche so generic so recycled so predictable and boring in the worst way it reminds me of a bad tv show that wants to be the coolhip dude at the party it is badly paced and everything but the kitchen sink was thrown into this film if this is the first film youve ever seen you might like it but never love it   the worst thing about this movie is that everybody walks around in this actionhero daze and it is ridiculous running around without masks having no backup going in with 3 guys and a fancy briefcase do not justify great story and action it also tried to copy the terrible scene in batman when all the cops got stuck in the sewers and didnt even try to get out awful  this movie was a decade late and a dollar too much it tried to be edgy and nextgen but failed badly if you want an excellent movie watch mi4 ghost protocol but if you get this for free and you have some beers and friends over it is worth a few laughs
Mar 24 2020,positive,mission impossible  fallout ignores all pretense that this franchise exists for any other reason than to watch tom cruise do insane stunts on screen  the plot is the most convoluted and nonsensical yet but the action sequences practical stunt work and sense of suspense is the highest its ever been  christopher mcquarrie is the first to return to the directors chair for a mission impossible movie and for good reason hes made two of the best films in the franchise
Mar 15 2020,negative,fine action terrible lines  should be called mission impossible im sorry for the number of times that tom cruises character needlessly apologizes to different characters
Mar 14 2020,positive,great movie probably the best mission impossible yet lots of action gave me a nice darn adrenaline rush great spy movie to watch with family youre gonna love it
Mar 13 2020,positive,this recent mission impossible movie was very good it was just as great as the ghost protocol and rogue nation tom cruise is back as ethan hunt and he continues to be an awesome imf agent simon pegg ving rhames henry cavill and the rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this movie as well the plot to the movie was pretty intense and thrilling throughout in addition the action and fight scenes were really cool check out this movie sometime if you havent yet youll love it
Mar 11 2020,positive,man is this movie tense im afraid of heights and there were many moments when my palms were sweaty watching the characters in helicopters planes and high buildings the car chase scenes in paris are very good the script as with most mission impossible movies is a bit complex and hard to follow at times one characters storyline is forgotten about and then reintroduced at the end of the movie but this movie is a lot of fun
Mar 5 2020,positive,mission impossible fallout is a very fun and complex action film however said complexity mixed with a breakneck pace makes it a film which requires your utmost attention and more dont blink
Mar 5 2020,positive,great fun entertainment and a good dose of wholesomeness to boot
Mar 1 2020,negative,same boring car chases helicopter chases people wearing masks who turn out someone else berlin paris london as though there were no other places in the world improbable situations boring boring boring
Feb 27 2020,positive,movies this far along in a franchise with a 55year old star dont deserve to be this good yet here we are 455
Feb 17 2020,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time but stillonly 2nd best of the mi franchise
Feb 16 2020,negative,im afraid its so boring
Feb 12 2020,positive,the best thing i can say about this film is that watching it this time was exactly the same as when i saw it in the cinema which is to say it is every bit as excellent it is the quintessential action blockbuster of these few years it is the pinnacle of the franchise gripping brisk accessible and clever everything in my previous review stands verbatim this is an excellently entertaining flick with everything firing in all cylinders against all odds   it is a better film in every way than its predecessor it carries its own unique voice despite being the same director as the last film an action blockbuster is inherently flawed and so it must mask its flaws and perform greater smarter feats to obfuscate and override its flaws and like the dark knight before it fallout manages to do so  its running in clean renewable creativity   impossible mission you want me to say the halo jump but while i find its addition into the picture to be pleasingly and shockingly sudden the use of a cgi backdrop storm downplays the reality of it for me fallout may be the first in the franchise to have such forward momentum thrust and its own blistering finale to catch up to that it forgoes the trope of the big central mission at a push id say the finale is exercised like a team mission with everybody doing their part a welcome addition of monaghans julia and imax footage of cavill shooting a lmg at tom cruise flying a helicopter for real it saved the best till last   roll on mission impossible 7 and   an additional shoutout is needed for lorne balfe who managed to create an evocative and memorable score using the bongos from the first film with a brilliant epic update to the theme and like david arnolds work in casino royale also creates a new exciting theme hopefully for all the rest of mission   and in regards to the editing of the imax ratio shifts into the movie i only noticed twice towards the end of the movie and couldnt believe how seamless and effective it was when compared to the eyesplitting nausea of something like the latest transformers
Feb 10 2020,positive,yet another surprisingly phenomenal action film cruise is very much still up to the task and the action set pieces continue to deliver the goods a
Feb 5 2020,positive,i was disappointed by it after rogue nation 2018   toms new chopperflying skills were impressive
Feb 5 2020,positive,absolutely thrilling action scenes great acting and overall great film
Feb 3 2020,positive,great action sequences but the story was a bit much
Jan 28 2020,positive,another stellar installment in the mission impossible franchise the whole cast is back and continue to work well together including the addition of cavill the movie boasts incredible landscapes and some exceptional cinematography that spans across multiple continents but the best part of fallout is the action a multitude of thrilling and diverse action set pieces are perfectly placed throughout the long run time that add humour tension and thrills to this great flick
Jan 19 2020,positive,if you say its the best action movie ever made and greatest of all times then you are absolutely true mindboggling real stunts freaking best performance by tom  crew takes you to an awestruck level      just wow  wow 1010
Jan 18 2020,negative,one of the worst movies so looking forward to seeing it afterall the others have been excellent this was so poor tom must have been having one helluva bad time to release this
Jan 15 2020,positive,one of the best if not the best action movie of all time tom cruise is great  the rest of the cast shines as well the story is great stunts are surreal
Jan 9 2020,positive,pretty good great action 
Jan 7 2020,positive,the pracitcal action up close shots and actors doing thier own stunt work make this movie pretty epic great direction tom and the rest of the cast are good as usual the writting is full pf twist and turns just as you would expect i really enjoyed this movie is my favorite of the mission films
Jan 6 2020,positive,the best mission impossible to date there was plenty of action backed by solid plot although henry cavill was a bit obvious as the villain the plot flowed reasonably seamlessly from scene to scene the action sequences were wellchoreographed for the most part and tom cruise performed with aplomb bringing back ethan hunts wife was a nice touch one of the best action movies i have seen
Jan 4 2020,positive,this is such an amazing movie the actionstunt sequences are something else there is a heightened sense of suspense and danger as you can see that the stunts were performed for real by the actors tom cruise and the gang are obviously great but to me vanessa kirby and henry cavill stand out the score is also fantastic
Jan 4 2020,positive,recently binge watched the mi series and have to say fallout is really bad mi movie and it showsactors feel old and tired the movie is more a follow up movie and fan service then a good spyaction movie  same as with bourne series after ultimatum it just goes downhill  its a watchable 3 star movie with great stunt work but they should probably reboot the franchise now
Jan 3 2020,positive,tom cruise has done it yet again with this fresh new film form the makers of the mission impossible franchise it delivers entertainment as well as scene where you will find yourself at the edge of your seat the acting from the whole cast is spectacular especially henry cavil
Jan 2 2020,positive,awesome movie great action
Jan 1 2020,positive,this movie is the perfect action movie a great story magnificent soundtrack epic stunts and set pieces and non stop action it has two of the best actors around in tom cruise and henry cavil with a superb supporting cast ive seen this film 11 times since its release and the most recent was just as enjoyable as the first a must watch movie
Jan 1 2020,positive,pretty silly
Dec 29 2019,positive,fantastic  one of better movies put out in years cavil is one of premier actors around haven t found a movie of his havent loved yet
Dec 29 2019,positive,i did not think mission impossible was a big deal but then i saw fallout and it is amazing it is the best in the franchise the action is incredible every scene feels entertaining and suspenseful
Dec 27 2019,positive,tom cruise owns it in this film
Dec 26 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout is the best of the series and is a very solid and entertaining action movie  tom cruise is always good in the mission impossible series even if the movie around him is not however one of the best parts of the movie is henry cavill as walker he has great charisma and is awesome in action scenes  mission impossible fallout has thrilling action is hugely entertaining and leaves me wanting the next film in the series to be just as good as this one
Dec 25 2019,positive,these never get old liked it action movie goodness
Dec 20 2019,positive,a mustsee film for action movielovers easily one of the best directed and executed action films of the decade
Dec 19 2019,positive,tom still got it good action movie with great acting and nice plot twist
Dec 19 2019,negative,tom cruise is a terrible actor
Dec 14 2019,neutral,it would be okay if it were the first  but theres really nothing new in it and the helicopter scene is so far fetched nobody would ever survive crashes like that and that two people do at the same time and are able not only to walk away but have a fistfight its frankly laughable
Dec 14 2019,positive,i was absolutely riveted by how gorgeously shot this movie is and how the action sequences top everything else seen before even the burj khalifa stunt in ghost protocol doesnt compare to this one this movie is already my favorite of the franchise tom cruise what can i say about the man he is unbeatable in the stunt department and he gives a really dedicated performance as well i loved seeing him reunite with julia and moving on from what happened to her i can really feel the struggle inside of him and thought that this outing as ethan hunt was perhaps the best of the series ving rhames is funny and still has that great fatherlike relationship with ethan that is so heartwarming to experience simon pegg gives a great performance as always he is really committed to being benji and clearly wants to stay on the team i love pegg so much and think that he is very underrated as an actor and i definitely prefer him in this then in star trek not that he was bad in it he is just so incredibly good in this rebecca ferguson was great once again but i felt that she was a bit better in rogue nation she doesnt get quite as much to do this time around but it was nice to see her return michelle monaghan had a most welcome return that felt necessary to ethans progression as a character she is probably done with the series so it was nice to see her character arc that was started excellently in miiii finished in a satisfying way alec baldwin was also great to see return though his role was significantly reduced and ultimately terminated i thought that his sacrifice felt earned and it contributed to the plot pretty well i couldnt ask for anything more from baldwins character he was about as good as he could have possibly been im just sad to see him leave so soon sean harris returns as the main villain of this movie and he is super good i liked him in rogue nation but he was so much more present and developed in this film i definitely didnt mind seeing him return and enjoyed seeing him in a couple great action sequences as well henry cavill is underrated in my opinion and he gives a great performance here for the first half of the film he basically fills in the gap that was left with jeremy renners absence but then in the second half he becomes sean harriss righthand man i really bought into him as a villain and thought that he was really very physically imposing he did a great job with what he had to work with vanessa kirby was the disposable character of this movie i really didnt see the point of her character when her brother basically did everything for her angela bassett was basically laurence fishburne from miiii she is in this movie for maybe 10 minutes but she wasnt bad the plot of this movie is great but the inbetween parts get very confusing dont get me wrong christopher mcquarrie wrote an excellent script but it got confusing when multiple people all betray someone differently i legitimately got confused for a couple of minutes but it worked itself out by the end it is still the best script in the series and i love how emotional it ties in with the characters it was just complex and thoughtprovoking like the first film but in an amazing way that challenges the audience the helicopter chase sequence is the staple of the entire franchise i was so invested and excited by literally every second it was happening the camera angles were all perfect the music added to the intensity of the situation and the minigun that henry cavill uses is so epic i wanted it to never end this is one of those super rare gems that tops what you thought could never be topped in terms of action sequences stunts and a great sense of teamwork this probably my favorite team out of all of the movies they whittled it down to only the very best and i hope to see them in the next two movies as well the subplots could use a little more polishing and vanessa kirbys character couldve been scrapped but other than that i was blown away by what this movie has achieved this movie moved fast and slow and it achieved that balance of perfect pace that is so rare to see nowadays and it is accompanied by a super compelling script and mindblowing action sequences both helmed masterfully by christopher mcquarrie this also has the best third act in any action movie ever it is genuinely intense and also immensely entertaining it leaves an amazing taste in your mouth for a while after it ends this will be hard to ever top but i have been proven wrong in that department before even just within this series i only hope that i will be proven wrong again
Dec 13 2019,positive,as usual mi continues to thrill and keep me on the edge of my seat
Dec 12 2019,positive,one of the best of the imf series

Nov 18 2019,positive,though im not a huge fan of pg13 action films i truly love this movie the action is fast paced and entertaining in classic mission impossible style the cinematography in it was especially amazing and tom cruise gives it his all in this one as well this edge of your seat movie is one of my favorite action movies of all time and i totally recommend
Nov 9 2019,positive,one of the best action films ever made with some of the greatest stunt work ever
Nov 9 2019,positive,its knowing how much time and effort was put in to the practical stunts that gives fallout added mustsee appeal if the mission was to create an intense thrill ride of a simmer blockbuster consider this mission accomplished
Nov 8 2019,positive,possibly the best of this franchise amazing action and stunts complex plot wonderful characters plus humor fantastic driving music and more one of the additional things i particularly enjoyed were the various homages to the original tv series updated for todays movie technology
Nov 6 2019,positive,still manage to still create interesting entertaining and fast moving stories
Nov 1 2019,positive,undoubtedly the best installment in the series a smashing cast flies alongside tom cruise as he once again shows his creativity for stunts and of course brilliant action and chase sequences

Oct 16 2019,positive,just fantastic  best movie in the year  
Oct 14 2019,positive,i cant believe im saying this but mission impossible is turning out to be one of the most entertaining and reliable action franchises of alltime ever since mission impossible 3 these films just keep getting better and better theyve even done the impossible by turning me into a tom cruise fan i never liked the guy even in his 80s prime but seeing how far he pushes himself with the stunts in these movies is part of what makes them work so well in a time when the action genre is filled with nothing but cgi and green screen seeing cruise go full jackie chan for these films deserves some admiration the icing on the cake is that were once again treated to a smart script great supporting cast plenty of surprises and an infectious sense of fun although if you havent seen the previous mission impossible rogue nation you might be a little lost as this is the first entry in the series that isnt a standalone film i never thought id see the day when id be enjoying this franchise more than bond or bourne but here we are fallout raises the bar in terms of story action and spectacle and gets my highest recommendation
Oct 12 2019,negative,i just watched this turd it was like watching a video game it went here and there with lots of action for no particular reason whatever plot there was only strung together the stuntfightchase sequences for all the chaos the hero always ended up in the right place in the nick of timealways figured out exactly what they needed and all without any explanation of how they got there this was the movie for a short attention span audience 
Oct 10 2019,positive,this honestly was a spectacular action film cruise as usual killed it cavil was a great villain if not a great superman and the visuals were off the charts
Oct 9 2019,positive,brillant one of the best action movies ever made
Oct 7 2019,positive,a breath of fresh air into this franchise that keeps tom cruise at the top of his game 
Oct 6 2019,positive,exactly what a mission impossible movie should be a truly fun watch with action scenes that had a lot of love put into them you can tell they care about doing good stunts
Oct 5 2019,positive,so good amazing writing and the best action in an mi film to date
Oct 5 2019,positive,tom cruises still got it
Oct 5 2019,positive,how do these things just keep getting better
Oct 5 2019,positive,this movie blends action story and emotion into a wonderfully made film it manages to do something that all the other mi movies struggle to do call back to the previous movies thats what helps bring in the emotion and story to a high point that excites its audience
Oct 3 2019,positive,exact rating 9610    mission impossible  fallout is the most actionpackedexplosive installment in an already chaotic franchise further proving that the only impossibility is the failure of the mission the intense action was cranked up to 100 making sure to leave nothing unscathed by the chaos that is left in the trail while the movie was overall immensely predictable the plot was still solid and the storyline was still immensely entertaining the acting was as awesome as usual both from returning cast members and new ones adding in great emotion to all of the characters which wouldve otherwise been rendered as twodimensional within a dumb action movie the characters themselves were well written allowing for a great variety of different personalities to intermingle and add a greater depth within the film making it feel sophisticated and emotionally realistic the tone of the film was great allowing for the film to be mainly intense with legroom for some comedic moments what also made this film really great was that it is the first sequel in the franchise to have more of a direct continuation from a previous storyline instead of just sticking with the james bond pattern of independent adventures with recurring characters in each film overall this film was really well done it was the most actionpacked and explosive installment by far while managing to remain emotionally complex and wellacted even if the plot line was predictable
Sep 29 2019,positive,i love this movie with all my strength arguably the best in the franchise and 2018
Sep 27 2019,positive,absolutely worth the ticket enjoyed every moment of the movi   and must have on dvd bluray or on your hdd space
Sep 25 2019,positive,من الممتع حقا معرفة ان الصراع الذي حصل في الفيلم لم يكن مبرمجا حاسوبيا كالمتعاد انما حقيقيا بنسبة كبيرة جدا     الفيلم ممتع حقا و فيه مشاهد لاتنسى   it is really interesting to know that the conflict that took place in the film was not computer programmed as usual but very real  the movie is really interesting and has memorable scenes 
Sep 20 2019,negative,a cinematic comic book that is beyond belief from the start 
Sep 15 2019,positive,not really anything bad to say about this movie watched at home on 91419 exciting from start to finish a bit convoluted and not very clear about who is who perhaps when i watch it again ill know more worthy rewatch 
Sep 15 2019,positive,this movie had so many fun clever exciting moments but it tried my patience with toolong action sequences and a long running time i wish they would leave us wanting more not less

Sep 10 2019,positive,the best in the series top notch action
Sep 9 2019,positive,bringing the franchise to a new height an amazing new addition to this amazing franchise the setpieces are phenomenal as always 
Sep 8 2019,neutral,predictably unpredictable painfully melodramatic with the depiction of ethan hunt as humanitys savior providing the only comic relief despite simon pegg being in the movie
Sep 8 2019,positive,favorite mission yet cavill along with tom and the rest of the crew killed it
Sep 7 2019,negative,ill give it a star for the ending we turned it off right as the timer on the bomb hit 000 and the screen went white i can honestly say  after over 2 hours of waiting  my girlfriend and i were pleasantly surprised by an actual plot twist that we had not anticipated    the rest of the movie proudly flaunted a painfully cliched stereotypical actionmovie framework an irritatingly predictable plot with a cast that constantly seemed to be on the brink of boring themselves to death on set    to summarize the acting and really the movie altogether  i offer the following formula for your consideration  1 literally any predictable eventrevelation that the writersproducers think they invented to completely obliterate the audiences preconceived notions of modern cinema  2 every single character the audience is expected to root for not breaking a single sweat in their acting arsenal during the build up to this mindaltering revelation  3 the most agonizingly obviously outcome to previously mentioned eventrevelation  4 every single character the audience is expected to root for oh are you the audience surprised by insert eventrevelation i on the other hand remain unfazed by this insert eventrevelation because i had known all along that this would ultimately be the outcome in fact  all of those actions you saw leading up to this insert eventrevelation that were somehow both incredibly predictable yet statistically improbable to foresee were all part of myour premeditated plan that resulted in this exact outcome  5 every single character the audience is expected to root against also audibly unvexed and bored i will now try my absolute best to act surprised while simultaneously launching my extremely specific counterattack that i had obviously devised in advance for this exact scenario
Sep 6 2019,positive,great movie lots of action
Sep 6 2019,positive,the very best mission impossible film so far

Sep 2 2019,positive,this is the mission impossible style of movie we grew to love with the originals that fine line between seeing the action we want to see without the whole movie being entirely unrealistic 
Sep 1 2019,positive,somehow the mission impossible franchise gets better with age and fallout is no exception not only is it the best in the series but also one of the best spy films ever made the stunts alone earn that distinction if theres a time to apply the term super spy its now the twists pile on the tension never lets up and the human element has never been more present 
Sep 1 2019,positive,this movie is so perfect watch it and you will know it

Aug 27 2019,positive,you dont go into a mission impossible movie expecting many aspects of reality but this particular entry appears to stretch the line very thin
Aug 25 2019,negative,just your normal spy movie nothing to interesting or exciting
Aug 24 2019,positive,an nonstop edgeofyourseatentertaining action flick of the highest order
Aug 24 2019,negative,could not get past the first ten minutes the big names in this just did not seem realistically invested i can get more convincing acting off the tv show my mom forced me to watch as a kid that this franchise was based on
Aug 23 2019,positive,fast paced thriller with a pulsepounding end but i wish the could put in a bit more humor in the camaraderie its always so deadly serious
Aug 19 2019,positive,great action packed movie with a great story a must see for action junkies
Aug 19 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout is exciting and exhilarating from beginning to end in the newest installment 
Aug 15 2019,positive,gripping the entire way  not one minute to get up to take the dog out without pausing
Aug 14 2019,negative,a sad excuse of a movie that shows us a story so simple and uncreative it begs the question of why the mission impossible series hasnt had its fallout

Jul 29 2019,negative,overly long and badly cast  every set piece more unbelievable than the last and for the mi series this is saying something   all that was missing was riding missiles bareback or maybe surfing on a jet going mach 1   tom cruise seems to be going through familiar paces with no enjoyment and henry cavill is thuggish and uninteresting as the villain
Jul 28 2019,negative,snoozefest  worst one in the bunch  i cant believe they made this and fans loved it  what did i miss  i found it slow and boring luckily we watched it on cable tv and didnt pay the money to see it in the theater
Jul 26 2019,positive,easy to understand plot with relentless action sequences that make for one of the finest action movies of the decade
Jul 22 2019,positive,tom cruise and the rest of the teamcheck high speed car chasescheck multiple plot twistscheck rooftop runningcheck and last second callscheck your typical mi movie how can you go wrong 67
Jul 21 2019,positive,awesome movie fastpaced funny exciting beautifully shot and above all impossible to not enjoy highly recommend this movie
Jul 13 2019,neutral,this is not an intelligent movie it is not a well written film and it is not a particularly ingenious film but it is a film made with immense passion tremendously filmed brilliantly edited and that above all understands what it wants and how it wants to achieve it as one of the best action tapes that have been made in recent years mission impossible  fallout deserves a look without prejudice
Jul 13 2019,negative,one of the worst and unbelievable movies ive had the misfortune to watch
Jul 11 2019,positive,epic film only let down by henry cavill angela bassett rebecca ferguson and vanessa kirbys characters and performances
Jul 10 2019,positive,this brand new mi is what weve wanted in action cinema for so long
Jul 9 2019,positive,some good ass plot twists to make the story more and more amazing
Jul 8 2019,positive,action moviemaking at its best one of the more impressive aspects of several is the filmmakers use of locations this mi actually has me looking forward to the next installment of the franchise 
Jul 8 2019,positive,phenomenal movie that does a great job of increasing tension and making you feel the action as it unfolds by far the best mission impossible so far which is very impressive alec baldwin is very good in his role as director of the imf 
Jul 7 2019,positive,the best mi film in the franchise is the newest and 6th one with its star at 55 years old impossible no its mission accomplished
Jul 3 2019,positive,what christopher mcquarrie demonstrated with mission impossible  fallout is that the action rises to the next level with spectacular and fantastic action sequences made by tom cruise and the incorporation of henry cavill was fascinating and incredible the best in the franchise so far 
Jun 29 2019,positive,its unreal how you can like something so predictable  but its fun  cruise still has it
Jun 29 2019,positive,this movie is sixth part in the mission impossible series this is so adventureaction and best tom cruise movie  
Jun 25 2019,negative,tom cruise is just stunning but besides him the movie had many cliches of the genre and it was a little overlong for me maybe im just not suited for this type of movie
Jun 24 2019,negative,predictable and just not well done  
Jun 22 2019,positive,a strong plotfor an action movie and exhilarating action scenes but it does nothing new for the franchise let alone the genre in whole a competent and fun movie nothing more nothing less 
Jun 20 2019,positive,i love these movies and this one is up there as one of the most enjoyable
Jun 20 2019,positive,one of the best spy action movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,insane action incredible heart in your mouth stunts and a brilliant script deliver a film that puts all other action films to shame amazing
Jun 18 2019,positive,awesome and stunting action movie
Jun 18 2019,positive,this movie had a lot of action as well as some humor
Jun 17 2019,positive,thrilling from start to finish with intrigue action and romance crackling throughout this is the new standard in nonsuperhero action films add to that tom cruise doing his own crazy stunts and it is indisputable that mission impossible is better than bond better than bourne
Jun 16 2019,positive,tv 20196  the storyline is a familiar one and was a bit boring there was also a part that i felt some unnaturalness in the story development tom would probably do his best but i felt that the whole film was less impressive than usual
Jun 12 2019,positive,best action movie i even seen in my entire life  love you tom cruise
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the best action movies i have ever seen even though its main plot is pretty familiar in between the twisty storytelling fastpaced scenes and tom cruise trying to kill himself i clearly forgot the fact that i have seen this movie a billion times before the best of the mission impossible franchise mission impossible  fallout is fastpaced fun adventurous thrill ride that literally keeps you on the edge of your seat while tom cruise is jumping off an airplane riding a motorcycle hanging from a helicopter 
Jun 2 2019,negative,right ingredients but somehow manages to be completely unengaging wondered whether it was the score the cast were doing their best but overall fairly dull
Jun 1 2019,positive,keep it coming cruise from action scenesstunts an intriguing story and some awesome villains fallout is a love letter to action fans everywhere just like tom cruise this franchise is stopping anytime soon
May 31 2019,positive,every mission impossible sequel seems to be better than the last and the stunts in them more dangerous as well for those who follow the franchise there are some nice nods to earlier instalments that gel well with the story tom cruise is excellent as he shows humour love and fear all while his own life is at risk 
May 29 2019,positive,fallout is one of the best movies from the mission impossible franchise i started watching the last 3 i missed to see if they were as good as fallout they feel short on plot and entertainment fallout has all that the plot was good but with very little twist and turns to throw you off still entertaining to watch the action and thrills from the cast make it a great movie to watch
May 28 2019,positive,the best yet with each new addition you dont think they could top the last insane mission yet they do
May 27 2019,positive,in this sixth installment yes its been six special agent ethan hunt tom cruise and his crew find themselves racing against the clock after a mission goes terribly wrong    acting 8    beginning 9    characters 10    cinematographyvisuals 10    conflict 9  solid action from beginning to end keeps this film alive and well this is what you come for not a deep story or indepth character development you want to see tom cruise run really fast and jump off of tall things while the action falls just short of the quality from the third film it still packs a hard punch    genre 9  it is surprising to me that after six films and the following of a somewhat similar formula along the way this franchise still continues to stand at the pinnacle of espionage action films director christopher mcquarrie not only manages to keep the action fresh in fallout but he makes you think they could easily pull off another three not the best mi movie but it takes you on a wild ride nonetheless    memorability 9    pace 9    plot 9    resolution 9  wasnt perfect but solid enough to wrap the film up nicely i was hoping for a little more for ethan but something tells me that things are going to work out for him just fine in the end you will definitely leave the movie excited from the seventh installment    overall 91  mission impossiblefallout is clever enough to make you use your brain but not too overthetop where youre left thinking wait what i have mad respect for mcquarrie as its hard as all get out to keep a franchise fresh after a terrible second try the franchise has been balling ever since long live the running of tom cruise
May 27 2019,positive,about as good as it can get for action but all around a really wellmade film
May 26 2019,positive,exactly what you expect i wish there was more simon pegg 
May 25 2019,negative,tom cruise is well past it the acting is our and the script and plot is obvious and annoying if you value your time dont watch this
May 24 2019,negative,it was really unrealistic and henry cavel anoying iam a big fan of tom cruise films but this film sucked time does not work like that  helicopters hook like low budget movie ending 
May 21 2019,positive,the series just keeps getting better and better
May 20 2019,positive,ethan with an out of place and unnecessary dream sequence is about all that bugged me otherwise this movie is the best of the series
May 19 2019,positive,not the best mission impossible but good still
May 17 2019,neutral,what happens to bad reviews and the people who write them the opening credits want you to believe youre watching the new james bond the action is big budget and hugely unconvincing the espionage and counterintelligence backstory is token in the extreme not even cardboard cutout grade the acting is schoolyard all action hero as youd expect the plots pedestrian but mercifully at least moves along at a fair clip the dialogue spends far too much time in simpleton and whats pegg doing staying with this  is he brainwashed or selflobotomised
May 5 2019,negative,i cant believe this has such a high general rating condescendingly obvious plot with predictable twists meh
Apr 30 2019,positive,by far the best in the series full of action humour and some good twists which feels like much more than just a normal action clichã c
Apr 28 2019,negative,more of the same from this franchise only this time im pretty much over it nothing really new is added to this its just downright repetitive at this pointsee tom cruise run see tom cruise get his ass kicked but still keep on tickin see tom cruise in a motorcycle chase see tom cruise save the world at the last minute yawn think its high time for mr scientology to hang it up do something different for a change maybe a sequel to tropic thunder
Apr 26 2019,positive,this picture shows that even in his middle age tom cruise is indifagable
Apr 25 2019,positive,strengths ive noted how these movies keep getting better and this one continued that trend by delivering even more on what works the set pieces are once again ridiculous knowing that tom cruise ethan hunt does his own stunts adds a level of danger while youre watching it whether hes scaling a rope hanging from a helicopter or legitimately flying that same helicopter hes great and its tense bringing back sean harris solomon lane was brilliant it really makes this feel like a sequel to the last one and he is a great villain his voice is menacing and hes smart enough to be a true threat adding henry cavill august walker was also genius he brought an imposing physical rival combine him with lane and youve got a formidable antagonist team the work done by the imf team is again fun and their interplay continues to be a highlight of the series i loved rebecca ferguson ilsa faust almost as much in this one as the previous installment there are some thrilling moments and great twists peppered in throughout this as well as some fights that will leave you breathless also love needs to be shown to the score they make the best use of the iconic mission impossible theme during one particular scene    weaknesses though i liked cavills performance and the idea behind his character there were issues he gets some awful lines of dialogue and the movie kind of spoiled his villainous side through the trailer that took a lot away from the moment i do feel this is a bit too long and it drags at a few points    overall the best installment of the franchise huge action good acting a solid score and edge of your seat thrills
Apr 25 2019,positive,best mission impossible yet still great even if youre not a fan of the series of films
Apr 22 2019,positive,the mission impossible series finally manages to outdo bond and it does it by borrowing and modernising many of its most audacious set pieces from over the years and always putting cruise at the centre of the jaw dropping action his obvious presence in the truly daredevil stunt scenes takes the breath away cavill also makes an impression as a dashing and imposing cia agent and thorn in ethan hunts side but not all of the cast get the same opportunities harris spends most of the film tied up and kirby is glamorous but likewise underused the baggage of hunts private life from previous movies might be one too many ingredients in the mix but these are small gripes fallout is slick and confident with stunning location filming and ontheedgeofyourseat entertainment delivered with class and style
Apr 16 2019,positive,great movie lots of action some tense moments on major scenes but fantastic
Apr 15 2019,positive,tom cruise reprises his role of super agent ethan hunt accepting a mission with impossible stakes should he choose to accept it his support team is back with ving rhames simon pegg and rebecca ferguson christopher mcquarrie teams up with cruise for another adrenaline pumping entry into the expanding mission impossible franchise    ethan is soon reminded of his past when he is shown a picture of his deceased wife which is poignant if you have been familiar with her presence in past movies he is an unstoppable force attempting to keep the world safe completing one mission at a time however he has his limits and it still haunts him how it turned out with his wife the theme of trying to let go of the past but not being able to will repeat itself throughout the picture     his trust is only placed in his circle of associates and understandably so given how he has been betrayed in the past the story starts to really take off when ethan and his associates have to deal with the repercussions of a failed mission henry cavill makes his presence as another agent who disagrees with ethans methods scrutinizing most of his moves this film tries to show ethan as more flawed starting to struggle with his age and not an unbreakable machine there is some success and the picture of his wife clearly affects him piercing a seemingly impenetrable emotional armor    the movie fails when it shows his wife later in the film as the scene is poorly constructed and we do not get a real satisfying payoff for what the characters went through this felt rushed so we can get back to the world saving events and the tension of a short amount of time to accomplish the mission stakes are incredibly high but it never feels possible ethan will fail despite the enormous odds it would be difficult for the movie to go into another direction and cruise is the driving force behind these films but they could have played more with ethans character and made it feel he was in real danger the confines of continuing the franchise prevents the film from taking any real risks with advancing a more interesting narrative     the motivations of characters are not explored very well with them changing their allegiance or showing their true colors so readily cavill and other characters present in the film could have been more intriguing with more development development suffers at the hands of spectacle and unfolding spectacular action set pieces action sequences are enthralling and help to keep the frenetic pace we are also treated to cruise performing extraordinary stunts and over the top choreography    the best action movies have healthy doses of incredible choreography but they also have characters worth caring about under the stress they are placed under this picture suffers under the weight of continuing a highly successful franchise maybe it is the reminder of the world needing saving again but this has been done too often with smaller stakes being more welcome the tension build up just needed to have different methods rather than regurgitated methods such as a countdown on bombs     ethan is still an unstoppable force and this makes it difficult to relate to him a problem lies with the movie feeling like just another entry in the franchise when it could use a different take where maybe ethan is not the protagonist still the movie is a lot of fun and the action is something to behold even if the story feels more of the same i will always watch each entry with an eye for the action but hoping the franchise decides to take a risk or two with subsequent movies
Apr 4 2019,positive,spoiler alerts  mission impossible â fallout is a 2018 action spy film movie written directed and produced by christopher mcquarrie it is the sixth film in the mission impossible series the movie is a direct sequel to mission impossible â rogue nation 2015 the movie stars tom cruise simon pegg rebecca ferguson sean harris alec baldwin vanessa kirby  henry cavill   this time around the cia is forced to work with the impossible mission force imf still led by ethan hunt cruise to recapture arch villain solomon lane played by sean harris to stop a disaster of epic proportions cia worker august walker is played by henry cavill who is new to the series  i really liked this film because the action is jaw dropping its got a great cast and a runtime of 147 minutes which was just right we see cruise doing new stunts we have never seen before in one amazing scene we see walker and hunt parachute out of aeroplane into a thunderstorm cruise was so dedicated to doing a good job that he injured himself filming an action scene that went wrong in jumping from one building to another he broke his ankle and the movie had to be put on hold for 34 months  henry cavill makes an excellent good guybad guy character which is a change from him playing superman  at times this film was a bit confusing for instance the scene where you see benji dunn simon pegg wearing solomon lanes mask annoyingly the trailer shows a thrilling scene of a helicopter spinning out of control and nearly hitting a truck however that scene didnt make the final cut of the film  i think this movie is good action flick but the director left out interesting scenes
Apr 2 2019,positive,really good action flick
Apr 1 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout is an indescribable gem period
Apr 1 2019,positive,look i know hunt losing means devastation for the world but seriouslyhe needs to lose in order to bring some stakes back into it what made the first mi good was loosing his team
Mar 30 2019,positive,so much action never a dull moment
Mar 29 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie from the cast to the director to the action this movie is just simply amazing probably one of the best action movies ive seen this movie is worth watching on the biggest screen you can find with the loudest system you can find go race out to the theaters and watch this movie right away
Mar 26 2019,positive,seriously engaging and one hell of an action packed film couldnt take my eyes off the screen
Mar 25 2019,positive,rogue nation was the high watermark for this series of films so its no surprise at all to see mcquarrie back in the directors chair  it doesnt quite reach those heights but this is really enjoyable fair all the way through  some cracking set pieces the cruiser on top form and a completely incoherent plot obviously  all good funwell except for the silly face mask bits obvs which are still shit
Mar 23 2019,positive,710 fun but tedious
Mar 21 2019,negative,finally i saw the light  this movie is just like all the other mission impossible movies  absolutely nothing original  just like the previous 5  they should not make mission impossible parts 7 and 8 as allegedly planned  fool me once shame on you fool me 5 times much much much shame on me
Mar 20 2019,positive,fantastic movie with a good story with a lot of good and unexpected twists
Mar 17 2019,positive,extremely intense and action packed and keeps you at the edge of your seat but im getting tired of the cliche bomb diffusing type of plot
Mar 17 2019,negative,for some reason the later mission impossible films have completely lost my interest it just seems like another remix of the previous films
Mar 17 2019,positive,one of the best modern action movies with tom cruise risking his life  for our enterteiment
Mar 11 2019,positive,me and my family enjoyed watching this you can tell cruises age is starting to show though there were some parts of the movie that were just too unpredictable though and thats why i am not giving it 5 stars
Mar 10 2019,positive,9610 mission impossible fallout  the amount and quality of action is nothing short of spectacular character development on point plot done well if you only see a few movies in theaters every year this should be the one you see
Mar 8 2019,positive,better than average mi movie if youve seen the rest then you know what to expect
Mar 8 2019,positive,i thought newer mission impossibles would lack the soul of the earlier remakesmoviefications but i was wrong this one in particular was incredible
Mar 7 2019,positive,compared to previous mi films the action isnt as good and the plot abandons any logic in the first 5 minutes 
Mar 1 2019,positive,mission impossible â fallout is the sixth movie in the franchise itâtms got the over the top spy thriller action sequences the franchise is known for if you enjoyed the past movies you would enjoy this one too i for one am over the mi franchise ones i was past my teenage years initial i was enjoying this movie with its spy intrigue clean fight sequences and bike chases but as we got near the climax it all became a bit too crazy for me the best parts for me where the lighter comical moments by simon pegg
Mar 1 2019,positive,it was good the same mission impossible goodness they keep bringing back
Feb 27 2019,positive,standard action movie
Feb 27 2019,neutral,personally isnt really my bag if you are into action movies it this is a good one but i personally didnt feel very invested
Feb 25 2019,positive,friglin boop bop amazin
Feb 25 2019,positive,right before i watched this movie around the time it came out i remember how anticipated i was i had looked at all the positive reviews and i thought it would exceed my expectations but unfortunately it didnt meet my expectations and instead was more of an action film than a mission impossible film even though it had amazing action scenes and stunts i was upset it wasnt as clever or as smart with all the cool gadgets a lot of its predecessors had
Feb 25 2019,positive,i didnt think cruise still had it in him but i was wrong cavill was a lot of fun and had great presence i kind of wish they didnt kill him off so we could see more of him in future movies
Feb 20 2019,positive,i have a hard time deciding whether this or fury road is the best action movie of the decade just watch both this film allows tom cruise to show his acting chops more better than any of these since the first mi film rogue nation was already a fantastic movie that made me pay attention tochristopher mcquarrie but this one shows he may be one of the best action directors out there the only flaw i can think of is that henry cavills line delivery is very slightly cheesy at times but that is really nitpicking everyone else gives basically flawless performances even though jeremy renner was great in rogue nation you forget about the fact he is missing from this one interestingly i do hope he returns in the future though
Feb 20 2019,neutral,not bad  tom cruise still managing to do his own stunts not bad
Feb 20 2019,positive,wow fantastic movie  the action is phenomenal best mission impossible by far
Feb 20 2019,positive,nothing mind blowing plot wise but a decent action movie all around
Feb 17 2019,positive,is a fun movie better then most modern films  but if this is the best mission impossible movie the others must be bad cause this is by no means amazing
Feb 17 2019,positive,two years after solomon lanes sean harris capture the remnants of his organization the syndicate have reorganized as a rogue terrorist group called the apostles imf agent ethan hunt tom cruise is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in berlin from eastern european gangsters before the apostles can he is joined by benji dunn simon pegg and luther stickell ving rhames for the mission but the team fails when stickell is taken hostage and hunts attempt to save him allows the apostles to make off with the plutonium the team later captures nuclear weapons expert nils delbruuk who designed nuclear devices for an extremist named john lark they confirm that lark hired the apostles in order to find lane furious at the imfs failure to secure the plutonium cia director erica sloane angela bassett instructs special activities division operative august walker henry cavill to shadow hunt as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium    rotten tomatoes critical consensus reads fast sleek and fun mission impossible fallout lives up to the impossible part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them varietys peter debruge called the film the seriess most exciting installment to date saying mcquarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces his combat scenes are tense muscular and clean shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense entertainment weeklys chris nashawaty gave the film an a grade commenting on cruise that hes still hollywoods hungriest movie star with the series getting better twistier and more deliriously fun with each installment george simpson of the express complimented the action is brutal and gutpunching the pacing heartpumping and the stakes so high its gaspinducing at times adding fallout is an improvement on all the previous films failings drawing together all the best aspects of them simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve he gave the film five out of five stars the telegraphs tim robey summed up the film as spectacular and eyepopping deeming it the blockbuster of the summer with a pleasingly sinuous plot and calling the film and its series a bondlike franchise he also rated the film five out of five stars     with the mission impossible franchise tom cruise has created a bond like legacy that keeps on going and you keep on wishing for more since the first one all the way back to 1996 these six films have been of different standards but yet really entertaining from several point of views personally i really liked mission impossible mission impossible  ghost protocol and mission impossible  rogue nation with mission impossible  fallout cruise takes us further on to fantastic nearexhausting actionstunt sequences that is just out of this world but i think that this is not the best film storywise in the series director christopher mcquarrie who wrote the script as well did not manage to keep it fully together in my opinion but his direction does tom cruise is in true action mode for sure so much that he broke his ankle during the shoot and i do think that henry cavills special activities division operative august walker is a good bad guy with a moustache and the driving force of a terminator i loved mi6 agent ilsa faust our swedish pride rebecca ferguson in mission impossible  rogue nation so i was happy to resee her in this film she just rocks mission impossible  fallout is not bad but not as good as i hoped when i saw the first trailers     trivia in august 2017 tom cruise suffered an injury while filming a stunt jumping from one building to another he was able to grab onto the other buildingthanks to a harness strapped onto him and his history of performing his own stunts for action films but his ankle fractured upon the impact of the jump cruise then got up and attempted to run it off which was what the scene called for before he and the crew decided to stop filming shooting was delayed for eight weeks following the injury but the footage of the stunt used in the film and its trailers just so happened to be the actual injury    it was announced by cruise on january 14 2019 that the seventh and eighth mission impossible films will be shot backtoback with mcquarrie writing and directing both films for july 23 2021 and august 5 2022 release in february 2019 ferguson confirmed her return for the seventh installment
Feb 16 2019,positive,amazing plot exciting action beautifully scripted and fun mission impossible fallout will keep you on your seats until the very last second of the movie
Feb 8 2019,positive,a very fun movie with a surprisingly good story in fact i actually got lost in it because it was actually a little indepth i had my mom explain it to me afterwards the acting was really good and the characters were a fun fit to their roles the action scenes were easily the best part of the movie the stunts were incredible and extremely impressive that the real actors did their own stunts they were not small stunts too but really big ones that were easily jawdropping i waited three years for the next one and i am perfectly happy with this result even though that it was long and i got a little confused with the story
Feb 7 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout was a really good film i enjoyed the pace of the film and also liked the different plot twists one generic convection i liked within the film was the race against time scene when tom cruise skydived out of the plane and then had to save his friend as he had been struck by lightning and they were descending very fast and tom cruise had to try and wake him up so he could deploy his parachute this scene was very intense especially with the soundtrack that was used to build suspense mission impossible fallout i thought that the story line was very good it kept me interested throughout the whole film  even though i have never seen any of the previous films the story line in the film was easy to get a hold of and allowed me to get to grips with what is happening  the use of sound effects made the film seem very intense and realistic to what you was watching the use of different camera angles and clever editing made the film much very gripping on its own there is not a boring moment throughout the whole film     the mise en scene in the film has a wide range of differences for example some parts of the movie are set in major capitals of the world such as london and paris but towards the end of the film in the helicopter fight scene  it is set within the outskirts of china within the snowy mountains the costume worn within the film make it easy to know who is who  for example ethan hunt played by tom cruise is shown wearing a suit at the start of the film so we know he is an important character to the story also the suit hints that he may be james bond style character which we soon find out he is
Feb 6 2019,positive,well i have to say that you guys were not kidding this is a fantastic action film more than twenty years since the first of these six films had come out and it is still a surprise when a mission impossible film ends up this good it really feels like we are living in a solid era for action franchises with the raid john wick mi and even the fast and furious for our bmovie action goodness we live in exploding times    honestly i dont think i have seen an action moviespy game thriller that was this much fun in a while everything they did in this film was top notch from the stunts to the chase sequence to the amazing helicopter chasei mean damn also if cavill not being superman anymore means we can see him as the beast he was in this movie with an equally as beast mode a mustache then i am all good with that there are a few nitpicks i thought that the movie dragged a bit between the middle and the end i also had a few moments when i wasnt exactly convinced with cruises acting but nothing that really took me out of the film also while there was a spy story as always with this franchise it still relies on the stunts and action to do the heavy lifting which isnt bad when the action you have is this good     mi fallout is very good one of the better action films of the last while easily deserving of the praise it has gotten and making me wish i had seen it a lot sooner
Feb 6 2019,positive,a little wonky in the beginning but overall a spot on hit
Feb 5 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie from the cast to the director to the action this movie is just simply amazing probably one of the best action movies ive seen this movie is worth watching on the biggest screen you can find with the loudest system you can find go race out to the theaters and watch this movie right away
Feb 4 2019,positive,my favorite mission impossible movie to the date and thats saying a lot
Feb 4 2019,positive,following in how are the impossible mission movies just say that if you like the action genre this movie should see it 
Feb 2 2019,positive,suspend disbelief and enjoy one of the blockbuster of 2018
Feb 1 2019,negative,really awful film couldnt see it til the end loved all the others very disappointed
Jan 31 2019,positive,it is quite simply outstanding that tom continues to personally act out many of his own stunts fun movie to watch and quite crazy at times but semi predictable for the twist that happens halfway through the film
Jan 30 2019,positive,tom cruise risks life and limbliterally in many instancesfor his sixth goround as ethan hunt in mission impossible  fallout the finest action film since 2015s mad max fury road in writerdirector christopher mcquarries adrenalized espionage thriller hunt is tasked with recovering a trio of plutonium cores while juggling his relationships with colleagues simon pegg ving rhames alec baldwin alluring spy ilsa faust rebecca ferguson and former wife julia michelle monaghannot to mention ciaassigned assassin august walker henry cavill who has orders to kill hunt should he stray from his assignment that intertwining of the personal and professional provides a sturdy backbone for a series of set pieces that especially in imax are nothing short of astonishing mcquarrie begins with a slambang bathroom brawl and then continually ups the eyeopening ante culminating with an aerial showdown between hunt and walker aboard helicopters that establishes cruise and the series as the reigning kings of hollywood spectacle
Jan 30 2019,positive,clever and captivating
Jan 30 2019,positive,by far the best mission impossible movie that there is im not saying that there arent a few flaws here and there
Jan 29 2019,positive,in this film the main character is portrayed by tom cruise bad people want to throw an atomic bomb on the world and kill many people tc is working in a secret organization and he must save the world in the film you can see many jokes if you really want to watch this film go to azino777
Jan 29 2019,positive,first off i hate tom cruise the person tom cruise the actor is greatespecially in his mi films i agree with the complexity of the plot its too thick but you can see it through the action and cinematography is incredible its definitely worth the watch 
Jan 28 2019,positive,one of the best actionspy films i have seen in a long time
Jan 27 2019,positive,fantastic just fantastic gorgeous cinematography brilliant performances by supporting cast and by cruise and brilliant choreographed stunts just amazing
Jan 26 2019,negative,high adrenaline throughout
Jan 24 2019,positive,fallout is a great action film and you would be crazy to attempt another film in the mi series after this mcquarrie has just signed on for 7 and 8 which is a bad move in my opinion good for mcquarrie in the money sense but bad to attempt more after rogue nation and fallout cruise once again brings us insane stunt work and some of these will have you looking away you have to give it to him he can really entertain this sequel is a great followup to rogue nation a direct sequel and it delivers on the action but not a good ending i was hoping they might return to a more espionage style film for the sequels but that wont be the case with mcquarrie this was a nice closure to number 3 and it leaves the door open for more development mi can only fail from here that is the sad reality but mcquarrie might throw us another two film curve ball 19012019
Jan 23 2019,positive,these films since ghost protocol have been an incredible joy to see in the theater the pacing is great the story is engaging and the action is an absolute spectacle the whole cast did great my favorite action movie of 2018
Jan 22 2019,positive,best mission impossible movie with a lot of action and laughs its in my top 5 movies
Jan 22 2019,positive,what now worries me is how you will beat this one for 2021
Jan 20 2019,positive,it was non stop action from start to finish i was enthralled from start to finish the best theater experience i have ever had
Jan 20 2019,neutral,they just keep getting better but they never get good
Jan 20 2019,positive,the best in the franchise such an enjoyable watch
Jan 19 2019,positive,of course this is an unbelievable escapist actionadventurespy movie  and it is great  the best mission impossible so far and one of the best films of its genre ever  and it also works as a fabulous travelogue too especially at the end  ferguson cavill and cruise are great
Jan 19 2019,positive,ive seen this movie multiole times now and i love it every time the plot isnt very orignal but i still thought it was good its really the amazing stunts and the great characters that make this one of my favorite action movies of all time and my favorite of the franchise i really love the score too its very exciting and well done
Jan 19 2019,positive,while it is already the sixth movie from the franchise itself but mission impossible  fallout still able to become one of the fresh action movie in recent time
Jan 18 2019,negative,there will not be mi movies like the first two now it is so about situations that are completely surreal
Jan 18 2019,positive,another mi movie with similar set pieces and characters the story isnt too complicated which works well for this type of actionpacked movie the story is good enough to enjoy throughout the whole film
Jan 17 2019,positive,ethan hunt is back but did he really need to be dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but i dont think they did anything new here it felt like a very generic action movie to me just like they were working off of a template just enough to be entertaining but not entertaining enough to keep me from looking at my phone the reason im rating it as well as i am is that the helicopter sequence near the end of the movie was shot beautifully and was easily the tensest and most exciting part of the entire film
Jan 17 2019,positive,the plot could be a bit better but its really well done and worth watching
Jan 16 2019,positive,christopher mcquarrie did again by making probably not just the best mission impossible film but one of the best action films of this decade tom cruise is once again amazing in the film and still doing his own stunts in his mid50s it keeps you on the edge of your seat especially through the action scenes that seem so real and authentic henry cavill was a great addition to the film playing along side cruise and everyone else was great in this almost two and a half hour epic action film
Jan 15 2019,positive,prolonging the franchise yet again fallout is an exceptional installment with nonstop thrills and insane action
Jan 15 2019,positive,best mission impossible movie ever this is the best action movie of 2018 by far congrats to all the cast the director and production team this is a masterpiece much better than some bond movies an instant classic a must watch
Jan 14 2019,positive,amazing it is my favorite mission impossible movie and of all the movies this movie is my second favorite movie of all movies
Jan 14 2019,positive,one of the greatest action movies ever
Jan 14 2019,positive,when i think about this movie i can still smell the popcorn and feel my feet sticking to the floors a true action movie this series once again only gets better and better as time goes on tom cruise is a psychopathic child in a mans body but that doesnt change my mind that his film is awesome
Jan 13 2019,negative,another in a long series of confusing  poorly thought out plotlines
Jan 13 2019,positive,way overhyped im honestly not sure why everyone is like this is the best action movie ever it was pretty good its not that crazy of a movie or a story tom cruise doing his own stunts adds a lot to the intensity of the movie its not a bad movie its not quite as good as people are making it out to be though this is a slightly toneddown version of previous mi movies that were just way too overthetop this movie has more heart and they actually pause the action every once in a while to have real meaningful dialogue i still feel like the characters involved were underdeveloped but theyre at least going in the right direction it still feels like theres a little too much going on ilsa seems like shes just thrown in there to be the powerful female character who can do no wrong and who never loses oh wait she does a couple times but shes just fine after that from being hit by a car to just killing everyone its kind of ridiculous and borderline wait for it mary sueish theres a strange moment in the movie where ilsa suddenly joins up with them and its never really explained because the scene before shes hiding in the shadows and randomly shooting guys and then in the next scene she hops into a truck with them without anyone saying anything kinda strange they toned down the feminist bull crap but its still there for that reason it doesnt feel quite as real or intense but its a movie sigh were so starved for good films that it seems well freak out over anything even remotely good these days its an improvement but this is no classic its just good not great dont get your hopes too high
Jan 13 2019,positive,i suggest you to watch the the bike chase part      and very nice movie 
Jan 13 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout is the newest and best entry to the mission impossible franchise since the original fallout uses its incredible cast and brilliant fight choreography to put the previous entries to shamethe film is extremely creative with its fight scenes and at some points the landscape is visually pleasing the film is also beautifully shot which with all of this the film is able to archive everything it wanted and more to put in one more great film to the franchise
Jan 13 2019,positive,the most action packed movie i have ever watched has you on the edge of your seat all till the end great movie best mission impossible yet 
Jan 12 2019,positive,seriously how do these films keep getting better mission impossible has been quietly setting the standard for pg13 action films since the debut of m3
Jan 11 2019,positive,im not usually one for tom cruise but he really kills it
Jan 11 2019,positive,tom cruises best film yet
Jan 11 2019,positive,a solid addition to the mi series tom cruise is determined to make mi the american answer to james bond good cinematic experience forgettable generic bad guy plot but good entertainment to zone out for 2hrs
Jan 11 2019,positive,it is going to be an impossible mission to top this movie 
Jan 11 2019,positive,in my opinion the best mission impossible tom cruise is tom cruise the stunts and fight scenes and other action set pieces are great a fairly good plot but who watches mission impossible for plot you watch it for fun and this has fun by the metric ton in an era where super heroes are our main action heroes its good to go back to the classic secret agent human character henry cavill does a great job at convincing me hes not superman this is the first time ive seen him as not superman and i was surprised basically this movie is fun which is what we need right now
Jan 10 2019,positive,my favorite movie of 2018
Jan 10 2019,positive,featuring some of the best actions sequences and a allout performance from tom cruise mission impossible fallout proves the sixth movie in a franchise can be the best and most fun 
Jan 9 2019,positive,the perfect action movie and is easily the best film this year
Jan 9 2019,positive,this movie is a masterpiece better than all before it
Jan 9 2019,positive,mission impossible hits the mark again with the newest installment in the series fallout  boasting highoctane action and thrilling stunts this movie will not disappoint it also dives in deep into an intricate plot expertly conceived and told by cristopher mcquarrie henry cavill is a fine addition to the franchise in short this movie cannot get any better and if you havent seen it yetwhat are you doing
Jan 8 2019,neutral,mission impossible fallout  2018    plot  same missions are not a choice on a dangerous assignment to recover stolen plutonium ethan hunt tom cruise chooses to save his team over completing the mission allowing nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of a deadly network of highlyskilled operatives intent on destroying civilisation now with the world at risk ethan and his imf team simon pegg ving rhames rebecca ferguson are forced to become reluctant partners with a hardhitting cia agent henry cavill as they race against time to stop the nuclear fallout    review  although the action scenes are top class and the stunts are amazing this movie just seemed like another tom cruise action film to me the storyline was half decent even though the director overcomplicated it with technical jargon and it was good to see the original cast back after watching the bonus material i dont think you can appreciate the work that goes into making one of these movies especially with cruise doing most of the stunts and the director could have easily used a green screen for a lot of the locations which he decided against my problem with the film is the fact that its not that different from the rest of the mision possible movies its just cruise pushing the bar when it comes to the various stunts including learning to fly a helicopter for this film dont get me wrong its still worth a watch if youre into your epic action films but im personally getting a bit fed up with cruise running jumping and driving every vehicle made after his amazing performance in tropic thunder which a lot of people rated him for i think its about time cruise stopped saving the day against all odds anyway two years after solomon lanes sean harris capture the remnants of his organisation the syndicate have reorganised as a rogue terrorist group called the apostles imf agent ethan hunt tom cruise is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in berlin before the apostles can he is joined by benji dunn simon pegg and luther stickell ving rhames for the mission but the team fails when luther is taken hostage and ethans attempt to save him allows the apostles to make off with the plutonium furious at imfs failure to secure the plutonium cia director erica sloane angela bassett instructs special activities division operative august walker henry cavill to shadow ethan as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium i think you can guess where the movie goes from here basically ethan and his team go through hell to try and retrieve the plutonium which they lost at the beginning of the film with the help of mi6 agent iisa faust rebecca ferguson who saves ethans life a few times during the movie their information finally leads them to a medical camp in kashmir were ethans estranged wife julia michelle monaghan is working the team deduces that solomon and august are actually working together and that they plan to detonate the nuclear weapons over the siachen glacier contaminating the water supply of pakistan india and china with a third of its population affected the world will descend into anarchy from which solomon and august hope a new world order will emerge now you know why i said that the director overcomplicated the plot basically some nutter wants to blow up half the world so ethan and his team have to stop him personally i thought that there were way too many characters in the film and the action went on forever you can see where every penny of the budget went especially as they shot in real locations but i would have liked more character building and some wit to lighten the mood it is nonstop from the beginning to the end which in some ways becomes a bit claustrophobic after a while we all know that ethan is going to save the day once again and after many years of saving the world the stupid cia director still thought that he went rogue which i thought was ridiculous anyway i think that tom cruise has done every stunt known to man by now so i think its time for him to hang up his adrenaline junkie shoes and try something new to entertain audiences watchable    roundup  this movie was written and directed by christopher mcquarrie who also brought you the way of the gun which i really enjoyed jack reacher and mission impossible rogue nation he also produced valkyrie and jack reacher never go back and he wrote the usual suspects the way of the gun valkyrie the tourist jack reacher jack the giant slayer edge of tomorrow mission impossible rogue nation and the mummy which also starred tom cruise mcquarrie and cruise have built a healthy relationship over the years which is why they produce some of the most extravagant stunts seen in film it might also explain why most of tom cruises films are similar to each other and we always have the famous running scene which gets on my nerves with another top gun in the pipeline which is also being directed by mcquarrie tom cruise is definitely a true hollywood star and he is still got the audiences flocking to the cinema judging by the profit that this movie made after the terrible the mummy i did think that people had enough of cruises action blockbusters but this movie has proved that one bad movie wont tarnish his name as this is the 7th highestgrossing film of 2018 which is cruises highestgrossing film to date and the highestgrossing film in the franchise im sure the mi franchise isnt over even though cruise is 56 years old     budget 178million  worldwide gross 791million    genre action adventure thriller  cast tom cruise henry cavill ving

Jan 8 2019,negative,i wanted to like this movie but it was a letdown i dont understand why it has such a high review rating and why it still has a high liked it rating
Jan 8 2019,positive,its amazing how the mission impossible franchise just continues to get better after mi3 this may actually dethrone mi3 as the best in the series tom cruise is his normal self performing all his stunts and bringing that leading man charisma that so few actors possess while ving rhames definitely does not look like belongs physically get in shape dude youre a spy i think everyone was perfectly cast but let me give my biggest shout out to rebecca ferguson she continues to be phenomenal this film has enough twists to keep you guessing but it isnt anything too mysterious this is what modern action movies should aspire to
Jan 7 2019,positive,might be my favorite one so far cavill is a freaking beast and cruise continues to defy time bathroom fight is worth the watch alone
Jan 7 2019,positive,i think this is the best movie of the entire mi series which is very unusual for a sixth movie in a series tom cruise is once again great in the role of ethan hunt and the supporting cast does a great job of supporting him i especially was surprised by henry cavills performance i have generally liked him but some of his roles have not been my favorite however he was great in this movie acting along with tom cruise
Jan 7 2019,positive,some twists but still pretty good
Jan 7 2019,positive,tom bro listen youre a get action star you dont have to keep risking your life
Jan 6 2019,positive,when did ving rhames become the gbf vrs vibe in this one was way to soft
Jan 6 2019,positive,fun and simple movie this is what action movies like this should be
Jan 6 2019,positive,the start was quit good classic mi after the middle and towards the end it becomes a little bollywoodish for example hunt says that he does not know how to fly the helicopter by being confused as to what the display shows etc etc but flies like a pro too bollywoodish to me i dont know how this got passed the critics i think some kind of influence is involved here
Jan 6 2019,positive,tom cruise does an awesome job as always i found it to be exciting an keep you on edge of your seat entertaining all actors did a wonderful job awesome movie i loved it
Jan 5 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout does everything right it has a stellar cast is fantastically written and of course has eye popping stunts so why not give it 5 stars it is because this is essentially the same movie as the last two the feeling of the plot is too familiar am i supposed to believe ethan hunt will die spoiler alert he doesnt this franchise needs to do something big and different for longtime fans like me to stick with it
Jan 5 2019,positive,you would think after six movies this franchise would be getting old nope fallout is not only the best in the series its one of my favorite actions movies ever this is right up there with t2 raiders and fury road tom cruise has more balls than anyone on the planet the stunts and action on display here are phenomenal and the story was surprisingly easy to follow for a newcomer to this franchise what a surprise 
Jan 4 2019,positive,the plot is simple and basic as are most fastpaced action movies however this film has some of the greatest action sequences ive ever seen every punch feels like it has weight behind it the camera work and editing allow us to see what is happening in this film one of my favorite action movies ever and is definitely worth a watch
Jan 4 2019,positive,imagine if james bond movies always had sean connery in them  and they were almost always good  that is kinda what you get from the mission impossible series now running for over 20 years  tom cruise still looks good and has that frenetic running style  maybe he took a slight hit getting beaten up in the rest room but then he comes out swinging in a cavalcade of action sequences strung in to a movie  you might vaguely recall the point break remake from a couple of years back  that movie rivaled this one for stunts and scenery but while pb was all stunts and nothing else mi has settled in to a relationship film of sorts  with the girlfriend exwife and his team pegg and rhames  and of course this amps up the stakes for cruise as he has to run from friend to friend to save them  much of this is predictable of course and the world is at stake again but fallout again does a great job of retreading what is a very familiar story  there are even scenes that point out how cruise is a hamster on a wheel and trapped  supporting cast is soso  lane is nice and creepy  superman plays the ass pretty well  alec baldwin is killed  so that is always a plus in a movie  i am starting to feel bad for cruises character  every movie he saves the world and then he gets second and third guessed by suits in washington  there goes the guy that saved the world the wrong way
Jan 4 2019,positive,i really have to applaud how different and yet how consistently good the movies in this franchise have been with fallout being no exception     they played around slightly with ethan hunts character in this one to make him a little less self assured and slightly clumsy at times in fight scenes which im glad they didnt overdo as it could have drifted into slapstick and taken me out of the movie    the story is typically more complex and convoluted than it first appears but this is par for the course and isnt that hard to follow if youre paying attention    if this movie lacks anything its scenes of serious suspense the likes of which were a hallmark of the first movie and the original tv show     what you do get though are buckets of great action scenes decent characters and a nicely plotted storyand you cant complain too much at that
Jan 4 2019,neutral,impossible to rate this higher than 25 stars
Jan 4 2019,positive,best movie of the year
Jan 3 2019,positive,excellent unmissable cinematography cast story music everything you see on screen is the highest quality spectacle incredible film

Jan 3 2019,positive,as always movies with tom cruise are best
Jan 3 2019,positive,fun thrill ride with great cinematography worth a watch more than once
Jan 2 2019,positive,i see the ratings however other than toms stuntswhich were great it was not as good as previous mis sorry tom not enough backstory on some of the prominent characters who were they and how did they play into this mi completely unsure
Jan 2 2019,positive,mission impossible fallout delivers a fastpaced thriller packed with intense action that scores a great win for this now classic franchise
Jan 2 2019,positive,i found boxxy software two weeks ago now i am using it to watch all movies serials and have very easy navigate i also install app on my android p recommend to all
Jan 1 2019,positive,seems others are raving about the action which i found long repetitive fill for a flimsy plot  no surprises either  both mask uses were well telegraphed as was the identity of lark from the moment he appeared on screen  was so excited to see this film and then yawn disappointed
Jan 1 2019,positive,the mission impossible series just keeps getting better and better with every entry my personal favorite is still ghost protocol but this one is a close second behind that one tom keep cranking them out man
Jan 1 2019,positive,mi never disappoints on the action front  always entertaining and full of action  however i noticed myself getting up for breaks during the action scenes cause i thought the chasing seemed to go on forever  i have to say there is less downtime in the movie and a lot of chasing
Jan 1 2019,positive,this is by far the one of the better mi movies made in a while  a lot of action and some great fight scenes made up for part of the storyline that a stretched a little thin  overall a decent movie but it might be time to replace cruise and maybe a reboot should be in store
Dec 31 2018,positive,i just dont understand the high reviews especially from critics how long in before it was obvious superman was actually lex luthor in this movie the real kicker though was the declaration by baldwins character that he made the lateral to imfbecauseofwait for it ethan give me a break the movie is exciting if perhaps too convoluted i give it to cruise for his stunts though quite impressive
Dec 31 2018,positive,another highly entertaining mission impossible film with fantastic action sequences while the plots can get a little convuluded at times they are still very engaging and worth your time recommended
Dec 31 2018,positive,this is the most engaging entry to the mission impossible franchise with its unrelenting pace and attheedgeofyourseat action sequences intense
Dec 31 2018,positive,another standard entry in the series tom cruise is his usual self and pretty good although it feels as though hes getting a bit too old for this role now lots of action fighting and chase scenes it does stretch credibility a bit too much though 
Dec 31 2018,negative,full of cliches and cheesiness same stroy same results and same f ending i was fooled by the critics and audience rating to watch it i dont know how this movie got this much buzz
Dec 31 2018,positive,one of the best action films of recent memory this film fails to miss a beat and has you on the edge of your seat for all 2 hours and 28 minutes the film looks great and the stunts are breathtaking
Dec 31 2018,positive,good action a lot of stunts good actors a must see movie
Dec 31 2018,positive,as far as genre movies go it really doesnt get much better than this incredibly tense exciting and of course actionpacked fallout takes things to a whole new level with its relentless pace spectacular action sequences and an arresting plot that will not only have you on the very edge of your seat but also has a few twists up its sleeve which to be fair are rather predictable but forgivably so on top of all that its really nicely filmed with beautiful cinematography that makes wonderful use of some dazzling locations i heard someone described this as the action film of the century  im going to go out on a limb and say theyre not far from the truth this is absolutely one to watch like immediately
Dec 31 2018,negative,great action  typical dumb plot
Dec 31 2018,positive,good story good characters good action good good good
Dec 30 2018,positive,very well done  although it was the same thing over again
Dec 30 2018,negative,barley any action for the first hour and a half was so bored we walked out
Dec 30 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is in my opinion the best in the series everybody gives good performance and herny cavill is a great addition it was nice that this film did something new by continuing the story from the previous movie it had a great plot that you do have to really pay attention to but it is good the action and stunts a very exciting my only big complaint is that the final act was a little to predictable and by the numbers i felt they were playing things too safe and there was more noticeable cgi everything up to that was really well done     8510
Dec 30 2018,positive,very well done for tension and anxiety wish the trailers hadnt spoiled the ending
Dec 30 2018,positive,this is by far the best mi movie in the series i have not really liked any of the previous ones very much overall they ranged from 3 to 6 out of 10 but this one is a solid 10 all the way and i rarely give perfect scores fast paced and thrilling all the way through and you really can enjoy it without seeing the others just a general knowledge of who ethan is will still give you the full package of enjoyment one of the best of 2018 by far better than any of the marvel movies guaranteed
Dec 29 2018,positive,one of my favorite movies of the year the stuntwork and action sequences are just incredible i only knock it half a point because it has a few too many plot twists for its own good
Dec 29 2018,positive,good however it is a little bit slow starting out fairly clean excepts for the action and language overall i liked it however it was kindof predictable
Dec 29 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout excellent movie i could not be happier with this movie it is the best movie i have watched in the last 34 years great acting great action sequences great villains and heroes and great plot line did i mention this movie is great the plot was so captivating and constantly changing to the point of plot mastery tom cruise doing what he does best best mission impossible movie thus far rating 1010
Dec 29 2018,positive,fallout bests out the franchise with its purely entertaining mission fueled up by suspense intrigue and insane stunts
Dec 29 2018,positive,i have no idea how these films manage to continually improve but this film managed to meet the insanely high expectations we all had for it even without switching directors a first for the mi franchise we still get the joyous highoctane fun we all love from cruise and company    the movie does everything it can to avoid being ï 12another dumb action movieï 12tm the first few mi films were just ï 12tom cruise ving rhames and a rotating cast of nobodiesï 12tm but you now have a solid crew that includes simon pegg rebecca ferguson and alec baldwin because you are so invested in the characters everything carries more weight in addition to the cast a couple of plot points from the previous film carry over without making this feel like a sequel    ridiculous set pieces abound as is tradition after all who wants to pay to see mission you can probably handle this with minimal effort yes some of the action does go into the realm of ridiculous but itï 12tms done in such a fun way i didnï 12tmt even care this is how you entertain people give them a whole lot of suspense countdown timer preferred some insane stunts and enough levity to justify having simon pegg in your cast thatï 12tms all we want    oh and always make sure you get a nice long shot of tom cruise running i could watch that for days
Dec 29 2018,positive,some of the most thrilling and suspenseful action that i have ever witnessed nearly every aspect of this film is flawless a definite must see to those who love action films
Dec 28 2018,positive,this has to be one of the most enjoyable action films i have seen i wouldnt say i am a big fan of the series but something about this film made me so captivated with its great and unpredictable story and the amazing performances by rebecca fergusson and henry cavil
Dec 28 2018,positive,overused cliches and an average plot yet great acting and pretty shots and cinematography of paris but the stunts are quite impressive
Dec 28 2018,positive,one of the best movies of the year nothing but action on top of action and fun nonstop you never get to breathe with how much action is in this movie tom cruise and the rest of the crew are as kickass as ever best movie in the franchise and close to being a masterpiece   ill give it             95
Dec 28 2018,positive,ohhh the stunts loved this one  still keeping the series fresh and so entertaining  you will not regret watching this one
Dec 28 2018,positive,the best action franchise of this decade its as simple as that tom cruise is once again offering a great performance as the charismatic ethan hunt fallout is probably the best movie of the franchise
Dec 28 2018,positive,tom cruise is undeniable as an action star and in this series this entry tees up and action and lets cruise swing for the fence
Dec 28 2018,positive,if youve been with this franchise over this decade it keeps delivering time  time again best action youll see all year check it out  
Dec 28 2018,positive,never ending action full of plot twists and unwasted scenes
Dec 27 2018,positive,the best mi to date wasnt disappointed in the least and i was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning wonderfully done
Dec 27 2018,positive,each movie surpasses the other every time the best one yet
Dec 27 2018,positive,one of the best action films of recent years
Dec 27 2018,positive,i had such high hopes after the previous installment rogue nation but this one fell flat while at times enjoyable the story was meh
Dec 26 2018,positive,i havent watched all the previous mission impossible films leaving me wondering whether or not i would be able to still enjoy the film i am glad i did the action was great and only benefited from a compelling story with some good twists it was sometimes predictable but still entertaining
Dec 26 2018,positive,amazing action tom cruise made this a great series and it just gets better
Dec 26 2018,positive,it was a very exciting and fast paced movie i think im just bitter about the ending but overall a good movie
Dec 26 2018,positive,this movie was insane if you are a fan of the mi movies tom cruse or hell action movies in general this movie is a must see but pay attention as the details make or break this movie if you fall asleep or only pay attention to the action you will be amused but confused so again pay attention this movie is worth giving 100 of your attention to 45 out of 5
Dec 26 2018,negative,can a movie get more inane written for 8 year olds with awful acting  action sequence after action sequence with ridiculous short interludes to make up another reason for a chase  i found myself looking at my watch hoping this abomination would soon be over my 24 year old daughter fell asleep it boggles the mind that some people were entertained it should have a warning label no thinking required no thinking expected
Dec 26 2018,positive,fun and exciting mission impossible  fallout is one of the best action movies of the year even though i have not watched the previous films to fully understand their plot
Dec 25 2018,positive,good movie but getting old
Dec 25 2018,positive,i have to say i have not been a great fan of the mission impossible movies sure theres plenty of action and cool stunts but i do not feel they follow the spirit of the tvshow in the tvshow they got their mission and then they completed it tricking the bad guys with the full backing of the imf team no political bullshit betrayal of the team and such like nonsense    however in pretty much every movie ethan or the entire imf team was betrayed or set up and he had to not only complete his mission but clear imf from whatever shenanigans the story writers had dreamed up the movies have been mission impossible in name only i wonder if the moron script writers has ever watched the show    in this movie too there is indeed a bunch of political nonsense and betrayal shit that i could be without but at least imf and ethans team are on his side throughout the movie there are also a few clever parts where they trick the bad guys in a good old fashioned mission impossible style    otherwise the movie is mostly a classical hollywood action adventurethriller movie plenty of more or less non stop action there are a few of the usual wtf story holes and defiance of physics when it comes to the stunts of course the dumbass cia director was a completely unnecessary element though    still overall i found this installment in the franchise to be one of the better ones maybe even the best one yet
Dec 24 2018,positive,pretty good movie though at this point its difficult to differentiate which mi plot segment belongs to which movie
Dec 24 2018,positive,always been a fan of this series always action packed and entertaining
Dec 24 2018,positive,its ok as expected entertaining well done full of action i hope they stop before it starts to fall out of minimum acceptable standards for movie making
Dec 23 2018,positive,this movie puts you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene and doesnt let you breath until the end credits roll easily the best action movie i have seen since mad max fury road in 2015
Dec 23 2018,positive,one of the best action movies i have ever seen the filmmakers have mastered the art of exciting action insane stunts and gripping can they do it scenes
Dec 23 2018,positive,kept me entertained and felt like i wasnt waisting my time only complaint is how the close calls only come down to 1 second being left overall the movie didnt make wanna do something stupidlike setting myself on fire im actually very thankful for that
Dec 23 2018,positive,best one yet the bathroom fight scene and the final fight are must watch
Dec 23 2018,positive,what it lacks in believability it makes up for in how freakin awesome it all is as a series with so many sequels they somehow manage to grasp my attention and get me so involved that i dont realize when i shout or yell in accordance to whats going on in the movie  all the cast members have great chemistry together and provide some good ol fashioned comedic relief when its needed
Dec 22 2018,positive,delightful unstoppable and fun adventure the ending could be a little shorter but overall one of the best entries on the mi saga
Dec 22 2018,positive,amazing movie hope they continue to make more in the series
Dec 22 2018,positive,phenomenal action set pieces
Dec 21 2018,positive,this movie didnt only have consistance on its action part but it has also a good way of showing how sometimes people cant be together just for the greater good i see something really deep in ethan and julias relationship some directors would make it feels like a cheesy romantic scene but i gotta say mcquarrie did a really great job making it the deepest romantic scene when ethan was alone with julia
Dec 21 2018,positive,best mi by far a bit predictable but the action scenes are fantastic
Dec 21 2018,negative,action movie with no scenario
Dec 21 2018,positive,fun to watch went in with no expectations came away happy
Dec 21 2018,positive,flawless best film of the year
Dec 21 2018,positive,this is a solid action movie good all around  the only problem i had was that rebecca ferguson  and  michelle monaghan look so similar that i got a bit confused around the end when they each had scenes separately
Dec 21 2018,positive,this movie is amazing
Dec 21 2018,positive,this series needs to end fighting scenes were coolthis movie was impossible without the missioncruise you old 
Dec 20 2018,positive,one good action sequence after the next in fact a bit too many
Dec 20 2018,positive,as is usual with the mi movies masterful in plot and actioneven despite heavy technology in this one
Dec 20 2018,positive,amazing action and great fun it will have you on the edge of your seat
Dec 20 2018,neutral,the stunts and locations are some of the best ever put to film the action is top notch yet i dont feel the presence of absurd impossibility of the mission lke i felt in rogue nation and ghost protocol 
Dec 20 2018,positive,easily the best action movie ever made i didnt see the other mission impossible movies but that wasnt a problem i was hooked throughout the entire thing each action sequence is very well done tom cruise still has it in him when it comes to running and doing his own stunts a must see definitely will watch previous parts with boxxy software
Dec 20 2018,positive,good lord tom might be a little unhinged in real life but that works to his benefit in this excellent action movie best action movie i saw this year
Dec 19 2018,positive,i enjoy all the mission impossible movies its great as the rest would like to see the love interest between tom cruise and rebecca ferguson 
Dec 19 2018,negative,lazy rehash filled with homage actors and cliche characters
Dec 19 2018,positive,it is quite obvious that the producers came up with 3 amazing action scenes and wrote the script around them but that doesnt make anything in this movie less impressive 
Dec 19 2018,positive,weve seen this storyline a million times before but the awesome special effects and stunts make it worth the price of admission
Dec 18 2018,positive,as expected the action sequences in mission impossible fallout are quite impressive however the overly complicated story bogs the movie down and it relies too heavily on the plot points of previous mission impossible films nevertheless this is still an entertaining ride
Dec 18 2018,negative,same as all the other mission impossible movies there is a bad guy who wants to destroy here comes the team and disarms a bomb at the very last minute mission impossible movies should be dead by now how many are they going to make
Dec 17 2018,positive,after seeing this movie i thought that it was full of action i could tell this just from the title with the word mission that it was going to be full of action because missions tend to have a lot of action in it     although it is an action film it is a big cliche movie because you can predict a lot that happens but there are some things that did surprise me and i did not see them coming at all some of the things that happened would never happen in real life unless you had the best luck in the world    all of the action scenes in the movie all looked amazing especially with the car chases and the helicopter chase    i did not really like the story line of the movie a mission goes wrong and they have to save it but finding big bombs that can destroy and kill a lot of people but they do have a significant reason this movie also has humour and jokes in it which sounds very real and they do not overdo it at all    overall i did like this movie and i would rate it 355 stars because it has a lot of action but i feel like there is too much action
Dec 17 2018,neutral,my opinion on mission impossible fallout was that it was very unrealistic in some of the action scenei thought the acting and the effects were really good but the story line was a bit boring and the same as every other action filmthe mise en scene in the film has a lot of different visual imagery it was very pleasing to watch as the sound went well with the action and acting in the film it also had low key lighting throughout the film i thought the performance from the actors was great with some amazing stunt scenes i did find the storyline to have too many plot twists but was very predictable and the film did drag on more than it needed to the good this about this film is that it doesnt really matter if youve watched any of the other mission impossible films and is very easy to pick up and understand whats going on action isnt my favorite genre which is probably why i didnt enjoy this film to much as i found it very long and quite boring but if your a fan of of the action genre then you will most likely enjoy this film
Dec 17 2018,positive,i really liked this film and all the other ones i give it a 45 stars out of 5 one of the main reasons this film is because it was jam packed with epic moments and fight scenes my favourite part of the film was the ending and the reason for that is because it was the most jaw dropping part of the film
Dec 17 2018,positive,the action scenes were really well choreographed but the rest of the movie wasnt of the same quality
Dec 16 2018,positive,outstanding    thank you for making an action movie with a soul  the practical effects and exotic locals set this movie lightyears ahead of the garbage we are fed in for example the star wars franchise     also having the main actor do most of his own stunts makes this movie a true marvel
Dec 16 2018,negative,not impressed given its not my favorite genre of film but i found it boring and too long
Dec 16 2018,positive,loved it saw it in imax 3d and it was worth every penny great action great acting fantastic special effects
Dec 16 2018,positive,another damn fine thrilling intense mission impossible movie they never disappoint its loads of fun and actually had me on the edge of my seat for many sequences was also very appreciated that they were able to wrap up the relationship story as long as tom cruise can keep up keep em coming
Dec 15 2018,positive,impossible mission  fallout   12 is a film without major mistakes has excessive exposure and a little more screen time than it should have but has many good action scenes not to mention the scenes of persecution one of the best action movies of the year
Dec 15 2018,positive,this movie is action at its best  it was great to see henry cavill tear into a meaty role  i hope he gets another shot at a superman movie that is allowed to breathe
Dec 15 2018,positive,i love all the mi movies but fallout is far and away the best yet i was literally on the edge of my seat for the entire movie
Dec 15 2018,positive,best mission impossible yet action packed the whole way through if you liked the other movies youll like this one because its even better
Dec 14 2018,positive,i am going to make a very bold statement  that a lot of people are going to argue with me on but i stand behind it    mission impossible  fallout  is the best action movie ever made  period without a doubt    from start to finish  which is over 2 hours this movie will grip you and not let go there is literally nothing i can pick apart in this film as act by act the pacing story line and action pieces flow so perfectly  that they are nothing short of perfection meticulously crafted choreographed and shot they are a visual adrenaline rush and need to be seen in imax    for his 6th go around as imf agent ethan hunt cruise somehow ups the ante and seems hell bent on creating a cinematic experience that wont be forgotten i had the privilege of watching this with a great crowd in a packed theatre and after several action pieces people were clapping and cheering thats how good he is  his ï 12iï 12tmll thrill you or die tryingï 12 attitude makes this one of the most perfectly conceived blockbusters in recent memory    cast members from mi old come in throughout for support and give this a great deja vu feeling but the real stand out is easily henry cavill cold blooded heavy handed and without remorse  he is fking awesome in this movie as a cia agent sent to chaperone hunt i wont spoil anything but a particular bathroom scene highlights why cavill is a pure badass and how he can be a big action star outside of his superman role    i could go on and on about a million things i enjoyed  as director christopher mcquarries directing cinematographer rob hardy s incredible way of capturing action and lorne balfes methodical and tense score make this for the best movie of the summer  go see this    grade  a 
Dec 14 2018,positive,verg good plot good acting includes tom cruise action packed
Dec 14 2018,positive,not a real tom cruise  offscreen  fan but i like this series great ending to the series toms getting a bit too old for the stunts and it shows but its true to the character who is aging as well  time for this one to retire however the movie was action packed and did an awesome job referencing past mission impossible movies with the current imf team
Dec 14 2018,neutral,it took me a couple trys to actually watch it i loose interest pretty quick same old same old same old bore me to tears its time to end this series
Dec 14 2018,positive,just a another action movie dont expect the so called greatest action movie ever
Dec 12 2018,positive,this is the greatest actionspy film of all time yes i still perfer bond but this movie and tom cruise is killer the net action film i see where the hero is in front of a screen with cgi is going to suck those shots of cruise in the helicopter where something else
Dec 12 2018,negative,this sequel just doesnt deliver for me this is the sequel where we say  enough is enough and a bridge too far and jump the shark and all those cliches and its too bad because the last mi was quite good but with this current entry the franchise has veered into pure action for the sake of action without wasting much time on story or character development my wife and i agreed the story is disjointed the dialogue is odd and unexpected things happen at unexpected times usually i suppose just for the sake of keeping the action going       its hard for us to take alec baldwin seriously       i guess in the final analysis some of us need plot to drive a movie and some of us need only motorcycles to do that
Dec 11 2018,positive,best movie in the franchise the action scenes was awesome and the villain was great
Dec 11 2018,positive,regular movie and entertaining
Dec 11 2018,positive,even at 56 he can pull of a shownormallymovie franchises having more than 3 movies under its belt diminishes in quality but this action franchise is still going strong this shows the longevity of a simple spy narrative can rise up with new ideas the characters in the movie are well versed in their roles  with a few exceptions of the extras but no one watches this movie for its characters rather for its action and a finalealthough a few plot twists  can be expectedas well as the ending it does not take away your interest elsewherei am in awe of the paragliding scene  and the sheer intensity of the scene even though the outcome is expected
Dec 11 2018,positive,2018128 dad wanted to watch this so we watched together the view was phenomenal and the style was so comic
Dec 11 2018,positive,its a movie that makes me happy until the end
Dec 10 2018,positive,the older tom cruise gets the less time there is between his mission impossible sequels there was a mere four years between the first and second installments and it seemed that might be the end of things but six years later when tom cruise needed a public face lift it was ethan hunt who was called on to come to the rescue five years passed and the series reinvigorated itself with brad birds franchisebest ghost protocol and then four years passed before writerdirector christopher mcquarrie took over and teamed with cruise to produce the worthy followup that was rogue nation now only three years have passed between the last and what is now the sixth installment in this everexpanding action franchise i can only imagine that well have another mission impossible movie by 2020 at which point mr cruise will be fiftyeight yearsold it is not only cruises age that splinters the race against time these movies will become though but also the fact the onetime biggest movie star on the planet is hardpressed to find success elsewhere outside the franchise this creates questions of what might cruise do once hes no longer able to jump out of airplanes scale mountains or fly helicopters but these are questions more curious than they are concerning for now audiences should simply revel in the fact cruise can still accomplish what he has in order to bring fallout to the biggest screen everwhich is where you should see it mission impossible  fallout is the pinnacle of what it seems this entire series knowing or unknowingly has been leading to it is mcquarries the dark knight it is cruises commitment to celluloid that will define the middle act of his career and it is by far one of the best action movies ever made yes fallout is everything a fan of the previous films could want in that it revolves around a convoluted plot of double crossings and inconspicuous baddies throwing obstacles at our beloved team of core heroes but what elevates this latest entry above many of the others is the way in which it caps off this trilogy of sorts that began with ghost protocol where these movies werent just using cruises hunt as a conduit for action or trying to humanize him but more discover the person hunt actually is while detailing his journey to figure out who he truly wants to be fallout is as much a coming to terms and peace with who the character is for ethan hunt as it is a clarification on the haze that still tinged who hunt was over the last few films how this will affect future installments will remain to be seen but as the core of fallout it only adds substantial weight to a movie that excels in every other facet of the genre it is excited to exist within    read the whole review at 
Dec 10 2018,positive,now dont get me wrong this is a very good action film it just has a few issues i will go on to  as im sure you all know the mission impossible franchise this is the sixth entry follows the antics of the imf a sort of private intelligence organization which to the intelligence community seems like the eu army to nato using a donald trump like analogy the film interestingly stars trump adversary alec baldwin  the film has great stunt work some of which are noticeably performed by star tom cruise himself one particularly painful stunt landed cruise with an injury that halted filming for a while the stunt makes the final cut the pain is there to see  however the action sequences have been seen before in other films most noticeably the james bond franchise  i lost count of the number of times i said to my wife who was also watching ive seen this before in such and such or wait for the scuba divers to rescue the guy locked in a security vehicle which has been rammed into a river  i am trying not to make my liking of the bond films effect my review but it is difficult at times  the story is a little complicated but the action keeps your attention span and director christopher mcquarrie paces the film well the film has a two and a half hour run time which passes very quickly  spy film aficionados will also take note of the casting of henry cavill as cia agent august walker cavill was cast in spy film the man from uncle in 2015  director christopher mcquarrie directed the last mission impossible entry rogue nation back in 2015 so comes with experience  talking of experience the crew are veterans or the next generation of bond film veterans here he goes again  i thoroughly enjoyed the film despite my picky protestations above
Dec 9 2018,positive,ive enjoyed the mission impossible franchise since its beginning and if this film was the grand finale i would be happy thoroughly enjoyable base action written to be enjoyed beginning to end
Dec 9 2018,positive,although it does not bring anything we have not already seen mission impossiblefallout brings a simple story in its beginning that causes the viewer to be surprised with the plot twists that are revealing as the film unfolds action scenes who are cool to see thus bringing the tradition of the films of the saga in the end the movie is fun to watch and at the same time leaves those who watch tense by the several scenes in which almost everything goes by water down
Dec 9 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout review 8510 i want to start by saying ive never really been a mission impossible fan but rouge nation i thought was good and refreshing for the franchise and fallout keeps the trend going upwards of course by getting bigger than the previous installment fast paced stylish and vastly entertaining this is not only a reminder of how insane tom cruises dedication to delivering big screen thrills is but also a prime example of how movies are originally meant to be watched on the big screen christopher mcquarrie makes fallout feels a lot like the first mission impossiblemovie than any other film in the franchise but also cleverly takes everything good about the franchise and marinates it all into one movie the stunts staged with vigor and a sharp eye for spatial balance by writerdirector christopher mcquarrie grow wilder as fallout goes on and admittedly theyre a hoot cruise brings a work ethic as solid as the movies narrative ethic is hectic generously and subtly conducting an outstanding supporting cast that includes mi veterans ving rhames simon pegg rebecca ferguson and alec baldwin some of fallouts most delicious scenes though feature cruise and vanessa kirby leaving behind her princess margaret persona from the crown to play a fascinatingly saucy minx of indistinct motivation mcquarrie finally asks what sort of man keeps accepting those missions what drives someone to put their life on the line again and again for hunt the answer is simple he can save people and therefore he has a responsibility to act for cruise  and mcquarrie  its an eternal quest to outdo the last effort theyre only making the next one difficult by succeeding this hard
Dec 9 2018,positive,the best movie on the series in my opinion  loved it so much  the characters were well build the plot was very interesting unexpected and moving and the twists were great  i think this is one of the best action films in the past few years
Dec 8 2018,negative,did not meet my expectations at all cannot believe scores as high as they are dialogue suspense just seemed forced and ridiculous appreciate coen bros movies homeland ray donovan etc even more ridiculous on every level
Dec 8 2018,positive,one of the best action movies by far this year
Dec 8 2018,negative,same old thing i was bored
Dec 8 2018,neutral,did not enjoy too long cliched and boring
Dec 8 2018,positive,one of the best action films of the year and i think the best mission impossible picture in the franchise tom cruise has aged a bit but still likes to show off his ability to do the stunts henry cavill makes a good addition this time around the action sequences are fast and furious making very few lulls  it is a bit longer than in needs to be however the ticking time bomb near the end is set at 15 minutes yet it takes about a half hour for that to be reached still a great piece of blockbuster entertainment
Dec 8 2018,positive,was an amazing non stop action movie i guess it was my fault that i was actually expecting a story
Dec 7 2018,positive,an excellent thriller ride with tons of action  as weve come to expect from the mi franchise this instalment was loaded with great chase scenes awesome fight sequences and obviously a very close call  tom cruise does great as ethan hunt and his supporting cast come through too  if youre a fan of the previous iterations especially rogue nation as this continues that storyline then youre in for a good time here
Dec 7 2018,positive,directorwriter christopher mcquarrie helms this big hollywood effort like a proboxer in his prime on the attack and hes not pulling any punches in a world of big cgi superhero productions he presents a response that effectively embraces oldschool actioners and everyone onscreen gets their shot in the ring from the streets of paris to the mountains of kashmir we get crash boom bang movie style thrills biggerthanlifeand yet somehow wo a connection to it thats the only drawback this is a rollicking big fun movie
Dec 7 2018,positive,i saw this because i ran into simon pegg in the capitol and he said he was there for the premiere of the movie  it was well made and had a compelling story despite some of the cgi
Dec 7 2018,positive,these are honestly the best action movies in existence the fight scenes intense action and story line were incredible loved this movie
Dec 6 2018,negative,not that great  it was average typical mission impossible  plot was predictable  it seemed disjointed and put together in parts
Dec 6 2018,positive,i think this is my favorite out of all the mi movies it was great 
Dec 6 2018,positive,every movie needs a superman sized pair of reloading arms so fun and energetic
Dec 6 2018,positive,i loved this movie it was amazing once i saw the trailer i knew it would be good
Dec 6 2018,positive,insane set pieces great action good comedy thats not over done and we see tom cruise break his ankle basically everything you want from an action film
Dec 6 2018,negative,aweful movie i am blown away by the ratings for this and am skeptical the votes are being coerced  i didnt mind the other installments of mi but this one was contrived crap that took anything remotely believable and threw it out the window to try and help tom cruise continue his one dimensional action heroism well into his 50s the only thing more painful than watching this was watching toms heavily botoxed face try and show emotion
Dec 6 2018,positive,that mustache was definitely worth ruining justice league great movie on boxxy software
Dec 6 2018,positive,122018 plane to manila very entertaining 
Dec 5 2018,negative,same predictable formula same action same cast same friggin movie but somehow much much worse this movie is so bad it almost makes rebecca ferguson unattractive to me  almost
Dec 5 2018,positive,the end of the movie drags but fallout contains the most exciting sequences in the mi franchise
Dec 5 2018,negative,not anywhere near the level id come to expect from this bunch if i were twelve id have known the television broadcast for the scientists benefit was a put on how he a supposed genius didnt makes no sense in fact too much of this makes no sense and we are asked to overlook it all just too over look the next mess blechh i need smart i need sharp i need fast i get none of them here ï 12ï 12
Dec 5 2018,positive,sets a new standard once again even over the last one this thing was amazing to watch i think even better on second  third viewing
Dec 5 2018,positive,this was one awesome mission impossible experience tom cruise is flawless again just what i expected and more an edge of my seat thrill ride full of never before done stunts painful looking fights thoughtful acting a twisting story and a thumping score loved everything about mi fallout  but most of all we get that ian hunt starewhat is he thinking what will he do next watch it rent it enjoy it
Dec 4 2018,positive,yet another mission impossible movieand still tom cruise is putting out great stuff  loved it
Dec 4 2018,neutral,this feels more like a flick that was written by a 10yearold who thinks this is how a mission impossible movie is supposed to be    the constant plot twists in the middle of the movie to prevent predictability makes it lose all sense of believeability and the stereotype of the bad guy blatantly revealing his plot cmon why always the same thing    as a conclusion the characters all laugh at the end at how they were only 2 seconds away from a complete destruction of civilization through whatever is the predominant issue of the day is nuclear weapons climate change biological weapons terrorism    basically laughing at the license to print money at plots that are just rinsed and repeated over and over    this was probably the dumbest most cliche mission impossible thus far
Dec 4 2018,positive,spoilers ahead if you havent seen it and feel like you need to read this review you should see the film and decide for yourself  action doesnt begin to describe this film nothing ever slows down in mission impossible   fallout and thats what makes it appealing the story has been done before  bad guy with a bomb good guys need to find and stop him but this new version of the overused tale adds a few twists i never saw coming  the scene with cnns wolf blitzer one of many the twists eventually get confusing potentially too confusing for some so maybe bring a bit of paper to write down how many doublecrossings and undoublecrossings there are and keep track of who is on whos side  endings of most spy films are no surprise  same here  but its the ride that takes us there  that makes this film worth watching
Dec 4 2018,positive,amazing visualsperformances and twists the best mission impossible entry yet
Dec 4 2018,positive,action movie of the year in 2018 and the best of the series
Dec 4 2018,positive,i would of given this 5 stars but i dislike the director  he usually ruins movies but i was glad to see that tom cruise kept him inline on this one  abrams is a franchise killer as far as fan fervor goes
Dec 4 2018,positive,with outstanding stunts and characters this movie stands out even if it feels a little dragged on as the storyline still has some twist and creates a feeling of wanting more mindblowing stunts a
Dec 3 2018,positive,for me the best movie in 2k18 so far
Dec 3 2018,positive,unrealistic but amazing stunts and a lot of exciting action
Dec 2 2018,positive,my full opinion 9310
Dec 2 2018,positive,wonderful fun great actingthank you mr cruise for your passion 
Dec 2 2018,positive,from the very beginning  the pedal was on the gas   and it didnt letup until the very last frame  one of my favorite films from this year so far
Dec 2 2018,positive,movie night with iris    this is riproaring fun and an unashamed gem the mission impossible films dont have any hangups about cannon its spectacular action pieces that seem rooted in realism i remember nowt about the previous five and it just doesnt matter the plots wafer thin but it doesnt matter you get the gist    henry cavill is a great lovehate bromance then evil foe indeed its one of those films in which heroes and villains are continually blurred we are never sure who is trying to kill ethan who is trying to help him and who is simply there for the money    so chill and enjoy the set pieces there are too many to mention the standoff in a car park brutal fight sequence in the gents a riveting motorbike chase through the streets of paris a  rooftop chase from st pauls cathedral to the tate modern helicopter battle and a clifftop climax    invigorating viewing just wish wed had more of the theme tune
Dec 2 2018,positive,610  there is no new spy tech tool like other mi series cliche plot
Dec 2 2018,negative,same old formula  sub standard acting
Dec 1 2018,positive,how the hell do you make it to a sixth movie and still not suck especially seeing how this movie was breaking tradition by keeping ethan hunt with short hair and having the same director from the last movie thats a meta crowning moment of awesome if there ever was one though i still consider ghost protocol to be my favourite fallout is still amazing the action scenes and set pieces are thrilling as always tom cruises performance is great and theres a fair amount of funny moments even with the movie being darker than the other mi movies in short mission impossible  fallout acoomplishes the impossible mission of being a fifth sequel and still being good rather than finally succumbing to the law of diminishing returns
Nov 30 2018,positive,an amazing action movie tom cruises stunts are absolutely amazing arguably the best movie of 2018 i love it
Nov 30 2018,negative,tom cruise shouldve given up acting a looooong time ago  he looks like botox patient and cant even move his face anymore  i give this a chance with my moviepass and im sorry i wasted my time
Nov 30 2018,negative,too many chase scenes packed into one film
Nov 30 2018,positive,wow stunning movie 5 star all the way
Nov 29 2018,positive,this is one of the best movies on this franchise tom cruise is insane in this one with his stunts lol lot of well thought plot twists great action scenes and very compeeling story and progression in general
Nov 29 2018,positive,hollywoods most consistently entertaining franchise churns out another winner what started out as an auteurdriven james bond has evolved into a consistent blockbuster factory starting with 2011s ghost protocol tom cruise and his mi filmmakers found a very satisfying formula for delivering summer thrills and fallout might be the best version yet dont expect anything revolutionary or new thats not what this is about what you will get is another uptempo dazzling rollercoaster full of beautiful people doing incredible things you might poke holes in the plot or roll your eyes at some of the more predictable twists but youll still enjoy every minute of it the craftsmanship is such that chris mcquarrie and company managed to keep me on the edge of my seat during the climactic chase sequence even when i know damn well what the eventual outcome will be they should keep making these for as long as tom cruise can still look good running
Nov 29 2018,negative,unoriginal story lots of unoriginal action
Nov 28 2018,positive,action overkill i like action but there needs to some separation between action sequences it would have been pretty entertaining to me if theyd not overdone the action parts it eventually gets boring with one last second literally escape after another  losing the plutonium was stupid in the first place if they are supposed to so aware of their surroundings
Nov 27 2018,neutral,pros  action scenes are great    cons   the trailers gave away too much of the movie knew what was gonna happen before it did
Nov 27 2018,positive,outstanding it will keep you on edge and off your chair should watch it well directed music is strong sound editing is strong action scenes are strong rebecca is strong watch it
Nov 26 2018,negative,enough with the inception zimmer like music that we have to hear in too many recent movies as to the  film itself i would much rather watch the original tv series
Nov 25 2018,positive,sleek taut and smart a delight to watch mission impossible continues to impressi
Nov 24 2018,positive,brilliant movie cruise at his best love it  need more 
Nov 24 2018,negative,every single character is a double or triple agent with a secret agenda making the story a convoluted mess of who gives a shit
Nov 24 2018,positive,this is truly the perfect spy movie sweeping set pieces breakneck pace jaw dropping stunts its all there i could watch this movie a million times and never get tired of it this deserves any and all hype it gets
Nov 23 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is a nearly perfect action movie the stunts live up to the hype the action sequences are clear and purposeful and the twists and turns are a load of fun directing editing and pacing is symphonic a bars been set high for modern filmmakers a
Nov 22 2018,positive,just when you think this franchise cant get better tom cruise takes ethan hunt on another exhilarating ride better than the last this latest installment to the classic action franchise grants its audience exactly what they hope to see in a mission impossible film and thats a new way to test the true definition of the word impossible with topnotch action scenes and some insanely incredible stunts this blockbuster is fast fun and absolutely fantastic
Nov 22 2018,positive,by far the best mi installment to date buy it
Nov 22 2018,positive,non stop action good twists and turns and an intense edge of your seat finish
Nov 20 2018,positive,the story is kind of hard to follow but the action sequences made up the flews
Nov 19 2018,positive,1118 2018  the entertainment value for exactly the reason why we watched the movie is way up there for me too bad my partner does not seem to agree with it well if there is one movie who can get away with the impossible this franchise surely is it
Nov 19 2018,positive,it is a really good movie it was really well thought out i also thought that some of the fight scenes were really intense and amazing it is a realy great movie if you loved the other mission impossible moives this is one for you
Nov 19 2018,positive,it was long good but long but it makes you wonder how many times the world could end and its always the same guy that saves in litteraly the last second but i shouldnt complain if he keeps this standard he sure can make another one and i will watch it
Nov 19 2018,positive,plot was overly confusing and redundant towards end
Nov 19 2018,positive,the best in the series for me fast paced fun and really exiting with a great villain by henry cavill an awesome follow up to rogue nation
Nov 19 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout was an action packed thriller it was interesting and awesome the stunts that were performed in  dthis film were amazing and the acting was great tom cruise played his role and he done a great job as usual there were a few different cities that were used to film in london kashmer and paris this shows how much time was put into this wonderful movie in my opinion it was one of the best mission impossible movies i have seen and its going to be a hard one to top there is a scene around the start of the movie where ethan and walker skydive down walker was struck by a lightning bolt and the scene looked amazing the sound was spectacular and incredibly realistic the special effects were also on point the lighting varied due to different day times in the movie majority of the scenes were shot during the day time with the sun shining other parts were shot at nightime the final scene in the movie was incredible as the scene was gruesome and exiting    there were a lot of plot twists throughout the movie and a lot of unexpected scenes out of 5 stars i would give this wonderful movie a 45 out of 5 it was an exceptional film however i think if the crew behind this film can definitely top it
Nov 18 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is one of the best action movies of the year and maybe one of the best of alltime the many vehicles in the movie eg the fast cars  motorcycles and helicopters make the movie stand out when it comes to action the several cities they visit in the film eg london paris and kashmir make the movie more attractive as these places have good  landscapes and landmarks i think the sound in movie was superb as it was used at the right time to build up suspense especially in fight scenes i also really enjoyed the mission impossible theme that was going on through the movie as it sounded really nice i think the performances in the movie were great tom cruises performance  as ethan hunt in the action thriller stands out as earlier in the movie when he saves luther this told me that he really cares about the people that are close to him and he wouldnt trade the life of someone he really cares about with the lives of  millions of strangers the supporting cast also have great performances rebecca ferguson as ilsa faust an agent who has similar motives with ethan but their past relationship  gets both of them tangled up in their missions henry cavill has a stellar performance as august walker john lark is a cia  assassin whos mission is to keep an eye on hunt and his team theres a great plot twist as if walker is really cooperating with hunt or trying to take him down as a double agent ving rhames as luther stickell is more of the heart of the team who cares a lot for ethan and also has some comedic moments simon pegg  as benji dunn is more of the tech wizz in the team who also ethan cares a lot about he has several comedic moments throughout  the film and is one of the core members of the team
Nov 18 2018,neutral,i wast a huge fan of this film the reason for this  is because i am not a huge fan of that particular genre of film and it wouldnt be a feel that i would go and see willingly if i was not watching it as part of  my college course i also thought that the plot of the film was really hard to follow as there were so many difffrent things going on although i thought that all of  the stunts that were performed on this film were really impresssive i also thought that the way that they ise audio in this film was reall effective because it fitted in with what ever was going on in a particular scene  i thought that the way that cut inbetween scenes was really smooth     to conclude i would say that  i would  revomend this film to people that i know that love to watch action films   otherwise i would not recomend
Nov 17 2018,positive,probably among the best action movies of 2010s
Nov 17 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout i thought that the story line was very good it kept me interested throughout the whole film  even though i have never seen any of the previous films the story line in the film was easy to get ahold of and allowed me to get to grips with what is happening  the use of sound effects made the film seem very intense and realistic to what you was watching  the use of different camera angles and clever editing made the film much very gripping on its own there is not a boring moment throughout the whole film     the mise en scene in the film has a wide range of differences for example some parts of the movie are set in major capitals of the world such as london and paris but towards the end of the film in the helicopter fight scene  it is set within the outskirts of china within the snowy mountains    the costume worn within the film make it easy to know who is who  for example ethan hunt played by tom cruise is shown wearing a suit at the start of the film so we know he is an important character to the story also the suit hints that he may be james bond style character which we soon find out he is
Nov 16 2018,positive,mission impossible franchise is getting better and better even better than the last movie with some awesome action and a interesting plot all the characters are flushed out well and has a solid story great movie
Nov 16 2018,positive,i thought the film was very good and the storyline was very capturing and i was constantly focused on what was happening but i do have to admit i wasnt really that focused on the types of angles or shots because i was just watching what was happening and i was trying to work out the plot in my head of whos done this and who hasnt but i do remember they used a lot of mid shots where it would either pan side to side or it would follow the actors actress along they do this because they want your eyes to focus on certain things for example when solomon lane is in the helicopter they want you to focus on him because he is going to be a main part of the story something else the directors do a lot is a tracking shot where they follow certain characters around to make it look like your with them so you feel like your apart of the story which entices the audience more another shot the directors used a lot is a long shot on bits of the film that are suspenseful because they can create a tense atmosphere if it was used right and it was definitely used the right way in this film
Nov 16 2018,positive,whilst watching this film for part of my creative media course at college this is what i observed in mission impossible fallout  the cinematography of the movie is that there was some good camera work of zooming in and out at the right moments with all the visual effects going on throughout the film to draw me in i believe during this film they have not to appeared to be many green screen shots from watching all the stunts that tom cruise has done as well as it being very suspenseful from the cuts from scenes which have been moved quickly from one to another so there is no dull moments in the film     the miseenscene of the film is that there is a range of interesting settings of all major city for example london and paris there is also a lot of typical secret agent outfits for example suits the lighting plays a huge part in this film because it changes with the mood of the scene creating an atmosphere as well as the colour of the surroundings the camera angles have also created an interesting effect on the film because every scene it has work well will because of how many camera angles there have to make you feel happy tension or afraid for example watching tom cruiseï 12tms character ethan hunt jump from the plane you see him from below then above and constantly changing       all round i think the movie was made well and is a great watch for people who enjoy action movies
Nov 15 2018,positive,best yet my favourite entry in the series so far 1010
Nov 15 2018,positive,other than actions you still see the unbeatable tom running chasing around which took up half of the total running time 
Nov 14 2018,positive,this is quite possibly the strongest mission impossible film to date thus far with incredible set pieces jawdropping stunt work and unexpected twists and turns this is one hell of a summer blockbuster
Nov 13 2018,positive,it hits a few familiar notes but never drops its pace and shows off its brilliant action scenes and great actors and we are starting to see more character depth in a typically shallow action hero
Nov 13 2018,positive,one of the best entries in the series mission impossible  fallout delivers a thrilling actionpacked adventure  when ethan hunt and his team fail to recover a case of nuclear material theyre forced to use an old adversary to get it back  the first direct sequel of the series the film does a good job at continuing and building on the characters and themes from rogue nation  and the fight scenes and chases are exciting and full of energy  however the plots a bit convoluted as times and some of the performances are a little lackluster  yet while it has a few rough spots mission impossible  fallout is a highadrenaline spy thriller thats incredibly entertaining
Nov 11 2018,positive,do i really need to write a review for this movie i do not think so have you ever seen a mi if the answer is yes you know what you will watch for the next 2h and 30m if not let me break it down for you explosions fights ton on a motorcycle tom going up buildings people wearing masks of other people countdowns and a very lucky happy ending some are better some are worse this is better
Nov 11 2018,positive,brilliant 100 certified fresh
Nov 10 2018,positive,a nearperfect action film this is one of the best of the year where the action excels and the story is deep and compelling the performances are onpoint with not a singleperson feeling out of place this is a thoroughly entertaining film and i believe will stand as one of the greatest spy films of all time
Nov 9 2018,positive,im not usually a big fan of mission impossible movies because they are so full of really impossible stuff but even though it was the case again i quite enjoyed this long one chase scenes and the last part of the helicopter scene were amazing
Nov 9 2018,negative,ridiculously cliche with a highly telegraphed plot and fastcut action shots that obliterate any sense of tension or appreciation for whats going on
Nov 7 2018,positive,mission impossiblefallout is one of the best action movies that ever made his plot is interesting makes us love the movie from the beginning to the end and his incredible action scenes and his tacky twist plot but it makes the movie more interesting for some reason
Nov 7 2018,negative,this movie is boring and shallow a mess couldnt finish it you muricans are getting dumber and dumber seriously or did the producers buy bunch of indian guys to review it favourably
Nov 6 2018,positive,absolutely the best of all the mi movies and a great movie alone
Nov 5 2018,positive,the best action movie ive seen in a very long time due to tom cruises insane amount of dedication and its fun and actionpacked pace mission impossible  fallout is definitely the number one blockbuster of the year
Nov 5 2018,positive,finallysome decent action film
Nov 4 2018,positive,holy smokes what a ride that helicopter chase alone was worth it the storyline barely existed but at this point these scripts write themselves and we wont hold it against them will we fantastic achievement in action cinema to be watched on as big a screen as you can find
Nov 4 2018,positive,its whole lotta fun but i dont think its that goodits better than a clichestereotype spyaction movie but ynowits not one of the best movies of all time
Nov 3 2018,positive,knows what it is doesnt take itself too seriously but still manage to put a shiteating grin on my face and is a mighty fun time at the theaters  watching it in dbox 3d upped the experience
Nov 3 2018,positive,incredible movie it was one of those few that i wound up chasing all over the state of california as it left one theater but remained at another because i wanted to catch every movie showing of it that i could i had watched the rogue nation one in theaters over and over again and this time my sister joined me for fallout trying to catch multiple screenings on the big screen as exciting and thrilling as every action sequence was as mysterious and surprising as every plot twist or doublecrossing was what i appreciated the most about this movie was how much was subtly communicated by a mere raising of an eyebrow or barely a wink slight changes in facial expressions told so much perhaps its just me but when sloane describes walker as a hammer i wondered if he got his high position within the cia through some kind of sexual act but thats probably just my dirty mind there it took me a few viewings to catch every subtle nonspoken gesture but when i finally did the movie became even more entertaining when the imf are detaining both walker and solomon lane in cuffs and then walker nods just slightly towards solomon lane walker is reassuring lane that he has completely infiltrated the cia so nothing sloane has ordered will be carried through successfully when benji and luther are glaring angry at walker while cramped into the backseat of the tiny car it is because it is dawning on them that walker only secured a car big enough for 4 men not 5 because he expected ethan hunt wouldve been captured and arrested by that time framed as john lark then my favorite ethan asks julia if her husband eric knows who he is and julia quickly shakes her head no but as ethan and eric talk to eachother it becomes clear that eric does know who ethan is that eric has heard of ethan julia only denied that because she is trying to protect eric from the same danger that she and ethan have constantly found themselves in because of who ethan is at the end when ethan is in a hospital tent and eric advises ethan not to move and he tells him that sloane had arrived right in front of half the indian army he adds see you later doc and he winks at ethan its so quick dont blink or youll miss it eric is making it clear by that time he has figured out who ethan is in a few of the earlier scenes eric seems a little bit uncomfortable or he has a very concerned expression on his face but his concern is that ethans presence signals danger to himself and his wife he knows that enemies of ethan have tried to harm julia before no matter what draws you to this movie whether its the very dangerous action scenes the deathdefying stunts the love story the mystery and suspense it totally satisfies on all levels i also truly appreciate the messages regarding morality and empathy as always ethan hunt is a fearless boundless gentleman a total class act
Nov 1 2018,positive,another great movie in this franchise even with the most unbelievable helicopter scene of all time 
Oct 31 2018,positive,its good but i think the franchise is starting to flag a little the double double double crossing of the first half is rote and exhausting and only barely rescued by the full on action of the second i can wait for the next one
Oct 31 2018,positive,good movie thats it nothing innovations
Oct 30 2018,negative,not interesting bland if you have seen the other ones in the series then you have basically seen this one thumbs down for me terribleboringunoriginalnot funnyawful
Oct 30 2018,positive,omg this movie was action packed from beginning to the end it was excellent i missed the last two before this one but it all makes sense i enjoy watching tom cruise hes a very good actor in my opinion but you can tell hes getting old i recommend this movie
Oct 29 2018,positive,truly the best of the series great action amazing cinematography good acting worth a view from any action movie fan
Oct 28 2018,positive,a well executed and written action film up there with the best ive seen after all these years tom cruise still has it in many ways it was a homage to the action greats of the 80s and 90s a well paced well told story with spectacular cinematography actions sequences were a good mix of cgi and stunts which is rare for 2018 well worth the watch on the big screen and a follow up in the home cinema 
Oct 27 2018,positive,one of the best films of 2018 tom cruise and the rest of the ensemble turn great performances the action is the toppest of notches ever existingexisted its clever humorous charming and downright thrilling
Oct 24 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an excellent film it is about ethan hunt and his imf team who race against time after a mission gone wrong tom cruise and henry cavill give amazing performances the screenplay is well written christopher mcquarrie did a great job directing this movie i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure mission impossible  fallout is a must see
Oct 21 2018,positive,this is the best movie in the series as it has well developed characters stellar performances and some of the best action ive seen this year overall this is currently one of my favorite from 2018
Oct 21 2018,positive,great plenty of action 
Oct 21 2018,positive,solid action movie i never remember anything about these films which can be a good and bad thing 
Oct 21 2018,positive,the film continues the absolutely marvellous series of mi in some way it overshadows even magnificent james bond series its really the masterpiece of the action genre this film find the ways to exhilarate again and again  tom cruise as the main hero is excellent as always in his late fifties he jumps fights rides motorbike and helicopter other stuff acts in same spectacular way especially id highlight work of ving rhames and rebekka fergusson characters played by them are round and convincing  the plot is not overcomplicated but extremely gripping this is what good blockbuster should be special effects are staggering and photography is incredible   in conclusion if you big fan of action genre you must see m i fallout if you are not  see it anyway you will defenetly have nice time
Oct 20 2018,positive,extremely entertaining very tense i left the theater exhausted from tensing up so much during the film this is mi at its best cruise and others were fantastic i dont think theres any chance of a new mi topping this one
Oct 20 2018,positive,brilliant film all out action great story cant complain
Oct 20 2018,positive,the best mission impossible ever  one problem the   double agent is discounted for my personal opinion  this film in few spek i have to think
Oct 20 2018,positive,the bathroom sequence explains it all
Oct 20 2018,positive,the probably best action movie i have ever seen tom cruise is about 56 years old and still hanging out of helicopters and riding motorcycles in the  busiest streets in paris the plot of fallout is not too complicated and lacking a lot by falling into plotholes and cliches but with a lot of great decent acting it doesnt becomes a bland movie and knows what it is trying to be
Oct 19 2018,positive,quite possibly one of the best action films ever made did i just say that
Oct 19 2018,positive,fallout will go down as one of the best mission impossible movies to date  henry cavill only adds to the excitement and adventure thats typical of a mi  fallout is packed with brain busting witty and smart action from start to finish
Oct 18 2018,positive,excellent movie love that even though i try to avoid tom cruise movies due to his association with scientology
Oct 17 2018,positive,john woos mission impossible 2 was honestly a masterpiece in the action genre as well as the series mission impossible fallout has crazy action and in my own opinion the best of the series by far
Oct 17 2018,positive,i loved this flickits up there with the best daniel craig bond movie if not better i love bond but mission impossible brngs its own game to the table its bold and brash action packed more bikes more guns more cool gadgets and dirty tricks im gonna buy the whole series on blu ray now tom cruise kicked ass in this great fun
Oct 17 2018,positive,a fresh take on the mission impossible franchise knowing how this film ties in with the first movie we see an action film that also has a story with it knowing this i would strongly recommend everyone goes and sees this film
Oct 17 2018,positive,loved henry cavill i loved his role in the movie and his fight moves
Oct 17 2018,positive,this sixth addition to the mission impossible series is an excellent blockbuster spy flick however i still miss the distinctive impossible mission highlights that cornerstoned the first third and forth films the terrorism ploy is great an all but without much changes this could easily be designated as a new die hard james bond or bourne sequel not to mention that a significant amount of the adrenaline pumping sequences have already been orchestrated in multiple modern blockbuster releases nevertheless it almost impossible not to enjoy a 178 million action movie
Oct 16 2018,positive,same tale new explosions
Oct 15 2018,positive,this is not a bridge too far but a film too far cruise plays methane shunt very well but this excuse for a mission immpossible movie just doesnt cut the mustard in fact as movies go should you choose to take this acting job on tom you shouldnt have and this movie will self destruct in fifteen seconds bang
Oct 15 2018,positive,its really really good its 2h27min runtime packed full of chases and missions with just enough time in between for the audience to catch its breath there are solid performances all around and impressive cinematography both technically and viscerally a return to form in many ways this is almost as good as the 1996 original a few problems with luckiness a few poor lines of dialogue and some overly convoluted backstories are all that kept this from being a 55    originally i gave this movie a 45 but over time all of the issues with it proved to be only nit picks which places it squarely in the 55 category
Oct 15 2018,positive,ive never been the biggest fan of the mission impossible series largely because a film franchise having with the world impossible in the title surly negates the reason for having more than one instalment the few that ive seen i enjoyed a lot less than i was hoping and the last one actively irritated me but this one attracted such acclaim that i couldnt help but be curious about it as a pure action film its one of the finest ive seen this year writerdirector christopher mcquarrie clearly understands that for action to be exciting it must first be comprehensible the chase sequences are beautifully shot and assembled and i could often feel my fists tightening when the heroes were close to danger theyre that tense it does frequently suffer from fast  furious syndrome the term ive devised to describe characters who are so immune from damage and death thats theres never any reason to worry about them and the films plot is a bad combination of old hat and swerveobsessed admittedly some of the twists are pretty funny but the film is constantly trying to make it seem like everyone is a bad guy at some point and it quickly becomes tiresome but aside from that and its assortment of often frustratingly ambiguous spy movie dialogue its a tonne of fun and more than worth watching for the action sequences alone
Oct 14 2018,positive,tom cruise and the gang do it again i loved this movie with all the practical stuntwork and the fun story that had twists and turns as you go 
Oct 14 2018,positive,the movie is gorgeous action is spectacular and the storys believable to a certain extent ethan hunt is no superhuman but skilled and capable for mif plus his the ideal team leader not to mention lucky hes still alive after all the risk he takes is there another mission impossible in the works
Oct 14 2018,positive,one of the finest action movies ever made this is perhaps tom cruises finest work an absolute must see

Oct 11 2018,positive,in the same range as all the other mis tom cruise never disappoints his audiences
Oct 11 2018,positive,the series has gotten so good its a shame tom cruise has to age great action and everything you want from an mi flick
Oct 11 2018,positive,he could be a placenta eater and an overall creepy personandroid but you can deny that of all the movie millionaires tom cruise is perhaps the closest to really deserve his fortune    in an era dominated by repetitive gimmicks the rock and the abuse of the cgi cruise continues to outdo and ratify himself as the absolute purist of cinematic muscular action his fearless stubbornnessdevotion by the explosive aaa blockbuster seemed to respond to an obsessive selfassigned responsibility for raising the torch pathetically abandoned by old legends like stallone gibson or schwarzenegger that is greatly appreciated    fallout has planesequences in halo jumps violent fights choreographies aloikouwais and ambitious pursuits in the league of mad max fury road combined with the sagas recurring tropes as the bomb saved in the last second and the betrayals revealed by multiple unmasks and its a blast    btw fuck superman im glad mustachioed henry cavill stood tall he has a devastating presence and his predictable alliance actually helps build that    in terms of action this is the best one in the series and of all time
Oct 11 2018,positive,a solid 4 star rating many have said its the best in the series i disagree i still say rogue nation is better nevertheless the best movie ive seen this year 
Oct 10 2018,positive,awesome movie full of suspense and action one of the best mission impossible movies and a great movie in general 910 good movie

Oct 7 2018,positive,delivers what it promises completely as written on the tin tom cruise stays true to the character and story making it an action packed adventure enjoyable to watch 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this film is worth watching just for the action alone its by far one of the best action movies in awhile its surprising that the sixth film in a franchise can be in my opinion the best one in the franchise the helicopter chase alone is worth the price of admission 
Oct 7 2018,positive,complete action movie from start to finish this movie deserves a 6th star just for henry cavills mustache
Oct 7 2018,positive,dab dab scrab fallout was shrab
Oct 7 2018,positive,seriously this movie isboring
Oct 7 2018,negative,getting hard to tell one mi movie from the other over the top ending 
Oct 6 2018,positive,what do you do when youve done it all everything apparently 
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie perfection fast paced tom cruise blockbuster that does not disappoint
Oct 6 2018,positive,the first act feels a bit drawn out and heavyhanded but the story offers enough twists and turns and some exhilarating action that i can forgive its flaws besides once the plot takes off fallout is a gripping experience to behold and showcases some of tom cruises most insane stunts
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was always amazed the mi series this one is no exceptions an action packed thriller which i enjoyed from beginning till the end

Oct 1 2018,positive,damn just as good as the last film they almost keep getting better and better
Oct 1 2018,positive,engaging nonstop action but little else
Sep 30 2018,positive,i might be slightly biased because i always have high expectations for the mission impossible franchise but in all honesty im not the movies are just always so nicely executed there is a perfect balance between action comedy and a great plot to create some depth to the entire thing going on in other words each movie always has its purpose a specific climax that prevents the franchise from becoming washed out and i respect it excellent job
Sep 30 2018,positive,loved it definitely the ves mi movie thus far 
Sep 30 2018,positive,a typical mission impossible movie with a thrilling ending
Sep 30 2018,positive,what a blast of a movie a marvel in both storytelling and action and definitely one of the best in an already great franchise
Sep 30 2018,negative,what an incoherent piece of action movie mess its not mission impossible its rather mission not believable one thing is for sure after watching this movie all national security agencies are all gangster like organization protecting their own turf over the dead bodies of others the sad part is that its probably true in real life and probably much worse sickening
Sep 30 2018,positive,its my favorite mission impossible movie   i think the stunts were great the helicopter scene was wow
Sep 30 2018,positive,i was surprised at how much u liked this movie everything clicked 
Sep 29 2018,positive,simply fantastic a true blockbuster with non stop thrilling action from start to finish

Sep 28 2018,positive,packed with action mi fallout takes the franchise to the next level
Sep 28 2018,positive,was mi fallout a good movie sure typical over the top tom cruise action movie i enjoyed it enough i suppose nothing from the movie really stands out for me though oh except for henry cavills robotic acting maybe the crappy acting rubbed off from when he was filming justice league who knows 
Sep 27 2018,positive,beginning to end it was interesting they stepped it up in this one 
Sep 27 2018,negative,such garbage why do these movies get a pass from everyone the plot was nonsense tom cruise has to retrieve nukes that he lost because he left them unguarded obvious twist betrayal ok action scenes absolutely terrible i swore i was done seeing tom cruise movies after tom cruise in space this movie just reinforced my decision 
Sep 27 2018,positive,perfect mission impossible movie
Sep 26 2018,positive,quintessential action adventure movie fast moving catch your breath stunt work a must see in the big screen to feel the size of it all
Sep 26 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is a masterfully made film and it deserves to be regarded as one of the finest action movies ever made fallout is a thrilling well thought out movie by christopher mcquarrie     tom cruise returns as ethan hunt again with a great performance he is not only impressive with the major set pieces fallout presents but he is also plays believable character as far as the characterization of ethan hunt fallout proves to be the best version of him yet ethan has to make tough choices to save what matters to him and it often comes at a cost he has regrets fears and he makes mistakes despite his experience in the field and unique set of skills hunts depth adds much more to this film than any previous entry before it     in a sense this is more a of a spy movie than a typical mission impossible movie instead of the story being built around the set pieces the set pieces fit more organically into the film the antagonist has more of a reason to exist in fallout than just as a big bad to kill his reasoning is flawed but he has complex reasons for doing what he does our villain is a genuinely terrifying and serves as an equal to the godlike skills of someone such ethan hunt     the returning team members are a welcome sight the mission impossible franchise has had a difficult time with continuity aside from cruise  the cast is constantly being shaken up in each movie rebecca ferguson simon pegg ving rhames and michelle monaghan are highlights as returning members of the supporting cast all them play central roles in the plot and to ethans character this movie also goes out of its way to make connections to the rest of the franchise which is a nice shoutout the earlier movies     henry cavill gets to spread his wings with august walker the cia agent forced to work with ethan cavill is powerful in his stature and performance he demonstrates another level to his acting skills that i never saw until fallout he plays walker perfectly     mission impossible fallout is by far the best film in a franchise that continues to improve with each entry between the stellar cast and excellent script this movie serves as an example for what action movies should aspire to be gripping deep and unforgettable
Sep 26 2018,positive,these movies get better and more entertaining each time
Sep 25 2018,positive,tom hanks donets age and his acting never stops being above brilliant im so glad vin rames not sure of the spelling is back  this move deserves all 5stars csislandspa1 on instagram

Sep 23 2018,positive,while not crazy about cruise he rarely makes bad movies and the mi movies are always entertaining this one is no exception 
Sep 23 2018,positive,tom cruise continues to be everimpressive with this franchise this movie delivers in a big way   great story plenty of action and engaging witty characters and conflict if tom keeps this level up on these films it may be the longest running franchise that actually are all great movies
Sep 23 2018,positive,a thrilling new entry in a franchise that proves it is here to stay
Sep 23 2018,positive,an extremely solid film and a definite needtosee for all fans of the series it is certainly one of the best instalments so far with amazing twists scattered throughout the film

Sep 21 2018,positive,lots of fun  fans called this one correct
Sep 21 2018,positive,never a let down with this franchise
Sep 21 2018,positive,pretty standard stuff  high octane action great shots on location and tom cruise sprinting in any of his films dating back to the 80s does he ever not do this  predictable plot twists not much originality and in the desire to pack in as much as possible excessively long at two and a half hours  the improbable dare i say impossible sequence with the fifteen minute countdown seemed to last a half hour at least  i liked how cruise ageless at 56 sometimes gets knocked down or fails in this one and the stunning shots in kashmir  its a summer blockbuster that filmgoers lapped up like ice cream and its entertaining enough as it trots out all the usual tropes  i do wish the mentality was less is more instead of more is better and that there was as much creativity in the story as there was in the stunts  im clearly in the minority though
Sep 21 2018,neutral,no different than every other mi movie 
Sep 21 2018,neutral,usual hollywood makebelieve 
Sep 21 2018,positive,nailbiting fun right from the start

Sep 20 2018,positive,not my favorite in the franchise but its certainly not the worst one looking at you mi 2
Sep 20 2018,positive,a dazzling and exciting installment with dedication to the story and characters
Sep 20 2018,positive,tom cruise is great stunts are great i just left feeling that it needed a bit more depth

Sep 20 2018,positive,completely over the top implausible action thriller loved it
Sep 19 2018,positive,horrible acting but incredibly entertaining
Sep 19 2018,positive,an entertaining entry into the franchise dark and gritty yet still stays on the right side of fun the only issue is you never feel the main cast would bite the dust despite a key death which can be seen coming also the finale is just a run of mill find a bomb and defuse it with a clichéd villain death still thoroughly entertaining  nonetheless
Sep 19 2018,positive,good movie especially henry cavill
Sep 18 2018,positive,best action movie ever highly recommended 
Sep 18 2018,positive,great action packed film  im not the biggest cruise fan but i enjoyed every minute of this somewhat long movie
Sep 18 2018,positive,awesome movie  i was pleasantly surprised in how good it was and i think its the best so far of the mission impossible movies 
Sep 18 2018,positive,its hard to believe that tom cruise and co managed to outdo the burj khalifa but they did    twist turns running fighting driving flying falling more fighting more driving more twists more turns and more damn running    there isnt enough respect given to cruise mcquarrie or abrams for making a bonkers late60s television premise into and even bigger more bonkers film franchise and making it work better than we ever deserved cant wait to see what they come up with next    how can i not recommend a mission impossible film they are the epitome of blockbuster film entertainment at its finest and purest qualities    go see it    edit    it wasnt until my third viewing did i notice that the white widow character played by the very attractive vanessa kirby is the daughter of max the dealer from the first mi film played by the great vanessa redgrave that blew my mind i love how each mi film nods ever so slightly at its predecessors without being so obvious
Sep 18 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout review  if you enjoy action this is the film for you tom cruise has elevated the role of ethan hunt to new heights literally fallout is far from perfect but action scenes with cruise and henry cavill make it worth the price of admission   mission impossible fallout score pay pass or sneakin  film rating  pay 
Sep 18 2018,positive,never having watched a mission impossible film before it was easy to catch up but wish the famous theme tune was in it all in all great film
Sep 18 2018,positive,a great movie really enjoyed myself one of the best in the franchise
Sep 18 2018,positive,one of the best action movies ever the stunts are incredible the action is gripping the story is great the performances are stellar and the music is phenomenal i can go all day about how great fallout is its a fantastic sequel that adds weight and meaning to the rest of the franchise i dont know if we will ever get another movie like this but god help us all if we do

Sep 18 2018,positive,honestly one of my first mi had a nice twist and enough action comedy to keep the storyline tied and entertaining throughout wouldve liked a bit more action but i recommend still   
Sep 18 2018,positive,very good  you will enjoy
Sep 18 2018,positive,i think its safe to say the largesse of the broccoli empire and its finances cant come up with anything close to this absolute rollercoaster breathless would be putting it mildly
Sep 18 2018,positive,a great ride youll feel exhausted from all the action good stuff
Sep 17 2018,negative,after watching this film all i can ask is why
Sep 17 2018,positive,good but not as good as previous mi people sayn best action movie ever i dont think so
Sep 17 2018,positive,really great my initial thought was not another mission impossible but it blew me away definitely go see
Sep 17 2018,positive,good but nothing special another mi 
Sep 17 2018,positive,easily 1 of the best of the mip movies
Sep 17 2018,positive,good but way too looooong its almost 3 hours
Sep 17 2018,positive,worth seeing  but  a little 2 fake  bad guys are terrible shots they missed him like 200 times  they need to go back  to the shooting range
Sep 17 2018,positive,excellent very entertaining movie amazing story and great action i have to give it to tom cruise he does mi movies quite well 
Sep 17 2018,positive,a true action movie spectacular stunts and sequences this movie is the best in its franchise and a must watch for all action movie fans
Sep 17 2018,negative,non stop nonsense and tonnes of fake reviews watch only if you like action movies without any plot
Sep 17 2018,positive,intense all the way till the end
Sep 16 2018,positive,really really liked this movie  edge of my seat the entire time
Sep 16 2018,positive,although these films are a fun ride and they seem to have improved over the last few installments dont expect any surprises it might also be a good idea to see the previous film before this one dont worry cruises 60th birthday is looming on the horizon so not too many more before a reboot 
Sep 16 2018,positive,best mission yet this mission brings together the unpredictable story with the perfect combination of amazing action with both cool new and old tech with characters weve come to know and love in the previous mi movies tom cruz brings a whole other level to the movie by slightly changing the character ethan hunt to a little more professional experienced more relaxed and intelligent than before even adding better stunts and comedy than before also hats off to henry cavils performance whos presence was clever intense and just plain badass 
Sep 16 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an unrelentingly consistent action movie
Sep 16 2018,positive,best movie of the entire serirs
Sep 16 2018,neutral,action 9 story2 acting3 dialogue 1
Sep 16 2018,positive,preview like cool and perfect girls are in i thing 
Sep 16 2018,positive,so many plot twists that it makes it exciting not just a boring action movie
Sep 16 2018,positive,adrenaline rush from the very start to the very end 
Sep 16 2018,negative,first kudos to cruise for giving his all in every movie he deserves a lot of credit    however having said that this was so hilariously ridiculous    the writing was so bad everything had to be explained every 15 minutes through lengthy expositions there is nothing worse than a writer that has to explain through dialogue things that could otherwise be shown or told in a way where you dont feel like its a powerpoint presentation of what is about to happen or what could go wrong    not gonna tell you what happens but the last part was just so insanely bad 15 minutes haha in 15 minutes cruise stole a helicopter fell from it in midair hanging from it climbed back up disarmed two soldiers took over the helicopter chased the other dude through mountains getting shot at for what seemed like forever then crashed the mountains meanwhile the other crew spent time looking for the bomb got captured tied up got loose fought the bad guy for what seemed like 20 minutes we have to pretend a woman was able to beat the hell out of a trained soldiers     after all of that there was still 5 minutes left on the clock haha    come on you have to be really unsophisticated to accept that and throw your suspension of disbelief away
Sep 16 2018,positive,hands down one of the best action films made in years amazing film
Sep 16 2018,neutral,my least favorite the main bad guy made super complex villainy decisions that didnt ring true
Sep 15 2018,positive,excellent movie action packed tom cruise at his best
Sep 15 2018,positive,great action and drama the best film in the series
Sep 15 2018,positive,its a good one despite i found more entertainy the 3rd4th and 5th films
Sep 15 2018,positive,there was two scenes in this movie i thoroughly enjoyed and even though it was a fun movie to watch it was all too simple and predictable there needs to be some sort of true punishment for ethan you cant have six mission impossible movies where none of them have failed rogue nation was much better in my opinion
Sep 15 2018,positive,tom cruise continuous to deliver for this franchise  action non stop with good acting
Sep 15 2018,positive,as entertaining and fun as youd expect from a mission impossible movie no more no less
Sep 15 2018,positive,very good fun but weve seen this story a bazillion times  not original
Sep 15 2018,positive,just as good as rogue nation in my honest opinion like other mi movies its action packed and filled with surprises i love jessica ferguson though she good ethan hunt is truly the same ol ethan in this one and that aint bad
Sep 15 2018,positive,very good action flick
Sep 15 2018,positive,this is by far the greatest mi movie yet a month before i watched this i saw the 35 or so minute behind the scenes trailer where they show tom cruise doing all of the stunts which is absolutely insane the fact that almost all of the crazy chases and hijinx are real made this movie 1000x better this is by far the best action movie ive seen in a while
Sep 15 2018,positive,tom cruise looked tired in this movie but he still brings it  yes i know he was meant to look tired in parts but i still enjoy this crazy persons movies
Sep 15 2018,positive,its mission impossible and its literally impossible not to please the viewer the action scenes while predictable are also amazing to watch the cinematography and production design is top notched tom cruise and henry cavill are at their best as these characters negatives for me is the writing is very predictable and lacked newness about midway it really slows down for about 20 minutes or so only the box office will tell if another mi will be in the works but if this is the last then they ended on a high note also i liked rogue nation better
Sep 15 2018,negative,if you want to watch this movies to know what happens just watch all of the rest of mi movies they are all the same plot
Sep 14 2018,positive,enjoyed it but a lot of the intended humorous dialogue between the characters fell flat  the mission plot twists and action doesnt quite live up to previous installments for this franchise
Sep 14 2018,positive,i thought it was really well done i kind of felt like in ghost protocol that he would just fail over and over again but in this one it was like he would win some and then loose some story line was good too 
Sep 14 2018,positive,as a huge mission impossible groupie i own copies of all of them however i feel that with each sequel the storyline has become increasingly complicated and hard to follow dont get me wrong it still had its multiple chase scenes fantastical fight scenes good special effects and most of the original cast tom cruise simon pegg ving rhames rebecca ferguson  michelle monaghan  alec baldwin but they have almost too many characters in their storyline lots of bad guys hard to keep track of all of them and so many twists and turns that it makes following the plot quite challenging i know when im constantly looking at my phone to see the time a movie is dragging on and has too many longdrawn out conversations i was always hoping that ethan  julia would find a way back to each other but not in the way that it happened in this movie im sure ill watch it again once its streaming just to figure out what i missed the first time around
Sep 14 2018,positive,what a scene from begining to end this is why i love action movies
Sep 14 2018,positive,in this too much explored genre it is hard to make something that the spectator never saw before and surprise him fallout does that bringing a twisted plot to the spectator however the last scene that has a 15 minutes countdown disappoints bringing incredibility to this story come on how does all of that happen in just 15 minutes this is the real impossible mission however it is fun to watch and i have to say that i loved the first scene when the thief believes he is talking live on the news and the walls fell and it was just scenario
Sep 14 2018,positive,action was terrific the story was gripping only problem is the movie was about 45 minutes too long
Sep 14 2018,positive,just make this movie franchise into a tv show already same old mission impossible same old enjoyable movie 
Sep 14 2018,positive,while this is certainly a decent action film and one of the more coherent in the mission impossible franchise i do not get how it reached 97 on the tomatometer tom cruise at his usual meh
Sep 14 2018,positive,not many franchises get better and better with time but mi keeps on delivering great action sequences and satisfying character moments
Sep 14 2018,neutral,maybe i am just getting tired of the mission impossible films bad guy gets powerful weapon that tom and his associates have to recover this one varied in that there were so many people chasing tom and his friends that you needed a scorecard to keep track even at the end i wasnt sure whether the director of the cia was a good person or another villain and toms relationship with his former wife is i suppose designed to promote sympathy for a love that cannot be      all iin all i was glad when the movie was over the action scenes were as good as you hear but how many times can you watch poor tom jump out of a building fall three stories shake it off and then start running like a marathon runner trying to catch the bad guy who always seems to have a helicopter waiting       in sum this movie will be a pleasant diversion for you but dont stand in line to see it
Sep 13 2018,positive,the greatest action movie in my life
Sep 13 2018,positive,as far as enjoyment goes this movie is a 55 when i saw the first trailer i thought to myself this looks so good omg i need to see this when the movie came out i was busy working but my friend told me that it was a great film now i didnt really like rogue nation too much and the only mi movie i saw besides that was mi 3 which i was a fantastically done masterpiece i wasnt expecting it to be great but to just be a fun action experience what i got was a fantastic story masterfully done stunts beautiful set pieces and a twist i kinda knew was going to happen but still shocked me  i totally recommend this film to anyone who like fun action stunts and storylines that are coherent
Sep 13 2018,neutral,just another minothing new
Sep 13 2018,positive,good movie not bad tom cruise
Sep 13 2018,positive,the stunts are ridiculous you need a program to keep track of the plot
Sep 13 2018,neutral,if you love tons of chasing through the streets roof tops and alleys then you will love this moving  to me it seems to be copying what everyone else is doing limited story but lots of action
Sep 13 2018,positive,going to watch this movie i had high hopes but also a tiny part of me thought could a sixth instalment in a franchise be good my answer is yes and not only that but its the best in the series and one of the best action movies of all time i was constantly at the edge of my seat i got the jokes and the action sequenses were amazing the thing with this movie and all the movies in the series is that when you see tom cruise hanging under a helicopter he is actually doing it so the adrenaline is at its highest the car chases and movements were very realistic the casting was perfect and the storyline fantastic the 3rd act could be the best 3rd act i have seen in a movie for a very long time i have nothing bad to say about this movie 55 stars
Sep 12 2018,negative,need a new better actor in the lead
Sep 12 2018,positive,ive always had kind of a lovehate relationship with the mission impossible series to be honest  on one hand the original mission impossible was easily one of the best blockbusters of the 90s and it was an interesting slowburn thriller in addition to having memorable set pieces  and they were memorable  name one quote or location from the sequels that stood out without looking it up  brian de palma knew his craft  and one must admire the practical effects the series has become known for  tom cruise does seem to court death when making these insisting to do almost every stunt himself  but i honestly do not particularly care for the sequels  an issue it seems on which i am probably alone  many have noted how the sequels are outlandish fun and embrace the inherent wackiness of the spy genre  at the same time bond got more serious and in touch with his ian fleming roots mission impossible went nuts and audiences rewarded the franchise for it  impossible seems to have a similar trajectory and fanbase to the fast and the furious series with each movie getting progressively more overthetop  both are selfaware of how ridiculous the whole thing has gotten  but thats okay  you are in on the joke      the most recent iteration mission impossible fallout surprisingly has no power armor vaulttec super mutants or pipboys  bad joke  sorry  no you already know the gist of these movies  the plot is essentially meaningless  blah blah blah infiltrate bad guys  blah blah blah doublecross  blah blah blah nukes  blah blah blah weve got to get the detonator before everyone dies  you are here for the set pieces and to watch the space pope run from explosions and hang out of planes and helicopters in peril  this movie is a direct sequel to fallout rogue nation so it may have helped to have seen that movie and remembered something about it  good luck with that  that being said the series does have some great recurring characters at this point such as ving rhames simon pegg and rebecca ferguson whose supporting performances do add quite a bit of humor and occasional drama  there is a bit of a return to old world spy craft and a retreat from the scifi tech of the previous two movies which is a welcome change  tom cruise commits totally as mentioned before and he is allowed several good scenes with different actors including an enthusiastic henry cavill  many have called this the best action movie of the year  to me this wouldnt sound accurate even if there wasnt plenty of 2018 to go  but it may be the best rental movie of 2018  so yes while it may not be my cup of tea mission impossible fallout would make a perfectly adequate rental or streaming option should you choose to accept it
Sep 12 2018,positive,best action and story movie of the year 
Sep 12 2018,positive,good action a little too long and a little too many lucky breaks that starts to seem too unrealistic to relate 
Sep 12 2018,positive,action yes car chase yes super strong punches yes cliffhangers yes bombs yes impossible missions definitely yes 
Sep 12 2018,positive,this one was so crazy it was believable
Sep 11 2018,positive,this is the best mi in the whole movie franchise
Sep 11 2018,negative,terrible boring movie cruise has lost his touch and he needs to just stick to scientology and miscavitch  what a waste of a good story line
Sep 11 2018,positive,whether you have seen any of these movies or not this movie will have you entertained on all levels
Sep 11 2018,positive,good old action movie never kills someone  
Sep 11 2018,positive,a masterpiece of its kind
Sep 11 2018,negative,the movie is a yawner
Sep 11 2018,positive,really good movie  didnt look at my watch once  action packed interesting with edge of seat moments and various twists and turns
Sep 11 2018,positive,a fun filled action ride
Sep 10 2018,negative,well tom i cant take you seriously after i learned your teeth are not aligned with your face but i love helicopters so theres that
Sep 10 2018,positive,predictable but good
Sep 10 2018,positive,a five star rating excellent cast great director everything is great about it in short a must see
Sep 10 2018,positive,i loved this movie and so did my husbandi have seen it four times and i am still not over it he has seen it three times and every time we suggest it to a friend they cannot get over it either 
Sep 10 2018,positive,one of the best films of the entire summer cant wait to see what they do with the next mission impossible film
Sep 10 2018,positive,ive seen better mission impossibles
Sep 10 2018,positive,i had amc stubs for ticket tuesdays and now amc alist and i regret not getting it sooner because i should have seen this again in imax it runs a bit long at about 25 hours but that is a guarantee that you will get your moneys worth and god knows how much money they put into this film highly recommend
Sep 9 2018,positive,the mission impossible movies have gotten better with each movie except with mission impossible 2 from the third movie and onward these movies have  become pure popcorn action thrillers and it works this movie builds on what happened in rogue nation making it a more personal story with ethan hunt tom cruise is great as this character and because he does his own stunts and they are insane it makes this franchise better for it henry cavill is great in this movie being this tough brawler cia agent this movie takes everything you would want from a mission impossible movie it has great action an interesting story cool twists and turns that i did not see coming except for one of them and it also has comedy mission impossible fallout is my personal favorite movie in this franchise which is a personal preference thing i think this is the best action movie of the summer
Sep 9 2018,positive,its wonderful tom the better of the world
Sep 9 2018,positive,it blows my mind that were six films into this franchise and it only gets better and better with each movie
Sep 9 2018,positive,visually stunning and down right fun
Sep 9 2018,positive,apparently the best action movie in recent times and the best among the franchise
Sep 9 2018,positive,tomcruise is literally a great actor respect him
Sep 8 2018,positive,i liked this movie sometimes the script seemed a bit forced but i enjoyed it 
Sep 8 2018,positive,this is my favorite mi movie and i have liked them all i think it is the best action movie for the last several years
Sep 8 2018,positive,this might be my favorite mi movie the plot and action is nonstop and i love tom cruise 
Sep 8 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is a thoroughly enjoyable film the action set pieces were intense and unique all the stunts had the audience around us flinching and gasping with all the drawn out set pieces came a lot of tension and unforeseen twists this time around ethan hunt is finally given more emotional depth that contributes to the higher stakes and tension and the characters arent simply expendable the pace is relentless and there are few if any quiet slow moments if you need a fast paced movie with less exposition to keep you watching id definitely recommend this one i had a lot of fun watching fallout with a reactive audience so if you get the chance see this fun action film in a theater
Sep 8 2018,positive,good action stay awake follow the plot 
Sep 8 2018,negative,this movie is unbelievably predictable and bland the bmw product placement is exceptionally annoying would not watch again
Sep 8 2018,positive,the best installment of mission impossible tom cruise follows the footsteps of oldschool jackie chan movies by doing his own stunts
Sep 8 2018,negative,just a bad spoof on a blockbuster series i was pumped about seeing this film then superbly disappointed
Sep 8 2018,positive,the action sequences where good not sure about the plot
Sep 8 2018,positive,not bad but i wouldnt call it the best yet it was much too long with all those over the top action scenes the comedy was good with the tongue in cheek exaggeration of the save the world plot excellent characters and acting from all despite tom cruise and angela bassetts disturbingly botoxed faces would not watch again but roughly worth the first sitting especially with standout newcomer vanessa kirby
Sep 8 2018,positive,best action flick of 2018  tom cruise is cray cray
Sep 8 2018,positive,awesome in 3d my favorite mission impossible movie to date
Sep 8 2018,positive,very good except excellent movie
Sep 8 2018,positive,liked rogue nation better this one was little more inclined towards turning the series into a franchising fleshing out ethans character more than all previous installments combined so a little bit cliched in places but a great movie
Sep 7 2018,positive,action packed loved every second
Sep 7 2018,positive,as close to perfect as an action movie can get
Sep 7 2018,positive,one of the best in the series perfect balance of story and action 
Sep 7 2018,positive,really good addition to the franchise enjoyed watching it even though most of the plot was easy to guess
Sep 7 2018,positive,the mission impossible movies have sure taken a weird trajectory  it kind of reminds me of the trajectory of fast  furious movies the first one is fine the second one is terrible the third one i skipped and after that they finally started to find their groove  in terms of story it is mostly your standard spy thriller stuff which honestly im not always the biggest fan of  i like spy movies fine i especially like watching the spies work and use all their gadgets and just do their job but when it comes to their convoluted plots its a little hard for me to get invested  again this was a drawback for me in fallout  the core of the story works fine but some of the little detours to get their felt unnecessary and there was a twist that i saw coming since the first trailer  also without going too deep into spoilers how many times is mission impossible going to deal with a double crossing agent  these issues aside the story still works for the most part because the characters work  the villains motivations do seem straight up psychotic but when you hears his explanation you do kind of see where hes coming from  i mean its still psychotic and you know he needs to be stopped but you understand how he got to that point  it addresses the toll of ethan hunts career on his personal life which almost seems meta to tom cruise now that i think about it and while i miss jeremy renner its nice to see ving rhames and simon pegg returning and their team chemistry is just as good as ever  enough about all that though hows the action  its mission impossible its great  these movies have become known for having some of the best action ever for use of practical effects no stunt doubles and the very real possibility tom cruise might die  there were a few scenes where i found myself looking for the wires or looking for the edges for the green screen or cgi and i couldnt find it so either it was all real or they did a damn good job of making it look real  in either case kudos  its also the type of action that is godamn relentless almost to the point of parody  it pushes things right up to the edge literally if theres a scene by a cliff where something has a chance of falling you bet your ass it will tumble right to the godamn corner of that that cliffside  the movie pushes you and pushes and pushes and then pulls back just a little bit only to push one final time  its godamn artistry in tension  its that perfect sort of tension where hey we know this type of movie we have a pretty good idea that the good guys are going to win but were still tense every step of the way  theres scenes where im thinking i know tom cruise cant die because hes in more way scenes in the trailer were only halfway through the movie and hes godamn tom cruise so why am i so worried about him right now  its an impressive level of tension that reminded me of spielberg at his best moments  mind you its not quite up to that same level but that im even considering that comparison is godamn impressive  bottom line mission impossible fallout is just a near perfect spy movie  my biggest complaints come from the fact that its a bit too long and while i enjoyed it all it did start to wear on me and the fact that spy stories just dont always draw me in personally  if spy stories are your thing though theres not much better  i still loved the movie mind you its about as good a spy movie as i could ever hope to see  i love the team i love seeing these people work and its some of the best practical action ive ever seen

Sep 7 2018,positive,fallout know how to engage the audience with lots of intense and breathtaking actions cruise and cavill is impressive totally superb and bombastic totally surpassed the expectations
Sep 7 2018,positive,i think this got pretty over hyped for me after all the critical praise i was expecting the best action movie of the year and i definitely didnt get that the action is really great its pulse pounding and well choreographed but the plot is just so generic and predictable every time someones face is revealed it feels like it was telegraphed a mile away and the story is about them trying to stop an exspy with a personal vendetta who is going to set off some nukes im pretty sure there are like five james bond movies with that exact plot     i think a big part of the hype was the whole thing about tom cruise actually flying the helicopter but it didnt really add anything the way they captured the action with stationary cameras actually made it feel less real to me like if they had shot it on a green screen it wouldnt have made a difference they never got one great shot that made it all worth it it reminds me of boyhood a mediocre film praised for its production rather than its actual content not that fallout is as bad as boyhood it is good far too long but good i loved the washroom fight simon pegg is always a joy to watch it had a really good balance of humour and action and im probably being way to harsh on it  just wish it had a smarter screenplay
Sep 7 2018,negative,really this move makes sense to anyone how is ethan hunt a super human now defying the laws of physics while riding a motorcycle  or hang a helicopter on a rope with hook that latches on a piece of rock   i shouldve known that if jj abrams is involved it will be a nonsensical bullshit on screen undemanding halwits might have fun watching it not recommended if u pay attention   positive reviews from top critics must have been purchased i dont believe those could be honest reviews
Sep 7 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is outrageous fun slick cinematography  an exceedingly smart screenplay surpasses even the high bar set by rogue nation mi firmly cemented as the action franchise all others are to be measured against
Sep 7 2018,positive,one of the top action movies ever made
Sep 7 2018,positive,tom botox is back  147 minutes really  ive lost interest at 100  why so long why  besides no surprises imf is about the hidden plan that surprise you at the end   not here
Sep 7 2018,neutral,started off strong and fell apart in the last 30 minutes that should have been 15 minutes
Sep 7 2018,positive,i have liked all of the mission impossible films and this one is the third best in my opinion still extremely entertaining and tom cruise holds together an always enjoyable class of misfits in a solid action film with neat tricks and gadgets too delight he also kept his shirt on which was a plus for me because tom never has been known for his beefy biceps and yet something compels him to do so in every movie the cast of supporting characters were my favorite in this film the only part that fell short for me was that it just wasnt as dynamic as some of his predecessors this film is a great franchise and the film needs to be seen at the movies
Sep 7 2018,positive,didnt see the others but its enjoyable if you like action you probably already seen the others so theres no point recommending it to action movie fans since mission impossible is the quintessential action movie
Sep 7 2018,positive,brilliant the best mi yet  tom cruise is amazing
Sep 7 2018,positive,im a mission impossible junky enjoy the continuing action 
Sep 7 2018,positive,let me start by saying mission impossiblefallout was an impeccable movie down to production and story line a very well made film the camera angles alone were enough to have me on the edge of my seat so many unexpected plot twist that you just dont see comingthis action packed movie was just enough to have me twisting in my seat and shielding my eyes     the lesson i picked up on was something i instill in my students my nieces and nephews and myself you can achieve the impossible as long as you believe in yourself having the confidence in your ability determines how you feel about being abe to accomplish something even the impossible     my reason for this throughout the movie ethan is faced with making the impossible happen even when his team and superiors ask how he finds a way      i havent seen the rest of the mission impossible franchise but if they are anything like this one i might have to check them out i throughly enjoyed watching this movie and will recommend it 
Sep 7 2018,negative,wish i could give it a zero rating every scene was so over the top and so predictable
Sep 6 2018,positive,i saw all the great reviews and was reluctant but i went and the movie was i hate to say it typical mission impossible if you like the mission impossible movies before youll enjoy this one i thought it was ok just ok
Sep 6 2018,positive,great action packed film that will leave a peppermint mark and go down as one of the greatest mission impossible and spy movies of the 21st century  92
Sep 6 2018,positive,id give it 5 stars if i didnt dislike t cruise and what his beliefs are so much hes not an excellent actor but his action movies are very entertaining i just dont want to support scientology at all 
Sep 6 2018,positive,mi is an amazing movie it has great action twists and  atmosphere if you have not watched it you are missing on a exeleratin movie
Sep 6 2018,positive,just like all the other action movies no unexpected events you will see it coming but a fun watch regardless
Sep 6 2018,positive,a film that is one of the better mission impossible only not as good as 3 for the villain great action and performances with a tight script if you want to watch it avoid the trailers as they give away too much
Sep 6 2018,positive,this movie is 1 summer movie in a world
Sep 6 2018,positive,it was the typical tom cruise action movie we have come to expect and delivered
Sep 6 2018,positive,soooo action packed just awesome 
Sep 6 2018,positive,611  movie was pleasant to watch without too much painful to watch scene i do expect a bit more action or even gadget storyline was ok its im so no point going hard on the helicopter scene 
Sep 5 2018,positive,tom cruise is the best 
Sep 5 2018,positive,thanks to amazing stunts and realistic fun action mission impossible fallout is the best movie in the franchise so far despite its more or less story
Sep 5 2018,positive,enjoyable and ridiculous as allways
Sep 5 2018,positive,one of the best installments in what is one of the best action franchises of our generation    video review 
Sep 5 2018,negative,the more i think about this movie the less i like it   90 of the movie is the obvious double agent is a double agent and the good guys always win there arent any surprises or anything new i dont understand why its so well rated its a very okay movie
Sep 5 2018,positive,maybe im jaded but i neeed some fresh blood in this franchise  it was extremely well done but im done getting excited about  old men being unbeatable
Sep 5 2018,positive,some movie honestly its a beautiful action movie and it keeps you on the edge of youre seat the whole time and its a major shoutout to henry cavill
Sep 5 2018,positive,great stunts but mediocre and repetitive storyline too many narrow escapes
Sep 4 2018,positive,the most actionpacked of the series the only bad thing i can say about it is that it was hard to tell the difference between ethans two love interests 
Sep 4 2018,positive,i like the actionpacked film  once again the movie delivers stunts and explosions and car chases  i couldnt ask for more i recommend it 
Sep 4 2018,positive,the plot is intriguing keeps you alert all way throughout the movie
Sep 4 2018,positive,fallout is the sixth and best entry in the franchise and is likely to go down as one of the greatest action movies ever made it raises the bar for every action film that is to come   tom cruise returns as ethan hunt once again and in this film he is absolutely incredible running jumping climbing diving this is greatest stunt performance ever by an actor it took him years to learn to do the halo jump for this film and in doing so is the first actor ever to record on camera it is absolutely breathting not even a broken ankle stops cruise at the age of 56 it is unreal  director christopher mcquarie returns for his second mission impossible film after 2015s rogue nation and fallout is easily better not to take anything away from rogue nation fallout is mcquaries best film to date and is leaving me curious if another mission impossible film will grace the screen and if mcquarie and cruise will return if there is  the script is simply downright badass and awesome cruise and company deliver every line with power and confidence written solo  by mcqaurie the script also holds many details and callbacks to the previous films which are interesting and cool to  see henry cavill and sean harris are ideal villains as members of the syndicate they both seem fearless determined and incredibly difficult to stop   in the end fallout takes your breath away time and time again giving you faith in all summer blockbusters it was totally worth the wait your mission should you choose to accept is to read this review and see mission impossiblefallout now
Sep 4 2018,positive,another good mission impossible movie the twist was not surprising at all though i thought ghost protocol was much better but this one was one of the better ones
Sep 4 2018,negative,this was the worst mission impossible since the second one as best as i can recall the script is flat the story weak and the plot predictable and jumbled to fit everyones cameo or highlight in     the finale is so bad it deserves its own callout it was so flimsy several in the crowd laughed when it wasnt meant to be funny because it defied logic and gravity to a comedic extent     overall the film is so cliched and vanilla that multiple times i compared it to michael scotts threat level midnight from the office unfavorably
Sep 4 2018,positive,rogue nation was my favorite in this series until now fallout was very well done mi has done a great job of holding a really solid cast together i did miss jeremy ritter
Sep 4 2018,positive,action packed  loved it
Sep 4 2018,positive,thrilling and fascinating movie after all its a good movie even for noob fan of mission impossible th storyline action and plot twist so good so we can really enjoy the film
Sep 4 2018,negative,you are ready for cruze to die in this movie next one he will be a geriatric

Sep 3 2018,positive,lots of action and the chase scenes are incredible
Sep 3 2018,positive,a very fun not stop thrill
Sep 3 2018,positive,fun your typical mi movie great stunts and good fun
Sep 3 2018,positive,the film delivers great action pieces as well as great disappointment given the rave reviews the plots always come out of the same mould but this entry seemed to be weaker in this regard all we seem to get here are repeated action scenes with little of anything in between creating too much repetition and a little boredom i had just watched the last one and i think that was elevated by a tighter plot an actual impossible mission in it and the initial mystery surrounding rebecca fergusons character though i was glad to see her back as shes a great character not bad but not amazing either
Sep 3 2018,positive,best movie ever the helicopter scene was awesome
Sep 3 2018,negative,way too long and totally unrealistic to the point of absurdity did not  enjoy
Sep 3 2018,positive,tom cruise once again does what we expect him to do and he is brilliant also lots of twists and turns in this film it left me satisfied i have to mention the scenes in france were nice locations and the chases loved it
Sep 3 2018,negative,how in gods name is this 97 this is 3 hours of tom cruise fellating himself  the story makes no sense none of the characters are interesting and the acting makes you want to claw your eyes out
Sep 3 2018,positive,great movie loved watching it 
Sep 3 2018,positive,i saw this movie in 3d and absolutely loved it
Sep 3 2018,positive,one of the best movies in a long time and love that its a fun escape without any political statements ruining it
Sep 3 2018,positive,predictable at times but another good mi movie
Sep 3 2018,neutral,same old movie basically just one chaserun after another not much plot but enjoyable enough 
Sep 3 2018,positive,insane film they keep getting better and better 
Sep 2 2018,positive,great popcorn movie entertaining but forgettable
Sep 2 2018,positive,perfect amount of action and the stunts performed by tom cruise really makes the movie and all the scenes extra realistic i really enjoyed the ride 
Sep 2 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is a franchise saviour hang on to your seats it is actionpacked thrilling entertaining movie of the summer the movie has many decoys and sub plots and suspense you will be not be disappointed mission accomplished by ethan hunt and the imf
Sep 2 2018,neutral,predictable and too jokey for me and ving rhames got way too much screen time wouldve been more interesting if nukes had gone off in a couple of cities it wouldve shown us some actual fallout from a mission like that failing 
Sep 2 2018,positive,entertaining over the top action superman was actually good the bathroom fight scene was awesome
Sep 2 2018,negative,if you have a male tween or teen they will love it otherwise change your expectations enjoy the scenery and think of it as a comedy the acting was bad perhaps because of the script  predictable and long
Sep 2 2018,positive,although we are not big tom cruise fans we absolutely loved this latest in the series nonstop action believability and a good story kept us on the edge of our seats well done
Sep 2 2018,positive,action at its finest made for 4dx cinemas
Sep 2 2018,positive,the cast and story is terrific and like all mission impossible movies very exciting a must see movie
Sep 2 2018,positive,the mission impossible series never disappointed ushenry cavil did a great  job portraying august walker this movie really did a great job displaying the cold scenario that couldve have been real
Sep 1 2018,positive,my heart pounding and sometimes i forgot it was a movie perfect
Sep 1 2018,positive,outstanding movie cruise and the mi cast were great
Sep 1 2018,positive,with all the schlock that deluges the american cinema these days under the banner of action movie its encouraging to see a film that clearly worked hard to entertain you while presenting itself as just flatout fun also tom cruise is a superhuman
Sep 1 2018,positive,i didnt know it was possible to be titillated for 25hrs straight until i saw mission impossible  fallout i havent been to see an action movie since fate of the furious in 2017 but fallout had higher stakes better action juicier plot points and the exhilaration of knowing tom cruise does his own stunts it harkens back to the first mission impossible that thrilled me 20 years ago in all the best ways true to form you get to see the identity bending intrigue without it ever becoming campy they could make 10 more just like this one and i would go see them all
Sep 1 2018,neutral,the only reason i rated 510 the highest i could possibly give  is that its a mission impossible movie almost fell asleep for the first half no kidding
Sep 1 2018,positive,the best mission impossible yet by far this movie has non stop action but sill has a great story the last 30 minutes is amazing one of my favourite movies
Sep 1 2018,positive,this is an amazing action movie i am really happy that i went to see it in theaters
Sep 1 2018,negative,how do people sit ad warch this boring nonsensical garbage
Sep 1 2018,positive,the best movie of the franchise 
Sep 1 2018,positive,fantastic action and suspense movie the stunts werent so crazy either that you were left laughing like furious 8 for example
Sep 1 2018,positive,the only question in such a movie isdoes it keep the charm of the old tv seriesbecause you know it has everything elsebig stargreat supporterslots and i mean lots of actioni found it to try with the best of intentions butsomethings missingyou dont really focus on the missing part with everything thas going onbut i want that thing in orde r to be really thrilled and to watch it again some timefor me it did not have that thingbut everything else is certainly in its placeyou gey your moneys worth tom always makes sure of thathe is a great a proyou can argue about other things concerning his life but not his commitment in the movie bussinessand his audience
Aug 31 2018,positive,fun movie great action tom cruise earns his money cavill fun love rebecca ferguson
Aug 31 2018,positive,fast paced and full of action right out of the gate the stunts make up for some of the lacking story line 
Aug 31 2018,positive,a nonstop action packed thriller which doesnt skip out on telling a interesting story and in typical mi fashion includes tons of twists and turns
Aug 31 2018,positive,cant ask for much more excitementenjoyed the ride
Aug 31 2018,positive,this seems to be a serious move eat the beginning but left us howling laughing at the end the details of the espionage was confusing  but the action scenes alone made the whole thing worth seeing
Aug 31 2018,positive,great movie if you like action this is it chief
Aug 31 2018,positive,loved this action packed
Aug 31 2018,positive,a perfect action movie in every aspect drags you to the edge of your seat from the start and leaves you there right till the end credits it is everything you could possibly want and more
Aug 31 2018,positive,phenomenal action film cast music story script cinematography effects and stunts are all outstanding seamlessly links all previous mi films together if this film doesnt prompt a new oscar category for stunts nothing ever will
Aug 31 2018,positive,spectacular action sequences propel a complex yet entertaining story fueled by the charimatic tom cruise
Aug 31 2018,positive,best one of the series
Aug 31 2018,positive,solid movie worth seeing not my all time favorite of the series but definitely in the top 3 
Aug 30 2018,positive,easily one of the best mi films if not the best
Aug 30 2018,negative,i would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if i hadnt been sitting there the whole time mad at tom cruz for not being in his daughter suris life enough because of his loony toons scifi religion
Aug 30 2018,positive,great movie actionpacked and relates to the fifth one great work as well by all the cast 
Aug 30 2018,positive,very good movie was not perfect though i feel that this movie was too predictable and you knew that in the end they were going to complete the impossible mission    i would recommend this movie to someone that likes the series but for someone who hasnt seen the previous movies it may be confusing since many characters from the previous movies return it is not really important to understand this movie but they do refer to previous movies in some moments
Aug 30 2018,positive,i thought the movie was great my only issue was that it could of been 2030 minutes shorter a few scenes seemed to drag just a bit too long but overallstill great would highly recommend 
Aug 30 2018,positive,great action theater worthy good ride they attempted to make it a high concept film by adding multiple story lines  twists way over shot the mark result too long and convoluted stories good action ignore story
Aug 30 2018,positive,this movie suffered from a severe lack of editing and lack of the team camaraderie that existed in the series and previous movies  the long chase scenes get extremely tedious when they happen over and over and the last 15 mins of the movie went on too long  i really think this franchise is ready to be put to bed
Aug 30 2018,positive,best mission impossible movie yet loved every second of this movie everything from the story to the stunts is just so well done i highly recomend this movie for everybody
Aug 30 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an almost perfect action film it has incredible action well good cinematography and editing and interesting characters it is the best mi film and the of the best action movies of all time
Aug 30 2018,neutral,nope its not the best movie in the series it rises up from the thud of the previous chapter in which cruise had fallen into the selfparody and simon pegg was his comical sidekick it returns to the serious and committed spy movie but there are too many plot twists and above all is devoid of those ingenious unforgettable sequences that mark the first episode directed by de palma in 1996  mauro lanari
Aug 30 2018,positive,i still continue to be impressed about how the mi movies have managed to get better and better with each passing movie cant be many or any  franchises like that toy story is the only one that comes to mind 
Aug 30 2018,positive,the entire movie seems very real and the stakes and conflict are very well set up though the plot twist seemed a little predictable it was an interesting movie that constantly made me sit at the edge of the seat
Aug 29 2018,negative,far far too long for what ended up being a generic action movie with a very soft plot gained one star from the minimum only due to a couple of good performances from the supporting case tom cruise as usual ok at best
Aug 29 2018,neutral,its the same old thing the formula has gotten boring 
Aug 29 2018,positive,if youve seen all the mip movies nothing will surprise you but its fun 
Aug 29 2018,positive,one of the best action movies of the last decade tom cruise is at the top of his game  action scenes are a true work of art from its wild choreography to its breathtaking  cinematography   the movie is very well paced with an averageish plot and a somewhat predictable plot twist   all in all this is the best one of the series   absolutely rewatchable
Aug 29 2018,positive,great action cruise delivers with the best mi yet go see it in imax 
Aug 29 2018,positive,really good and ties in the older movies in some great and creative ways  lots of great action and some nice twists and turns
Aug 29 2018,positive,i loved this movie before seeing this film ghost protocol was my favorite entry in the mission impossible series now fallout is my new favorite the action scenes are phenomenally shot and choreographed it leaves you on the edge of your seat the entire time and overall its an extremely entertaining experience i highly recommend if you havent already seen it
Aug 29 2018,positive,great movie  u cannot blink 
Aug 29 2018,positive,ethan hunt never disappoints this movie is freaking awesome action packed without being super fake like taken or something like that great cast great story just totally worth every minute and every penny just a all around great time
Aug 29 2018,positive,tom cruise did his best one of the best action movies
Aug 29 2018,positive,outstanding in every respect
Aug 29 2018,positive,an eminently watchable film that rackets up to one of the most enthralling final acts in recent memory
Aug 28 2018,positive,what else can i say but amazing action packed goodness 
Aug 28 2018,positive,once again tom cruise delivers a thrilling movie that is very watchable sure you can pick apart pieces of it and say it is not possible or that it is extremely unrealistic but that is not what entertainment is about entertainment is about the reaction to the work and this movie is very entertaining beyond its entertaining storyline it is very well shot has very good dialogue that doesnt make you fall asleep in between action sequences but is rather the surprise side that comes with your meal sure you didnt order it but your glad its there
Aug 28 2018,positive,best movie of the summer
Aug 28 2018,positive,another great addition to the franchise
Aug 28 2018,neutral,great scenery and acting the locations that were used were amazing  downtown france england and pulpit rock in norway the issue was the writing was played out and typical for an action flick  as usual everyone else is shot but no main characters ever get hit by a bullet  you can predict what is going to happen next no interesting plot twists  they conveniently forget plutonium while having a bro scene together while the bad guys steal it  this movie was entertaining from a mere action adventure standpoint but could have used some original writing and realistic fighting scenes
Aug 28 2018,positive,more like mission implausible seriously this is the 6th movie in the franchise at some point you have to wonder if maybe these missions are actually possible unrealistic premises aside this is actually a really good action movie for me its still not up to par with 2011s ghost protocol but you cant deny the pure unadulterated entertainment of this movie the film is a fantastic mix of intrigue and action and you have to pay attention to keep everything straight there is a lot going on and the plot points get pretty muddled just trying to keep up with who is on whose side was enough to make my head spin the nearly constant action sequences serve nicely to distract you from the less than seamless story the movie is packed with car chases sponsored by bmw foot chases fights and incredible stunts sponsored by tom cruise as with rogue nation the players have changed a bit but as long as benji simon pegg is still part of the team im in  he is the heart of these movies and they wouldnt work without him jeremy renners brandt has been unceremoniously deleted without explanation this goround in the same way paula patton was omitted without fanfare after ghost protocol but henry cavill is a worthy replacement as goodbad guy walker this dude has swag that he has never shown as superman and most of the time i was rooting for him now i understand why cavill refused to shave his mustache for the justice league reshoots this is a meatier role in a worthier movie the films weak point is its length  its too long and by the time the climactic action sequence rolls around youre kind of numb to it all but with every installment this franchise has been more and more successful at blending the spy thriller with the action movie which makes these movies rise above the standard shoot em up popcorn flick to become a truly satisfying moviegoing experience
Aug 28 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is a marvel to the action genre which not only proved that any form of film can be hailed as a masterpiece but also was a main catalyst in reforming the academys bias towards blockbusters while a popular film category might be a sorry excuse to exclude movies like this from the best picture category its a start nearly every action scene in this movie was perfectly executed the biggest problem i have with many action movies such as this is that they have a hard time immersing people at least the people i know into the action i have a hard time grasping the stakes and how tense each moment is however this film not only immerses me into the action it makes my heart race and forms goosebumps on my skin during the skydiving scene i legitimately felt as if i were tens of thousands of feet in the air i believe the gem of this film is the bathroom scene as each movement feels important each punch kick etc knocks back characters and harms them its also just precisely choreographed and feels very wellpaced which i think is something most action scenes lack overall this movie is a masterpiece and everyone should see this film now
Aug 28 2018,negative,zero originality im convinced critics are paid off it was the same movie with nothing new
Aug 28 2018,positive,great visual effects and amazing car chases
Aug 28 2018,positive,the best action movie ive seen all year ive not seen such an intense action movie ever since mad max fury road the stunts are believable and aweinspiring because tom cruise is actually performing them by himself which makes for great action setpieces my favorite action sequence was the helicopter chase in the finale which to be honest is the best finales ive seen in 2018 in regards to the mission impossible movies i like almost all of them except 2 but this has to be the best in the series the plot maybe an issue for some people as its a bit hard to follow if you dont pay attention but i like the fact that the movie is not just a collection of mindless action sequences but it requires you to invest in the plot the issue with the mission impossible movies has often been the villain but here we got the second best antagonist in the series after phillip seymour hoffmans character in mi 3 all in all if you love good action setpieces go watch this movie if you like good spy thrillers go watch this movie if you love film in general go watch this movie guys
Aug 27 2018,neutral,decent enough action and stunts but bland same old mi formula despite cruise doing his own stunts and getting hurt on set  cannot salvage this movie to a must watch ensemble acting is weak as well
Aug 27 2018,positive,one of the better films in the franchise stuck to the tried and tested formula but just bigger and better     the people giving it 1 star and having a rant seem like the sort of people that i would avoid in real life
Aug 27 2018,positive,spoiler alert  i did not think they could top rogue nation so i was a bit skeptical with this film holy cow did they make me look like a fool   pros  the action scenes are masterfully shot and are some of the best since mad max fury road and rogue nation a particular helicopter chase scene first comes to mind this is a film hat needs to be seen in the theaters i was literally on the edge of my seat  they made solomon lane who i thought was an underwhelming antagonist and made him one of the best  the whole cast is great as usual special shoutout to henry cavill  the score is absolutely spectacular  cons  some of the story feels recycled and unoriginal i really didnt find this that disappointing but this might be to some  hats off to christopher mcquarrie and the whole team behind this movie this may not be the best film but it is my personal favorite and every kind of moviegoer should see this film
Aug 27 2018,positive,just a lot of fun with tom cruise charisma
Aug 27 2018,positive,tom cruse is the mission impossible watching the stunts and the action of this film is not only stressful and exciting but actually having emotional stakes not found in any of the other installments   saw it with my mother and she loved it a move for all ages
Aug 27 2018,positive,action packed  but a sequel is a sequel with aging tom cruise
Aug 27 2018,positive,this was fantastic and full of action loved it 
Aug 27 2018,positive,i unfavourably compare this movie to the fast and the furious series at least the fast and furious movies could see their own asinine reflection and laugh this movie made tom cruise look tall and thats wrong hes not dumb the two non psychopathic love interests only characteristic were that they were weirdly devoted to dumb cruise who is not tall good if you want to watch a car ad for over two hours and pretend that the 2000s didnt happen it was just so lazy the worst part of it was its laziness it didnt even try to be so bad it was good it was just content to be mediocrely bad tom cruise has no charisma and is dumb    would recommend to all my friends and families
Aug 27 2018,positive,it was great tom cruise always picks interesting projects i will say that it was super easy to pick out the mole before the reveal but that didnt ruin the film one bit
Aug 27 2018,positive,tom cruise returns to mop up the mess he left in mi rogue nation while the plot lacks the ingenuity of other mi films and borders on the extremely predictable prolonged attractive action sequences make up for its failings in many ways
Aug 27 2018,positive,highly overrated in my view predictable storyline nice stunts though
Aug 27 2018,negative,too far fetched story line that was impossible to follow and did not make any sense
Aug 27 2018,positive,tom cruise is still a douchebag lets just clear that up first that being said great movie and he did a great job albeit his acting never changes never 
Aug 27 2018,positive,i think it is the best of the series really enjoyed it except for anything with alec baldwin he was pretty bad
Aug 27 2018,positive,great movie tom cruise is great in it
Aug 27 2018,positive,this is definitely the best movie of the summer if not the year so far these movies just keep getting better and better great action great stunts and tom cruise has never been better he just keeps upping the ante in what he is willing to do to entertain us definitely see this in imax if possible 
Aug 27 2018,positive,best action flick in a long time highly recommend watching on the big screen
Aug 27 2018,positive,its tom cruise shattering an ankle to deliver another great movie 
Aug 27 2018,positive,shockingly good clever writing
Aug 27 2018,positive,the best action movie ive ever seen extremely entertaining and interesting 1010
Aug 27 2018,positive,i had no idea this was a 2 12 hour movie until i came out of the theatre and it was dark it moves so fast it seems much shorter
Aug 26 2018,negative,very boring long and tiring tom cruise should retirehe is old the rest of the cast is not memorable the plot is a joke and anticlimatic especially when the tension should have been built upthe writing sucks  they keep having the characters explaining the plot to the audience during the moviewhich i found very very strange  usual elicopters motorbikes and fist fights and nice shots of london and other locations
Aug 26 2018,positive,thé first watch left me an impression of nearperfection everything music jokes action dialogue surprises fits where it has to fits its fresh fun to watch and clean in other word  neat thie team begins to be familiar with the franchise they know what to put and when to put it a little bit like marvel they have a formula but they are good at it   go watch it
Aug 26 2018,positive,fun action despite having tom cruise in it
Aug 26 2018,positive,awesome  constant action best mi movie yet
Aug 26 2018,negative,pros good action scenes cons story line with zero originality characters and every major event had at least 2 twists which made it extremely obnoxious and try hard another garbage hollywood blockbuster movie thats ment for a dumb audience
Aug 26 2018,positive,a film to beat its predecessors the insane originalactor stunts and high tension fights will serve its purpose in leaving you on the edge of your seat while it may have been back and forth in the past this film solidifies itself above the modern 007 films
Aug 26 2018,negative,most unrealistic stupidity ive ever seen all i did was laugh throughout this movie i mean i know its mission impossible but seriously this movie is a joke way too long and is nothing short of a disaster how is it possible that this movie gets the biggest reviews better than other epic movies well they must have paid the reviewers because nobody with half a brain would think this is a good movie worth 96 this one is rotten all the wayi give it 25 at best and im still being generous utter crap
Aug 26 2018,positive,one of the great action movies that youll soon in 2018
Aug 26 2018,positive,totally worth it you must see it
Aug 26 2018,positive,exciting and fastpaced
Aug 26 2018,positive,theres too much going on in this movie but still manage to tied every detail and storyline smoothly is the impossible task which mcquarrie achieved it i still love mi5 rouge nation more but mi6  is the one of the perfect action film of this decade maybe of all time
Aug 26 2018,positive,this movie is great im pretty much speechless if you havent seen it yet youre missing out i promise you will not be disappointed
Aug 26 2018,positive,this is a really good movie  for me it is the best one in the franchise  i gave up on tom cruise especially after the mummy movie  but i was very surprised in a good way  the movie kept me entertained and the story moves along perfect  building up to the final scene which was very intense  i had to watch this movie 2 times and i cant wait till it comes out on dvd or digital download  the movie 147 minutes but it really doesnt feel like a long movie  the only one thing i can honestly point out and say i did not like it  was the extended tom cruise running  i think that is the only thing that they could have cut some time on  oh and rebecca ferguson is perfect in this movie and i was happy she reprised her role
Aug 26 2018,positive,absolutely phenomenal fantastic ride great twists entertaining and engaging through and through so so great
Aug 26 2018,positive,another great action movie by mark 
Aug 26 2018,positive,i didnt think i could be entertained by another watch tom cruise run for several scenes movie i was wrong great summer blockbuster worth watching in the movie theater

Aug 25 2018,negative,booorrrrring and long
Aug 25 2018,negative,fell asleep movie was super boring
Aug 25 2018,negative,it was mission impossible i knew it and i paid and went i got what i asked for  it was so long and terrible  i expected what to solve world hunger or cure cancer or what ever but i got a 2 and a half crap fest of a half baked slap stick action flick where people catch bullets with their teath and do back flips while shooting  o and they handle plutonium loads by hand i think this film actually got me angry and embarrassed that i even went  horrible horrible dumbing down of cinema and cultural products  i think i shrank 3cm shorter after watching this
Aug 25 2018,positive,incredible action tom cruise is brilliant
Aug 25 2018,negative,way too long overall each scene longer than needed almost fell asleep
Aug 25 2018,positive,i love the way tom cruise runs and boy does he run in this movie great story line great action and good characters cant wait to get it when its released so i rewind and watch tc run over and over again
Aug 25 2018,positive,this is the best actionpacked movie i have seen in a very long time  its one heartpounding overthetop action scene after another almost from start to finish
Aug 25 2018,neutral,how on earth could this mediocre movie get that score  watch mission impossible 3 instead
Aug 25 2018,negative,ive never been compelled to write a review until today  if it wasnt for the  40 and two large popcorn id invested in i would have left the cinema how do you describe an overhyped fakebought reviewed scam of a movie  this is coming from the guy who has seen and enjoyed such horrible movies as bring it on 5keep bringing it  so please dont pass this off as a jaded critiques rant im a normal bloke who almost wanted to demand his money back at the end of the show   this movie has also ruined my faith in review platforms like imdb and rottentomatoes  whats the point of their existence if its going to be filled with payed for movie reviews  please dont try and tell me that mission impossible fallout scores 97better than the dark knight harry potter skyfall all of the star wars movies  wtf when the first movie only managed 64 what the utter fk does anyone else think its a co incidence that the ratings for mission impossible franchise have rapidly increased over the years   the acting is shit the plot makes 0 sense and even the action sequences are poor except the one where tom cruise actually broke his leg in real life maybe he was actually trying to jump off that building before this hit the cinemas   if you want to watch an action spoof go and watch macruber which is intentionally trying to make fun at action movies please dont watch this movie
Aug 25 2018,positive,one wordwow  should be an oscar contender
Aug 25 2018,positive,surprisingly the best one yet i had thought that since this is the sixth entry to the series that it would be dull and out of ideas i was wrong for sure the movie was a little long but every minute of it was still enjoyable
Aug 25 2018,positive,about as good and suspenseful as an action blockbuster can get
Aug 25 2018,positive,probably the best one of the many so far i enjoyed it from start to finish and even though you can sense how it ends you sill are kept on the edge of your seat the action was very good and tom cruise was superb loved it
Aug 25 2018,positive,a film thats narrative holds the action scenes together and every scene is as important and entertaining as the last
Aug 25 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout  the older you get the better you get

Aug 24 2018,positive,is this the best installment of the franchise yes it bloody is
Aug 24 2018,positive,fantastic movie from start to finish possibly one of the best in the series im super happy the last 3 have been so good
Aug 24 2018,positive,great action cringeworthy writing and uninspired plot
Aug 24 2018,positive,some scenes are predictable but the insane stunts plot twists and beautiful set pieces make for yet another amazing entry to this solid franchise
Aug 24 2018,positive,definitely enjoyed this much as ive enjoyed all the recent mission impossible movies was a tad predictable but i liked it 
Aug 24 2018,positive,similar to other mission impossible movies 
Aug 24 2018,positive,thrill a second movie 100 would see again
Aug 23 2018,positive,the sixth entry in the longrunning series mission impossiblefallout continues the films running streak of escalating quality in action direction and presentation every aspect of fallout feels like its been polished up since the last film resulting in an unrelenting adrenalinesoaked thrill ride that never fails to impress with every new scenario and set piece   a nice touch to fallout is that it uniquely brandishes itself as a true sequel to many of the past films in the franchise apart from some recurring characters such as simon peggs benji and ving rhames luther  the films have mostly played themselves out as a series of standalone episodes in relation to each other fallout makes some notable connections to ethans previous missions especially the last entry rogue nation the apostles are a natural extension of rogue nations syndicate and rebecca ferguson alec baldwin and sean harris reprised roles as well as the first returning director in the series christopher mcquarrie give the film a pleasantly weighty boost in continuity the film also works perfectly well as a standalone to boot   also returning is tom cruises unmatched vigor for the action hero roleits clear how much cruise relishes the part as he yells runs jumps and shoots across the screen with all his might his genuine allin attitude continues to play a large part in selling the character and the franchise as a whole  furthermore cruises fearless stunt work is elevated to the nth degree through mcquarries direction and rob hardys breathtaking cinematography mcquarries mature style carries over from rogue nation with engaging beautifully crafted visuals that few action films ever allow themselves to present the stiller moments always have something going for them and when bullets start flying the film has some of the best action in the series bar none   featuring a mesmerizing halo jump shot in long takes a brutal closequarters bathroom fight one of the best car chases put to film and topped with a hightension helicopter brawl everything looks real because it is real theres no trace of computergenerated embellishment to the ridiculous stunt work done in camera fallout is a true achievement in pure practical filmmaking and alongside 2015s equally ambitious mad max fury road it goes to show how much better movies can turn out when done with this very real level of effort  on another gripier note fallout lacks any trace of depth of substance apart from its mindblowing action its not like it needs it the film delivers exactly what it promises with masterful execution its also the longest entry in the series at nearly twoandahalf hours but thats also not as much a complaint as it is another observation   mission impossiblefallout is another fantastic addition to the series that takes the already high bar set by its predecessors and sets it another two pegs higher
Aug 23 2018,positive,tom cruise kicking ass and looking anxious awesome 
Aug 23 2018,positive,such an action packed movie this good deserves a heck yeah in my books overall this movie was great
Aug 23 2018,positive,tom cruise never fails me
Aug 23 2018,positive,out of the sequels this is my favorite
Aug 23 2018,positive,a really predictable plot but i didnt expect much better i expected a fun action movie and that is what you get just go and watch tom cruise try and kill himself in the craziest ways possible
Aug 23 2018,positive,awesome movie definitely best mission yet
Aug 23 2018,positive,simply awesome  one of a handful of films i went to see twice this year
Aug 23 2018,positive,action scenes are great story bof cruise is getting old for that kind of role
Aug 23 2018,positive,action movies are sometimes confusing but this one is better then the last mission impossible part and not confusing i like it very much ps there were sometimes mistakes but i think that is not a proplem because the mistakes were very funny 
Aug 23 2018,positive,this movie is extremely well done it does a good job at filling you in with just enough information from the prior movies that you can go see it without having watched the rest of the series it is also very entertaining watching tom cruise perform his own stunts   definitely worth going to see in theaters
Aug 23 2018,positive,fantastic engaging edge of your seat movie
Aug 23 2018,positive,fun if preposterous action scenes on the big screen easier to follow plotwise than some of the other films in the franchise which is a relief for people like me who have difficulty with plot twists and turns
Aug 23 2018,positive,this is the best action spy movie ive seen in years the motorbike scenes in paris were my favourite
Aug 23 2018,neutral,see tom runsee tom drivesee tom fly and repeat 
Aug 22 2018,neutral,this movie is okay but not better than previous movies im not sure were the good ratings come from but this is not it kinda disappointing and confusing 
Aug 22 2018,positive,great movie nonstop action
Aug 22 2018,positive,masterpiece top level action
Aug 22 2018,positive,best tom cruise movie that i have seen in awhile  fight scenes were amazing you must see it
Aug 22 2018,positive,this movie has everything  this movie has amazing action moments dramatic moments funny sad unexpected it was great to watch    this is definitely another mi movie and its the same ethan hunt it doesnt feel different its a great continuation this movie has a crazy amount of stunts and action scenes and a very small amount of cgi mainly weather effects and gunshots all stunts are real and you definitely worry for the hero because you know he had to do all of that for real interesting point is that there were 2 big actions scenes which didnt have any music and it definitely felt different and i noticed that this movie definitely feels different and it was amazing to watch it i had a lot of great emotions tom cruise is as always amazing the amount of work and risk he put into this movie is more than most actors do in their entire career hes definitely an example for other actors and hopefully more actors will start making movies with a similar dedication i watched this movie in 4dx format and it made it even more realistic i definitely recommend it after that i watched it twice more in 2d    this movie has really a lot of stunts amazing halo jump scene fighting scene shooting scene motorbike chase scene car chase scene amazing intense tc running scene helicopter chase scene its absolutely amazing stunts and all done with no cgi and 100 tom cruise
Aug 22 2018,neutral,not as good as earlier versions
Aug 22 2018,positive,this film was something i was sceptical about at first  i dont usually like action however this film became my favourite film every and would 100 recommend to anyone  there are parts that make you jump but you are constantly wondering what will happen next and it made me feel a mixture of emotions and thats when you know you have got a good film  story line was really good and the acting was excellent a must watch 
Aug 22 2018,negative,heavy handed and just over the top about everything
Aug 22 2018,positive,amazing movie great fight scenes and great action scenes kept me on the edge of my seat
Aug 22 2018,positive,lives up to its name
Aug 22 2018,positive,of the mission impossible movies ive seen i think this one is my favorite i havent seen them all possibly because henry cavill is in it fast paced plenty of action and twists fun dynamics between characters the chase scenes in paris well done the martial artist in the restroom was good helicopter battle and final dukeout quite dramatic of course you know how it ends    i like that ethan hunt and julia finally get  some closure that he really needed at long last he has peace about her    questions for next time did august walker survive now that he has closure with julia will ethan find love    lastly i watched cast interviews about the making of this they said tom cruise did a dangerous stunt without safety  measures in the making of this putting his life on the line did that make the movie better wellmaybe it was a good scene but fairly short compared to the overall length of moviewas it worth it i think not keep your star alive to make another movie yeah he lived this time but  what about next time     why who knows im guessing adrenaline junkie im guessing there may be good therapy for that dunno before doing it again there is a good question to ask who needs you
Aug 22 2018,positive,there isnt much left to say about mission impossible fallout while overall its not quite as great of a film as youve heard it rates an a when it comes to rousing action the practical stunts are hairraising and its far and away the best film in the franchise you likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster but i will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible    its frantic and fun setting the bar high for mainstream action films featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography when the clock starts ticking theres a thrilling sense of real danger  especially when tom cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter its a visual stunner that isnt burdened with flashy cgi effects which in itself is refreshing    cruise who famously does most of his own stunts shows that hes never too old to be a credible action hero his ethan hunt is flawed but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us hes one of americas last true movie stars and he outdoes himself here the likable supporting players simon pegg rebecca ferguson ving rhames are sadly still playing second fiddle with the exception of henry cavill as a tagalong cia suit    a perfect film its not but its awfully easy to overlook the problems a textbook story the draggy length some nonsensical plot holes alec baldwins distracting and shouty nonperformance because this movie is all about one thing the thrilling action scenes there are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite although i could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work    and thats what audiences will flock to see the plot doesnt really play a significant factor in the creative if mostly unbelievable story and its twists grow from wow thats cool to ridiculous eyerolling whoppers no true lover of action films will care because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words buckle up    a screen zealots review
Aug 22 2018,positive,the best mission impossible movie since the first one
Aug 22 2018,positive,this movie delivers in spades and then some high octane pace terrific cast great plot twists fantastic settings breathtaking action and a very satisfying conclusion my only regret is i wish tc had kissed rf in the final frame instead of the friendly laugh he does fingers crossed for mi7
Aug 22 2018,positive,the action the thrill the adrenaline rush it is all there the stunts are the essence that keeps you nervous on your seat you do not go into this movie expecting memorable lines you go into it expecting to see what crazy nonesense stunt has tom cruise pulled out of the hat this time you definitely get blown away by the constant nonstop action
Aug 22 2018,positive,one of the most intricate plots especially for a bigbudget action movie easily solidifies this franchise as my favorite
Aug 22 2018,neutral,some good chase scenes but falls flat when not in chase scene mode cdw
Aug 22 2018,negative,too much talking between characters 10mins discussions are boring
Aug 22 2018,positive,action packed and super fun but also super predictable
Aug 22 2018,positive,surprisingly soooo good
Aug 22 2018,positive,enjoyed it even though you know that the plot is impossible wait what
Aug 22 2018,neutral,not the best of the mission impossible movies a bit long and repetitive 
Aug 22 2018,positive,best mi filmexcellent go see it now
Aug 21 2018,positive,perfect movie i suggest seeing it
Aug 21 2018,negative,mission impossible more likew mission bad ayyyyyyyyyy this movie has the big sad tom crooz is a short geltleman and hes gettin a lil old for this hes not that fit anyway i mean fallout isnt that already a game that should be suaable fallout deserves to sue them 10 million at least the ushers at my moview theater were very mean and they pulled me out at teh only decent part of the movie the ending adn i dont know why pople told me it was because i stabbed the movie screen but i only stabbed it acouple times people also thought i was being loud exept there was plenty of explosions and louder things in the movie whe nsencse dodes that make11 apperently youtre not suppodes to bring pets into the theatre but cat 1011 is ust a baby and cat 556 was doing her food meow at the trailer so i had to take them theire fur got all over the seats what the movie deserves the theatre experience was terivle movie and the treatment after i had to use the restroom and made sure to leave my cats in the seat so they wouldnt miss anything however they though it was so bad they left the theatre too i mean if cats cant sit still this movie must mbe bad they went home and watched a mpvie worth their time primates of the carivbbean this movie brought me to tears tommy c needs a break this was soo bad i slipped on my tears somehow and the movie theatre carpet was forever stained with my eye makeup all in all dont watch this and if you do dont bring cats dogs are fine bc the y suck like this movie thanks  tomcruisehate4445551111
Aug 21 2018,positive,best movie of the year 2018 its not only a masterpiece but one of the best action movies of all time
Aug 21 2018,positive,id say this was the best mission ever if the last two or three hadnt been so damn good
Aug 21 2018,positive,tom cruise does it again another stellar outing for this franchise easily one of the top 3 films from this series  cruise and cavills on screen performances will have you begging for more
Aug 21 2018,positive,this franchise just keeps giving over the top but still awesome
Aug 21 2018,positive,one of the best mission impossible sequel
Aug 21 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is a fun and laughable film for adults and teens and maybe kids who like 12a films go see it one of the best films this summer definitely worth the wait
Aug 21 2018,positive,this movie was so actionpacked that the theatres projector died part way through the viewing really  it is big loud completely ridiculous and physically impossible  basically exactly what you should have already expected from mission impossible    ps it is a bit long
Aug 21 2018,positive,like the 2 before it it has taken off on something new each time we see ethan again this time although in tough struggle with ghost protocol iv in mind the near end of this piece reaches such a peak figuratively psychologically and physically that you feel yourself shedding as your eyes grow wide a benchmark in modern filming that seeks your attention and isnt afraid to tell the truth as you float weightlessly through its seamless pace
Aug 21 2018,positive,best mission impossible film ever
Aug 21 2018,negative,ultimately monotonous marathon action sequences the preposterousness of which is only only outweighed by that of the plot twists characters and violence that is so cartoonish that when the nemesis character suggests that it would be better if he could prevail so that he could end government sponsored killing i rather thought  hes got a point
Aug 21 2018,positive,best action film since baby driver only downside its long
Aug 21 2018,positive,consistently overwhelmingly and increasingly tense in a good way 
Aug 21 2018,positive,rotten tomatoes is my most trusted website when it comes to movies
Aug 20 2018,positive,to me it could be one of the best action movies i have ever seen
Aug 20 2018,positive,theyre all good but i think this one is the best yet the mission impossible team always has some great tricks up their sleeves
Aug 20 2018,positive,i thought this was the best sequel yet it was full of twist turns and excitement from the very beginning of the film ive seen it three times so far and always find something more with each feeling
Aug 20 2018,positive,excellent sequel in the franchise while at the same time creating a new platform to launch even more movies fun and exciting from start to finish with enough twist and turns to keep you guessing
Aug 20 2018,positive,weve seen every mission impossible movie and fallout exceeded our expectations superb action adventure driving  mototcycle scenes special effectts etc excellent acting bravo cast  the movie enthralled from beginning through credits
Aug 20 2018,positive,great action packed movie tom cruise at his finest
Aug 20 2018,positive,im a big tom cruise fan and love  watching the crazy stunts he performs it felt very different than previous mi movies but it was still entertaining the challenges felt more like mission totally possible in this latest installent
Aug 20 2018,positive,absolutely incredible very unpredictable and the twists kept you on the edge of your seat the fight scenes were violent and well filmed and the fact that tom cruise did all his own stunts is baffling 
Aug 20 2018,neutral,amazing action scenes but too much  bmw and a story telling that could suit to a roger moore james bond an atomic bomb must be found and shut off  too old fashion for hunt
Aug 20 2018,positive,quite fun action packed probably the best of the franchise not many slow scenes
Aug 20 2018,negative,clicheevery moment predictable
Aug 20 2018,positive,great movie but more on the predictable side maybe because i have seen all the others seems i have seen enough twists to expect them very entertaining but left me wanting more
Aug 20 2018,negative,completely terrible by far worse movie ive seen in awhile  basically every single thing was extremely predictable tons of scenes he very least would of broken every bone in his body i was ready to walk out of the theater warning at all cost dont see this movie if i could id get my money back
Aug 20 2018,positive,theres a reason these movies do so well the action is outrageous the cast is fantastic and the story is fed to you with a gold spoon 
Aug 20 2018,positive,i havent seen any mission impossible movies  at times the plot twists and i lost track of  who the good guys where and which were bad guys but it did not matter  it was fun
Aug 20 2018,positive,probably tops any previous outing in the franchise for its ridiculousness and its twisty nature but if its not utterly bonkers are you really watching a mission impossible with the return of mcquarrie to the helm we have arguably the most enjoyable mission impossible and for me perhaps the most exciting action film since the raid 2 at this stage this is truly a pleasant surprise and despite feeling a tad heavy on the plot exposition it is full of so much practical stunt work and chase sequences echoing classics from the french connection to nolans batman series some onpoint charm and humour and stunning location shooting its still a joy in time the extended sequence of tom cruise running around londons rooftops and bridges will be a staplepoint in cinema it may not carry the same groundbreaking weight as gene hackman driving after a train at full speed but it is very similar to that scene in spirit and carries in its dna the same sense of gritted determination as with hackmans doyle you really are rooting for ethan all the way as well as showing off a postmillennium london in beautiful proud glory so as to make for a classic moment in film history  guaranteed
Aug 20 2018,positive,exactly what i was after from an mi film
Aug 20 2018,positive,i feel is was the best movie i have seen this year
Aug 20 2018,positive,actionpacked breathtaking stunts
Aug 20 2018,positive,lots of fun perhaps a bit predictable but who cares toms still got it and that theme musickapow always fantastic
Aug 19 2018,positive,more twists and turns than an unconscious freefalling skydiver
Aug 19 2018,positive,ok as expected but film could easily have been one hour shorter i almost left early
Aug 19 2018,positive,for me it lacked a bit of action many sections i found my self bored
Aug 19 2018,positive,the trademark formula of any mission impossible is the mission going wrong and an action packed race against time filled with twists and suspense is set in motion to set everything right     its action packed old school spy thriller if compared to any other movie filled with cgi and special effects even when the plot seems far fetched its still thrilling to watch from the start until the end withouth forced romantic subplots an with lots of breathless stunts     different from james bond ethan hunt is an agent that improvises keeps the deathdefying scenes visceral energetic and insanely awesome if you go to the movies for pure entertainment mission impossible fallout is worth the ticket to watch it the big screen of any theater
Aug 19 2018,positive,well if u dont see this movie youre a jerk  simply outstanding
Aug 19 2018,positive,not the best mi movie henry cavills character is predictable and wasted 
Aug 19 2018,positive,movie had a great sense of tension up until the final act where it crumbles and becomes every other action movie with all the cliches coming in like the director is checking them off a list or something an otherwise good action movie with a disappointing final act that failed to retain my suspension of disbelief which do movie had done well up until that point
Aug 19 2018,positive,exactly what you expect in a movie like this  lots of action beautiful women ridiculous stunts  the plot is totally convoluted but who cares  its a fun movie that youll forget about 5 minutes later
Aug 19 2018,positive,mission impossiblefallout is quite possibly the greatest action movie of all time and definitely the best of the last decade the stunts are real and deliver breathtaking moments a standout character is henry cavills august walker who has great chemistry with tom cruises ethan hunt furthermore sean harris solomon lane has improved over last time and feels like a match for the imf ving rhames is given a lot more to do in this movie and he is an absolute delight as per usual simon peggs bengi dunn is delivering hilarious lines but also has a new layer of depth to him christopher mcquarrie proves yet again that he is the master of action filmmaking i highly recommend you go see the latest impossible mission as tom cruise proves that he is still at the top of his game
Aug 19 2018,positive,acting was great the writing and story took some great unexpected turns the action was exciting the whole movie was cool and fun
Aug 19 2018,positive,the mi franchise just keeps getting better and better while i prefer rogue nation a bit more fallout is amazing as well
Aug 19 2018,negative,i literally groaned during this movie laughably ignores all aspects of reality but only in the parts that have cruise in them so thats all of them spoilers ahead cruise head smashes a bathroom sink but hes only mildly stunned those rubber masks right out of scoobydoo this movie is an insult to any thinking person alec baldwin fights a hired assassin 40 years his junior yeah right a waste of money
Aug 19 2018,neutral,yawn i could so easily have left half way through the whole franchise has got a bit tired now and this was such a complicated story to follow or maybe i just wasnt in the mood
Aug 19 2018,positive,having seen and enjoyed all the previous mi movies in my opinion this one stands head and shoulders above them all words cannot do it justice loved it go see it
Aug 19 2018,positive,im not really into the mi franchise but this movie was simply amazing simon pegg is the reason i went but the whole cast is the reason i loved it the only thing that needs to be said is  just go see it
Aug 19 2018,positive,good pacing many scenes implausibly set up alot of well done action entertaining but not much substance this movie is so action packed that you dont realize how stupid the plot is
Aug 19 2018,positive,best action movie of the year
Aug 19 2018,positive,as good as the first time to get back to the mi series
Aug 19 2018,negative,what is the point of this movie just action no stop with so cheesy plot its just another cash grabbing franchise
Aug 19 2018,positive,wachable and entertaining but not the best in the series 
Aug 19 2018,positive,best movie of the year so far
Aug 18 2018,positive,very very very very good movie best mi out of all
Aug 18 2018,positive,i love it it was amazing 
Aug 18 2018,positive, vary good had you on the edge of ur seat and a lot of crisscrossing throughout the movie 
Aug 18 2018,positive,one of the best action movies of the year
Aug 18 2018,positive,an incredible movie ever
Aug 18 2018,positive,awesome sounds weird to say but tom cruise is a top shelf movie action hero
Aug 18 2018,positive,action packed and left you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie outstanding
Aug 18 2018,positive,what an awesome movie this was it kept you on the edge of your seat for most of it 
Aug 18 2018,positive,for the first time in the history of this franchise previous installment helmer christopher mcquarrie returns to bring us a direct sequel to his critically acclaimed hit rogue nation and yet if you didnt know it you wouldnt initially think that because he has adapted a very different style for this followup and in the process has created one of the best action movies ever made    fallout is by far the series best and yes i realise we say this almost every time a new installment rolls into theaters but mcquarriecruise and co really outdid themselves this time around with stunts that many filmmakers will try to match in the coming years    the story might seem complex on the surface but once you deconstruct it to its core it is nothing more than a straightup revenge story and it delivers a strong enough narrative to keep the film going    it is the action that is front and center here and for good reason  chris mcquarrie rob hardy dp and eddie hamilton editor is a dream team functioning in the highest gear with hardy capturing some spectacular wideshots and hamiltonmcquarrie cutting sequences together in such a way that they dont become exhausting but remain exhilarating all the way through    as for cruise he is great and believable as always but if youre looking for a deep character study this isnt the film for you    to sum it up i can see some people getting turned off by the story but other than that there is no excuse not to see this film
Aug 18 2018,positive,tom cruise knocks it out of the park best mi movie yet
Aug 18 2018,positive,one of the best mission impossibles 
Aug 18 2018,positive,great movie with thrillers and out f the seat content
Aug 18 2018,positive,710   good action film  a few surprises action scenes  fights car chases struggles went on too long becoming tedious   what will he do in the next in this series
Aug 18 2018,positive,one of the best of the series very entertaining 
Aug 18 2018,positive,tom risks his life and limb to entertain us the action sequences are mind blowing mi 6 is absolutely engaging that you dont want to blink your eyes and miss anything
Aug 18 2018,negative,one of the worst tom cruise movies ive ever watched
Aug 18 2018,positive,dynamic fun what you would expect from mi recommended if you dont take action films too seriously 
Aug 18 2018,positive,best movie of the summer by far
Aug 18 2018,negative,this video sums up my views exactly  
Aug 18 2018,positive,tom cruise man action perfected
Aug 18 2018,positive,damn that was a really good movie
Aug 18 2018,negative,the world is once again safe due to tom cruise showing his shiny white teeth very meh plenty of over acting ludicrous stunts and plot holes so big you could drive a tank through just another excuse to milk the mi cash cow and add more to cruises over inflated ego
Aug 18 2018,positive,honestly felt terrified for some of the characters the action scenes felt real and intense there was a human aspect to the characters that persisted even when they were up against impossible trials it had my attention until the very end
Aug 18 2018,negative,the action sequences in this movie are really good i admit it  but the actual storytelling is flimsy because its all cardboard cutouts  taking a cue from the narrative structure of video games the movie shifts abruptly from chase scene to chase scene broken up by short bursts of pure exposition thank goodness for these committee meetings  the characters are onedimensional caricatures and the plot is driven by a series of arbitrary situations predictably explained and then solved by our hero  the situations twists and solutions are equally out of the blue and ridiculous  the reveals in the larger plot are sadly circular and selfreferential  it turns out that office politics petty revenge and incompetence are the main motivators  i had some hopes for this movie because the trailer seemed to be playing up a lot of stumbles by ethan hunt but that feeling didnt make it into the movie instead he is a demigod that can literally do any physical mental or skillbased task better than anyoneand thats pretty boring  but those action sequences are cool
Aug 18 2018,positive,i didnt this movie was as good as rogue nation with that said it is one of the better mission impossible movies
Aug 17 2018,positive,solid movie with good twists and turns
Aug 17 2018,positive,the battles are crazy and mindblowing making this an epic movie
Aug 17 2018,positive,i was really excited to hear that another mission impossible movie was going to be released but i was shocked about how good this installment was probably one of the best movies ive seen in 2018 mission impossible  fallout was full of action and twists i also want to add that the actors in this movie were phenomenal the plot was simply great my heart was pounding throughout the entire movie i would have to say my favorite thing about mission impossible  fallout was that even though it was a fastpaced action film there were parts in the movie that were funny and thats how i know it is a really good movie that there can be a good balance of comedy drama and action i definitely recommend seeing mission impossible  fallout
Aug 17 2018,positive,thrilling edge of your seat never ending action loved every minute
Aug 17 2018,positive,one of the best mi saga ezcellent
Aug 17 2018,positive,amazing tom cruise does it again  only even better
Aug 17 2018,positive,one of the few action franchises that seems to have gotten better with age great action scenes a serviceable plot line that keeps you engaged if not enthralled and entertaining side characters to distract from the fact that ethan hunt has the personality of a wooden plank with eyes drawn on it its doubtful ill remember the finer points of the plot a few weeks from now but the action set pieces are all incredible cinematic moments personally the bathroom fight is my favorite see this thing on the biggest screen you can
Aug 17 2018,positive,in my opinion all the movies in the saga mission impossible this is the best my favorite  it remembers the old 007 as it is full of twists action adventure comedy and drama christopher mcquarrie is incredible the only director who has worked more than once in the mi series tom cruise and henry cavill are spectacular watch it
Aug 17 2018,positive,loved the stunts and developing storyline possibly the best in the series the scenes filmed in new zealand were stunning
Aug 17 2018,positive,i only went to see this for simon peg and henry cavill but hot damn this was the best mi of the bunch i really enjoyed the movie
Aug 17 2018,positive,a real adrenaline ride swashbuckling fun loved it dont take it seriously just enjoy
Aug 17 2018,positive,first of all we can appreciate the great work of very recognized actors like tom cruise henry calville simon pegg among others this actors really make you feel what the script is suppose to make feel to the watching  public i really appreciate actors that live their characters between their bones     however the story has the same plot and actually also the same resolution as the previous mission impossible movies but on the same side we can say that this series of movies distinguish themselves because of the sequenced plot and resolution in which the good ones always win the fight or in this case the misison     also i was amazed by the special effects and training of the actors which made feel like i was on the movie it has great images resolution and also it has this soundeffects that really creates an intense feeling    in conclusion i give 5 stars to this movie because of the enjoyable moment it made me experience and well because of all that was mentioned previously i really recommend it
Aug 17 2018,positive,for a franchise that is in its 6th instalment its impressive that it might actually be getting better the first film that ties in really well with the last films and that is also a big plus great action a good story and terrific acting makes this one of the best movies this summer
Aug 17 2018,positive,another solid installment of a classic action franchise many parts of this film are very traditional are predictable but this film embodies simple summer blockbuster fun not anything groundbreaking its not my favorite movie franchise but you know what youre getting which is a solid action flick so i will definitely be in line for the next one
Aug 17 2018,positive,very actionpack and with great preformences
Aug 17 2018,positive,if you like mission impossible movies the go see this one if you like action go see this one if you want a completely believable plot well hard to have that and an imf movie definitely worth seeing on the big screen
Aug 17 2018,positive,your next mission if you choose to accept tom cruise is back as ethan hunt with this action packed thrill ride mission impossible fallout after seeing many mission impossible movies you think that these movies would loose viewers attention instead fallout does not come 1 second short of being a great addition to the series the actors all did an amazing job the explosions and the interesting storyline made this movie such an enjoyable theater experience i cant wait to see how tom cruise will top this mission impossible in the next movie 
Aug 17 2018,positive,the best action movie ive ever seen check it out these guys deserves it

Aug 17 2018,negative,really 97 its just more of the same the plot is some waffle about radioactive orbs and theres some fancy setpieces tom looks old and rhames and pegg phone it in only cavill seems remotely alive this is a very overraised competent but utterly pedestrian entry
Aug 17 2018,positive,gorgeous cinematography and sets lots of emotional weight great actor perfomances the cast is very bloated though hard to keep track of every character
Aug 17 2018,positive,the mission should you chose to accept it is to figure out who the hell is john lark within 15 minutes of missionimpossiblefallout and try not to cry when you see julia clue it is not ethan  hunt this message will self destruct in 5 seconds 455scales
Aug 17 2018,positive,great movie great action some good comedic releif at the perfect time all around it was a great movie except for the fact that unlike all the other movie you didnt need to pay any attention to figure out who was going to betray hunt the attention to details that are so just clear and obvious was a little annoying 
Aug 17 2018,positive,great movie definitely recommend seeing this in theaters 
Aug 17 2018,positive,straightup entertainment 
Aug 17 2018,positive,when talking about tom cruise movies one has to put personal opinions aside and judge him solely on his dedication tom is arguably the most consistent action star of all time  he is the real deal and his stunts have you on the edge of your seat made for the fans
Aug 17 2018,positive,awesome movie the best mission impossible yet 
Aug 17 2018,positive,a movie that shatters action in each and every dimension
Aug 17 2018,positive,predictable but in a good way i enjoyed the movie throughout loads of action some prettt crazy as can be expected from tom cruise lots of comedy as well cavill was good in it as well
Aug 17 2018,positive,its not an exaggeration to say this is one of the best action movies ive seen not a moment is wasted action is thrilling and amazingly choreographed with impeccable performances this will be the current action film to be beat as it is maybe the best film of this year so far
Aug 17 2018,positive,if you like action suspense and twists this is a movie you should see the stunts are really great characters are engaging and gets you connected great movie 
Aug 16 2018,negative,very good up until the last 25mins which was awful it should of just ended twist twist twist boring

Aug 16 2018,positive,as good as popcorn entertainment gets my only complaint against myself is that i definitely needed to rewatch the others before seeing this one as this is the first movie that starts to tie all of the other ones together
Aug 16 2018,positive,loved the movie chase scenes where great just a couple of hard to believe moments ie on the side of the cliff
Aug 16 2018,positive,it has action scenes on par with rogue nation but other than that it has nothing better than it or even ghost protocol overall its a good movie 
Aug 16 2018,positive,very thrilling the whole way through
Aug 16 2018,positive,nice action packed movie if you liked the other mi films you will like this 
Aug 16 2018,positive,tom cruises reliable selfaggrandisement franchise continues as normal mcguffin  red herrings and rubber masks  car chases  explosions  running lots and lots of running its all done very well and the cast are on fine form sadly it doesnt distract from the  narcissistic jungian hero archetype cruise adopts off screen i cannot unlearn the abuses he has inflicted or the crimes his best bud david miscavige has committed in his name this stuff sticks that the films closing monologue is ripped straight out of scientologys system of ethics only compounds my discomfort if youre not familiar with cruises role in his religious organisation then your ignorance will undoubtedly result in bliss when watching this movie for those who are there is still much enjoyment to be had but its creepy youll definitely need a shower afterwards
Aug 16 2018,positive,one of the greatest action films ive ever seen fallout is ambitious fun and wildly entertaining
Aug 16 2018,positive,really amazing and impressive  the action scenes make you fly  mission impossible fallout is perfect

Aug 16 2018,positive,its so full of action that you fall into a mesmerizing  sequence of awake rem
Aug 16 2018,positive,i normally want the most movie for my money but this film would be better if it was 20 minutes shorter  it is not bad but there is nothing special either  some of the plot twists  were not very surprising  enjoy this at home for a few bucks
Aug 16 2018,positive,tom risks his life and limb to entertain us this is a great action movie and it is absolutely engaging that yu dont wanna blink yo eyes and miss nothing 
Aug 16 2018,positive,nearperfect movie full discretion i was exhausted when i saw this so i was a little distracted and will need a repeat viewing but this was still an exhilarating effortlessly stylish thrilling and actionpacked sequel that sets the bar high for the future thanks to an emotionallydriven story offering some of the best character development in the franchise thats supported by a phenomenal performance from cruise
Aug 16 2018,positive,these mission impossible movies may be better than james bond 
Aug 16 2018,positive,so unrealistic but thrilling in every way
Aug 16 2018,positive,perfect summer action flick
Aug 16 2018,positive,mcquarries masterpiece and one of the greatest action films of all time a great blend of plot character interactionsrevelations and brilliants staged and shot action sequences 1010 and a must see in imax

Aug 15 2018,positive,one of the best mi movies this is an action movie that everyone should watch no doubt
Aug 15 2018,negative,childish and cheesy as usual 
Aug 15 2018,positive,fallout may arguably be the best film in the series which is impressive given that this is the sixth one the mi franchise has a remarkable talent for improving itself there is one scene where you can automatically predict how itll turn out however everything was so well edited i was tricked into feeling tense anyway    director christopher mcquarrie has an excellently deliberate sense of shots and pacing with both the suspense and fight scenes the action scenes equally dont disappoint    for a nice change of pace the movie focuses a little more on ethan hunts mindset he finds himself going undercover with dangerous people theres a fair amount of tension and pathos to be mined from his facing the difficulty of trying to be a good man and completing his mission in a flawed murky world    now i wouldnt consider these dealbreakers but there are a couple nitpicks the film is a bit long some of the action scenes do go on and on also it wouldnt have hurt if the plot was a bit more streamlined the middle does feel a little sidequestey
Aug 15 2018,positive,at the time of writing this review i have yet to see rogue nation or really remember mission impossible 13 very well  so with only the knowledge of ghost protocol i went into this film knowing pretty much jack  and damn it didnt really matter  i loved every moment of this film
Aug 15 2018,negative,mission impossibly fucking stupid how is this remotely considered good
Aug 15 2018,positive,fast paced as usual and a number of impossible stunts with a few surprises  enjoyed it
Aug 15 2018,positive,fabulous  best movie ive seen in quite a while  great from start to finish  go see this oneyou wont be disappointed
Aug 15 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time no exaggeration 
Aug 15 2018,positive,great movie will watch again one of the best movies on the series 
Aug 15 2018,negative,a waste of time and money yes its full of action yes it has cool stunts the story line was both predictable and worn the acting was flat and mediocre youll like this if your a meat puppet
Aug 15 2018,positive,great movie i hope they make more
Aug 15 2018,positive,ridiculous fun so many brilliant stunts a slightly rambling script but action doesnt get much better than this
Aug 15 2018,positive,the best and phenomenal movie of all time i love that amazing movie
Aug 15 2018,positive,might be the best of the franchise the action is incredible the story is good and the characters are great as usual with mission impossible 
Aug 15 2018,negative,saw it last night in 3d and was so excited to see the various true action sequences esp as a veteran moto racer and accidental stunt guy myself as weve all heard or seen across you tube and on the interwebs but what we did not expect was that from the getgo opening scene the story initiates itself like one of those big backyard fireworks you save to light till the end  the one you spent too much for but just had to and slight spoiler here all the work to reestablish the precision and virtuosoness of the team has king leader just walk 100ft away from the entire movies target to save the world as if it was a discarded innout burger wrapper left on the ground my wife and i groaned outloud and as kirk used to say we then knew we were boldy going where no manwoman has gone before into a land of sheer stupidity determined by stunts and not story and scene after scene with a total lack of storytelling just like infinity wars  suppose this is what people think is good movie making today just a compiled cuts of mismosh predictable dialogue written by a thirteen year old and fifteen or so actors portending that their steely fake looks into camera counts as acting we think tom cruises awesome stunts and all the planning involved distracted everyone from having a true and real story and somehow no one noticed  not even the director apparently  that the great question of why do we care appears rarely asked in modern day action cinema if it was this had the visual chops and misused cast in order to make a story that keeps you in your seat no matter what instead i opted for a bathroom break and another trip for ice cream and a beer and missed nothing but sleepy and obvious dialogue by talented people sing like a sweet lullaby    yeah in the end and last few minutes wife laughed what a climatic ending sarcasm i actually fell asleep please save your money and miss this one in theaters the action on a big screen does not make up for this movies fullout stupity rent in november for 3 and be done with this trashwork double yawn  note i think extreme moto rider travis pastrana and the nitro circus could write better stories leading up to even better stunts
Aug 15 2018,positive,awesome summer time action movie ethan benji and luthor wont let you down a mix of action and jokes takes you on an epic ride to disarm nuclear weapons and includes almost all kinds of transportation in the movie only a train scene isnt included
Aug 15 2018,positive,very good action movie with awesome fight cars and choppers chase i highly recommend this
Aug 15 2018,positive,i dont believe i am speaking in hyperbole when i say this is one of the great action movies ever made i will just leave it at that stop reading this review and go see it on the big screen
Aug 15 2018,positive,extremely entertaing
Aug 15 2018,positive,tom cruise shines this is classic mission impossible tons of great action an intricate but understandable plot a couple rubber masks and about tom at his finest 
Aug 15 2018,negative,i wanted to love this movie i expected the same formula as the previous mis and for the most part they delivered the problem i have is the antagonist it was quite obvious who it was which bore me there were several long slow parts  
Aug 15 2018,positive,perhaps the best mi yet
Aug 15 2018,positive,great action sequences but predictable
Aug 15 2018,negative,such drivel i cant belive the ratings given to this film but then again i think very little of tom cruises acting abilities 
Aug 15 2018,negative,good acting lovely scenery and good visual effects but just like every other mission impossible film yawn
Aug 15 2018,positive,yeah it was good not much to say really 
Aug 15 2018,positive,incredible movie even better than the first one
Aug 15 2018,positive,best misssion yet
Aug 15 2018,positive,not since the 1988 revival of the tv series has mission impossible shown its age  the mi movies have been going at it for 22 years nowso long in fact that metallicas infamous napster lawsuit which is forever tied to this franchise is nearing its 20th anniversary  today tom cruise  ving rhames are getting old  like roger moore in a view to a kill old  it seems like the franchise might need to be revamped with a younger face once again sooner or later  but if that were the case then fallout would be a pretty high note to go out on    mission impossible 6 is one of the grittiest movies in the franchise comparable to jj abrams mi3  for a film series noted for its fastpaced action sequences this one is one of the slowest as wellit puts more emphasis on the espionage and the trickery rather than the walltowall action like in other installments  nevertheless there is enough intrigue going about to keep the audience gripped the whole time plus some very interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot  not to mention that there is a quality over quantity approach to its action sequences which make for the action sequences that do happen being true jawdroppers to behold    remember ilsa faust and the villainous lane from the last movie  theyre back in this one and arguably their arcs in this one are even better than last time  for once we get a greater depth into lanes character and ilsa has arguably the most fascinating character arc in this picture  and then theres the other real scenestealer henry cavill as the mysterious august walker  even though you can see where is arc is going at hindsight hc executes it in a way that makes you want to see him do it  i cant spoil much about his character but it does take a fascinating turn    however i can say this henry cavill is rocking one of the sickest beards to ever grace the movie screen  seriously  the next time you go to a showing of this movie wait for the moment henry cavill graces the screen for the first time and listen closely  you could hear at least one fangirl shrieking in the theater at the mere sight of cavills manly mustache combined with that neat suit that hes wearing  hes a chick magnet of the draco in leather pants variety see tv tropes for what that means the kind of bad boy thatll make fangirls in the audience lose their minds when they gaze their eyes upon him  his beard is so cool in fact that dc entertainment could only shave his face with cgi for justice league  thats how fucking manly he looks    then theres the climaxone of the tensest and most breathtaking climaxes in this whole series  never have stakes so grave been set in such a unique locale for the finale on a scale that seems so small yet actually so great  only one facet of this climax features grand spectacle but the other half is literally a grungy gutpunch  for a pg13 flick half of the final fight got quite dark at times which only made the tension even higher  it is the kind of rewarding finale that punctuates mission impossible 6s continuation of the franchises hot streak after all this time    final verdict  is mission impossible 6 great  fuck yeah
Aug 14 2018,negative,garbage scientology has to be the reason behind good reviews of this trite i do not understand how this movie gets a pass overly complicated garbage plot line which is also somehow predictable with 2030 min segments that could just be removed and have zero bearing on the movie 
Aug 14 2018,positive,best tom cruise movie ever plus best movie of the year
Aug 14 2018,positive,fallout continues to shock audiences everywhere tom cruise is still the unstoppable force for the mission impossible universe 100
Aug 14 2018,positive,this is the best mission impossible movie yet i came for great stunts and good fight scenes and slight intrigue i was not let down henry cavill is a brilliant villain i did keep waiting to hear tom cruise mumble im getting too old for this sht but sadly he will never admit this
Aug 14 2018,negative,how this has such high reviews is beyond me dismal uninteresting boring can i say it again in a different way i can but you get the picture
Aug 14 2018,positive,absolutely incredible from beginning to end and possibly the best mission impossible film to date a lot of incredible action sequences that are even more impressive knowing that cruise is doing most of his own stunts from a brilliant bathroom fight scene to a crazy car chase to a deathdefying copter battle mi6 has it all and still manages to smartly sprinkle in the right amount of humor in the right places mi6 is a blueprint on how to do an action movie right
Aug 14 2018,positive,a really solid film with outstanding action and susepnse and a satisfactory amount of emotional and relationship stakes
Aug 14 2018,positive,sharp clean plot with enough layers to keep audience intelligently engaged while never becoming too confusing or muddled  the pacing was excellent as is the case with most of the mi movies and they always seem to end much sooner than the run time suggests
Aug 14 2018,positive,good movie great action scenes fun to watch 
Aug 14 2018,negative,another prepackaged bs movie movie studios give is some substance 
Aug 14 2018,positive,solid action movie but certainly not the best this is overrated on rotten tomatoes
Aug 14 2018,positive,actionpacked super fast humorous serious and brilliantly entertaining mission impossible fallout remains one of 2018s quinteessential movies with  tom cruise once again delivering on the performance as ethan hunt combine that with a fantastic supporting cast and graphics and wit that few movies ever can recreate this movie is without a doubt amongs the franchises finest installments
Aug 14 2018,positive,not as incredible as everyone says but general good and had incredible stunts some of the chacters were a bit pointless but ultimately a good movie compared to other r spy thrillers
Aug 14 2018,positive,absolutely fucking ridiculous i loved every minute
Aug 14 2018,positive,this is the best one yet plenty of action and great acting a must see
Aug 14 2018,negative,these movies have always strained credulity but this one is just complete crap   im not sure that even the premise of saving the world is a real threat but just for good measure it would be an environmental disaster in a highly contested remote part of the world  the ever interesting bit is that they always seem to have a vital piece of information exactly when they need it which always takes them back to the trail that they perpetually seem to lose   complete crap
Aug 14 2018,positive,pure entertainment nothing too memorable overall but the actors are all good and so is the action
Aug 14 2018,positive,best actionadventure movie since mad max fury road
Aug 14 2018,positive,carrying on the tradition of complicated plot and twists with outstanding action sequence an entertaining action movie
Aug 14 2018,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen maybe best ever in the genre even the slow sequences where you get to breathe are full of tension looking forward to watching it again
Aug 14 2018,positive,quite entertaining i didnt think this series had anymore left in it but this one made it through the ranks
Aug 14 2018,positive,this is the type of movie that will keep you entertained all the way thru i just cant see how people give this movie a bad review a lot of effort into putting this film together great actors and camera work definitely worth it 
Aug 14 2018,positive,if you can keep up join tom cruise on this mission impossible no implausible yes entertaining hell yeah these are some of the most exhilarating chase scenes ive seen since the italian job its the deft balancing of the heroes making believable mistakes then making light of them as they worm their way out of trouble that grounds this magnificent tense movie layer on top some nuanced performances such as vanessa kirby as the devilishly naughty white widow for me another element that cranked the tension was knowing that tom cruise love or hate him as a person does his own stunts this cranked up the tension and added extra spice to otherwise impossible scenes strap yourself in to the largest brightest 4k screen you can find and let the beautifully shot pixels work their voodoo on your cerebellum i promise there will be no fallout
Aug 14 2018,negative,so disappointing really boring movie last 20 minutes some action but a movie within substance
Aug 14 2018,positive,classic mi blockbuster the stunts are bigger wish there was more funny moments like the last few film could been 1520 minutes shorter 
Aug 14 2018,positive,an action movie that has good action and great plot good chatacters what more could you ask  97100
Aug 14 2018,positive,gets better with each one love these movies

Aug 13 2018,positive,action packed and tom cruise was amazing 
Aug 13 2018,positive,mission impossible has always been a mustwatch series and this is certainly an impressive one tom cruises physical capability is still mind blowing other characters are well constructed personally i just love rebecca ferguson so much she is so pretty and tough in the movie
Aug 13 2018,positive,great action some of the twists are predictable but it doesnt ruin the amazing fight scenes and chases the hits feel real and grounded in reality even though tom cruise is jump across buildings and doing inhuman things this movie offers a good variety of new characters mixed with old ones and overall made me leave the theater wanting to be ethan hunt
Aug 13 2018,positive,i couldnt catch my breath the girl friend is a great addition to the cast a tough babe
Aug 13 2018,positive,extremely predictable especially if youve seen previous mission impossible films but lots of fun with great action as usual
Aug 13 2018,positive,not super funny taken serious when needed camera works and the action is amazing tc still killin it
Aug 13 2018,positive,nothing you havent seen before but so much fun that you probably wont care  tom cruise  co return cruise of course once again doing his own stuntsat 56 this time in pursuit of some stolen plutonium that the bad guys plan to use to what else blow the planetor a huge chunk of it anywayto kingdom come  doublecrosses and plot twists galore some truly elaborate chase scenes by land sea and air and an edgeofyourseat finale that races along for nearly thirty minutes and will likely leave you gasping for breath  sure some of the fight scenes are so cartoonishly violent that they defy credibilitysure there are so many good guys and bad guys that youll need a scorecard to keep up with them alland sure some of the acting im talking about you henry cavill leaves a lot to be desiredbut come on the only reason to go to an mi flick is to see the slambang action sequences and this one has em in spades  buckle up kidsits a hell of a ride
Aug 13 2018,positive,since the first film came out in the mid90s the mission  impossible films have set a standard for exciting and thrilling spybased action  as the series progressed the action set pieces have become bigger and the stunts have become more memorable  mission  impossible  fallout is here to raise the bar even higher and do so with fun and excitement  everything from the characters to the story to the movies pacing is done exceptionally well and the action is the icing on top of the cake  the movie is a thrill ride with a side of adrenaline    hello  my name is rev ron and if you feel like checking out more of my reviews including a more indepth look at mission  impossible  fallout you can visit my blog at revronmoviesblogspotcom  also if the mood strikes you can follow me on twitter revronster  thanks

Aug 13 2018,positive,dont usually like tom cruise movies but this one delivers
Aug 13 2018,negative,just another boring action movie  would be much improved by cutting 45 minutes  it doesnt matter which ones
Aug 13 2018,positive,best action movie in years cruise and co keep the thrills coming in a film that leaves you exhausted and grinning ear to ear
Aug 13 2018,positive,new school old school ticking clock action villains were a little cliche

Aug 13 2018,positive,so much action never a dull moment
Aug 13 2018,positive,tom cruise chooses great actors and actresses to play roles in the mission impossible films and the films have always had there viewers on their knees in excitement the romance and bond between the characters is sensational there is always a bit of laughter too and fun and breathtaking action the stunts are the best stunts ever to be done in any film series it dosent matter how old tom cruise is as long as he is still running i will always be watching mission impossible
Aug 13 2018,positive,a seriously perfect action film

Aug 13 2018,positive,this is the type of movie that ill wanna watch again and i left the theatre with a great feeling about what i just watched i didnt feel dissapointed at the end credits
Aug 13 2018,positive,omg tom cruise is 56 and outdoes actors 20 years younger this is a high energy nonstop action well written film tom cruiae continues to impress with his ability to being action films to life a real winner
Aug 13 2018,negative,pathetic we could see all the twists coming a million miles away the casts performance are  unsubtle and very poor which pains for the few good actors lost there incomprehensibly the high scores on this one are just as incomprehensible
Aug 13 2018,positive,its tough to rate the mission impossible movies do you rate them on their own merits or how they serve as part of the whole franchise do you look at tom cruise as ethan hunt as an evolving and aging character like jason bourne or as an ageless character like james bond taken on its own this movie is an incredibly entry in the world of action christopher mcquarrie is now adept at framing his shots and using the camera movement to add motion and kinetic energy to chase and fight scenes cruise as usual is impressive as a man constantly on the move henry cavill and his mustache is a memorable antagonist in this entry     but over the years we have had to raise the bar on our expectations not just from an action movie but from a mission impossible movie rogue nation was spectacular with smart writing and wonderful addition in rebecca fergusons ilsa here the actions of john lark dont seem to stand up to scrutiny when put alongside his goals throughout the movie i was asking myself over and over if he wanted this to happen then why did he do this i was hoping for a payoff but that never came meaning that the villain is more incompetent than he should have been that disappointment is enough to bring my rating down a few notches heres hoping that the next installment is better
Aug 13 2018,positive,under the hot summer it was very refreshing film for me i liked the scenes in paris london and new zealand too however personally i liked the 1st version than any other episode more and more mission impossible focus on actions not the sotry which was much attractive in previous series  and i worred about tom because it looks so dagerous to perform the actions
Aug 13 2018,positive,i love this movie the best of the tom cruise he still have it
Aug 13 2018,positive,best mission impossible by a mile possibly one of the best action films ever
Aug 13 2018,positive,       mission impossible                true movie action hero
Aug 13 2018,positive,another fine addition to this enduring action packed franchise
Aug 13 2018,neutral,typical action flick and yes tom cruise is shoved down our throats even more average at best 
Aug 13 2018,positive,one word amazing a must watch movie
Aug 12 2018,positive,a slick and occasionally gripping actionspy fable that seems to have no conscience whatsoever about repeating chunks of previous better films in the same genre chris nolans dark knight the second and third jason bourne film and of course the daniel craig bond films note his film was skyfall this one is called fallout but happens to focus on skyfall sequences for both of its most complex vfxheavy action sequences the plot who cares in this type of film the plot is always sheer pretense pulp escapism dressed up in the style of greyscale upmarket fashion editorial with a bit of macho nonsense here and there about weapons bikes clues technology etc the action sequences are great and theres a few good bits of dialogue but keep in mind this film is essentially about an escapeanything spy fighting a global unknown killer with a plan to use a deadly nuclear bomb somehow ie mindless generic cheese given a reboot thanks to tight editing breakneck action sequences and yeah chunks of ideas shamelessly lifted from other movies some less than a decade out of circulation
Aug 12 2018,positive,overall mission impossible fallout has delivered an outstanding film remember this is the franchises 6th entry and its awesome to see an action franchise continue to feel this fresh and jam packed with outstanding action sequences that are next level for cinemas today a must watch for those movie lovers seeking a fun ride   finesse movie reviews
Aug 12 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout has several mind blowing action set pieces that push the action genre to the next level tom cruise continues to breath life into this long action series with newer and crazier stunts this is the best mission impossible period henry cavill also gives a very notable performance and is well worth the horrible moustache cgi from justice league the fights are intense and brutal the plot is very similar to other mi movies but apart from that this movie is one of the besr action movies ever crafted
Aug 12 2018,positive,ethan hunt truly is an outlier in todays world    men in masks minimized body count a hero who is pure good rather than a cold calculated good     mission impossible fallout argues fiercely for its preposterous existence in the modern world of cinema and knocks it out of the park    the cinematography is among the best in the series and tom cruise has solidified himself as an action star without equal theres also the rare delectable combination of both megafun new characters and the wellutilized returns of old favorites to date fallout might be the best film of the series at the very least it climbs to the heights of gp and rn against all odds    as it turns out in a world of bleak gritty movie heroes ethan hunt is now oddly refreshing corny catchphrases ridiculous plans and incredible sequences its all at the top of its game here    my lone complaint is that mild spoiler there was no heist in this one but it more than makes up for it
Aug 12 2018,negative,worst movie ive ever seen extremely predictable and illogical toms ego is out of this world and he is the only one calling the shots poor script writing and and the storyline sucked tom needs to let someone else make these movies
Aug 12 2018,positive,one of the better ones will probably watch it again
Aug 12 2018,positive,cruise is one of if not the best action stars ever this addition 20 years after the original is amazing and very exciting its seems each one is getting better and better with a great cast and thrilling action this mission impossible doesnt skip a beat i felt really engaged throughout almost every scene that didnt let up until the last minute excellent movie
Aug 12 2018,positive,yeah its the best mission impossible film  yeah its the best action film of the summer  i might even go as far as to call it the best action film ever made
Aug 12 2018,positive,this movie is filled with exciting action sequences and has a decent plot cruise turns in a great performance in this 6th installment of the franchise see it in imax for the for great sound and possibly 3d imax for the most immersive experience 
Aug 12 2018,positive,this movie is freakin amazing there hasnt been a summer blockbuster like this in a long time and may the mi franchise live forever this is probably the best one so far and with mcquarrie and cruise at the top of their game
Aug 12 2018,negative,good acting and nice action doesnt take away from it being another bomb countdown movie   its overplayed and predictable in every way
Aug 12 2018,positive,amazing  i would see it again
Aug 12 2018,positive,walking out of the theater i was a little disappointed because rogue nation was so amazing but after i week i cant wait to see this again
Aug 12 2018,positive,exciting and intense from start to finish spectacular stunts
Aug 12 2018,positive,excellent enjoyable tom cruise is awesome 
Aug 12 2018,positive,the best action movie of 2018 and the best movie of the whole franchise
Aug 12 2018,positive,as usual tom cruise movies but much better that the last mission impossible
Aug 12 2018,positive,by far the best mi movie they just keep getting better and better
Aug 12 2018,negative,this movie was terrible dont waste your time
Aug 12 2018,positive,best movie since fast five
Aug 12 2018,negative,the reviews for this movie have to be some sort of marketing scam this movie sucks and is the most unrealistic movie ever i want to give this a 0
Aug 12 2018,positive,great facial hair throughout this movie
Aug 12 2018,positive,usual mi fare pure fun great action sequences not sure how a man in his 50s can run 100m pace for 5000m though
Aug 12 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout  it was a pretty decent movie i thought the action seemed a little fake but the stunts were the best of 2018 tom cruise couldnt have been any better in this movie then the last couple of mission impossibles
Aug 12 2018,positive,great funfight scenes and other action scenes terrific
Aug 12 2018,positive,when ghost protocol was released in 2011 that marked the beginning of a bright future for the mi franchise   they have definitely upped the ante on the franchise with this latest creation    add this to your movie collection  when it is released on video
Aug 12 2018,positive,tom cruise does it again in a spectacular action packed film
Aug 12 2018,positive,will be remembered as one of the best action movies of all time 
Aug 12 2018,positive,excellent movie my favorite of all the mission impossible movies the reviews are dead on with this one do not want to spoil any of the good stuff here but definitely check out this one loved the tricks and the humanity tucked into the movie a bit better than past movies
Aug 12 2018,positive,great summer action movie
Aug 12 2018,negative,i guess it has its moments but you cant shake the feeling that this is just two hours and twenty eight minutes of tom cruise gently masturbating just like really unnecessarily dragging it out like like unh unh im better than superman unh unh im still top gun yeaaaaah
Aug 12 2018,positive,tom cruise and the mission impossible franchise are like a fine wine  they get better with age  and you can take said bottle and smash it over the enemys head  riveting action sequences back to back to back fueled by an excellent script with twisting plots
Aug 12 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallouts incredible cinematography edgeofseat action scenes and plot twists and turns make it a truly perfect actionfilm that albeit still remains glued to a familiar yet enjoyable formula while its characters are not as interesting as james bond or jason bourne mis slightly more campy tone makes for some genuinely shocking plot twists it is these moments of sudden shock and realisation combined with stellar action and cinematography that propel the film forward the cast while not the life and soul of the franchise are likeable with simon pegg and rebecca ferguson being the standouts as usual tom cruise pullsoff another stunning reallife stunt also to its benefit fallout unlike the other mi instalments is more connected to the rest of the franchise bringing back old characters and sharing plot lines with rogue nation if continued we can further invest in these characters while fallout doesnt bring much new to the table it successfully delivers a gritty fastpaced sequel with some genuinely surprising moments and an increasingly likeable cast overcoming its now familiar formula
Aug 12 2018,positive,great landscape cinematography  not sure how they achieved some of the action scenes  the first motorcycle chase scene and a few other action scenes were quite memorable  should have been 30 minutes shorter and less smarmy on the attempts at character development
Aug 12 2018,positive,started a little slow but picks up quickly some really great action the action is as good as any movie 
Aug 12 2018,negative,boring cruise looks tired and like he is just going through the motions i love action movies but i walked out on this one horrible 
Aug 12 2018,positive,this is a solid action spy movie as a stand alone film but an amazing 6 th and final entry into the mi series 
Aug 12 2018,positive,with each new film the mission impossible franchise keeps finding ways to exhilarate us more and more with insanely amazing action scenes and in this sixth chapter we are offered a large number of mindblowing explosive moments that should be remembered for their audacity
Aug 12 2018,positive,really captured the impossible but not quite had me catching my breath every other scene lots of interesting surprises a bit confusing with the extensive dialogue at the beginning but perhaps it was necessary to clarify the plot decent touch of the humanitarian element underneath the grand scheme of madness
Aug 12 2018,positive,despite overwhelming dangerous situations and a clear lack of strong themes with a couple of unfortunately missed opportunities in its plot mission impossible  fallout still continues the upward quality trajectory for this franchise thanks to tom cruises crazy dedicated stunt work and henry cavills fantastic addition it is an excessive action flick but its immensely entertaining and exhilarating to watch thanks to brilliantly executed action sequences through and through a great albeit overly loud score and amazing cinematography which makes use of its great cities so well with paris being the definite highlight the standout scenes are the helicopter chase all handtohand combat parts and of course that scenestealing motorcycle chase
Aug 12 2018,positive,i dont think they made enough effort with the helicopter scene at the end
Aug 12 2018,negative,im not sure what everybody else went to see but this movie was not what it was hyped up to be it was not my favorite mission impossible it was not even my second favorite it mission impossible the storyline was horrible the writing and the lines that some of the actors had to deliver or ridiculous i give tom cruise credit for really putting himself out there and doing his own stunts but unfortunately its not enough to make me ever want to see another one of these
Aug 12 2018,positive,another high octane entry in the well known action franchise delivering yet another memorable performance from a great cast the problem has been just a lack of information about all the references and returning characters
Aug 12 2018,positive,better than the last one more action and better plot plus michelle mongohan is in it
Aug 12 2018,positive,even through some parts of the plot was predictibe the pacing and action of the movie was good through out ive got to give it 4 stars as its the best so far in this franchise 
Aug 12 2018,positive,the best yet in the series
Aug 12 2018,positive,two reasons why i watch mi movies  1 watching crazy tom cruise and his egotism is super entertaining  2 guessing which stunts tom cruise was crazy enough to actually do  eg did he just climb that mountain did he just jump out of a window did he get hit by a train did he just lock himself in a cage with a bear    the surprising plot twists were just cherries on top of this cake
Aug 11 2018,positive,see the movie in the big screen for the stunts otherwise its a pass acting was hilariously bad especially baldwin and for that its worth the watchat least for his scenes 
Aug 11 2018,positive,lack of story unlike the other parts of the franchise with amazing visuals and cinematography and tom cruises intense stunts its an adrenaline rush a must watch in the cinemas
Aug 11 2018,negative,it was ok the action was good the story wasnt interesting and the twist was either spoiled by trailers or totally predictable 
Aug 11 2018,positive,loud unappolagetic sleek and sometimes gimmicky everything youd want from an action movie is here and then some  why dont more movies lean into themselves the way mission impossible does i cant call myself a diehard action fan a tom cruise enthusiast or even someone thats seen every mi filmyet i loved every second of mission impossible fallout there isnt a dull moment in the movie and it doesnt seem to run out of steam at any point at several points when you think ethan hunt cruise has the apostles cornered the action ramps back up again and the team reconvenes when a movie is the 6th installment like mi6 its important the film doesnt take itself too seriously and director brian de palma tiptoes that line very effectively the coldopen was one of the best and most fun ive ever seen in an action movie as cruise conspires with wolf blitzer to trick a terrorist into surrendering his phone using a fake newscast when the walls to the fake hospital room raised at the end of the hijinx there was a involuntary smile on the face of everyone in the theatrewe were in    there a really poignant and politically appropriate moment near the end of mission impossible where ethan hunt cruise is asked if they should involve the cia in their plan to save the world ethan replies bluntly the only people i trust are the the 4 people in this room theres certainly a comedic undertone to this scenebut it encapsulated how a lot of people are feeling right now on both sides of the isle in trumps america like theyre just not sure who to trust as with any action movie worth its weight mi6 features four separate twists where characters doublecross each other and youre completely unsure who is on what side the difference for mi fallout versus its lesser counterparts is that the situations and gadgetry used are just believable enough that you could image this happening in thirty years but not so hyper realistic that the audience gets caught in the bureaucratic weeds    the stunts in this film are genuinely inventive and the gutwrenching helicopter scene is something seldom attempted in action movies apparently cruise spent 2000 hours learning to fly helicopters and had cameras specifically designed to show he was truly the one flying the copter  and that the stunts were real during the chase say what you want about toms ego which undoubtedly factored into that decision but the dedication and end result were legitimately impressive    the good its really fun to spend an hour and a half with tom cruise for mission impossible fallout and thats something i never imagined myself writing the stunts are inventive the jokes are timely and well delivered and the plot moved quickly and deliberately though two and a half hours say what you want about cruises involvement with scientology  but the man is very good at making action flicks transgressions aside rebecca ferguson and vanessa kirby were also excellent is supporting roles and probably deserved even more screen time than they got    the bad as much fun as mi6 was theres a strange and unnecessary ten minutes that seems to get added to every cruise film and it was again included here these ten minutes feature a slough of beautiful women approaching cruise while biting down on their lips with lust and read lines borrowed from a lifetime achievement award introduction speech in regards to mi6 it just made no sense why such a sequence was necessarythe audience had just watched a heroic helicopter chase where cruise narrowly beats a 15 second bomb clock and saves the world we already have a deep understanding of the sexual tension between ferguson and cruise because of several other sequences in the movie that alluded to their past
Aug 11 2018,positive,loved it tc does not age 
Aug 11 2018,positive,one of the greatest action movie of all time
Aug 11 2018,positive,enjoyed this movie immensely will definitely look forward to adding it to my collection
Aug 11 2018,positive,a little long but the stunts are spectacular only tom cruise can play this role 
Aug 11 2018,positive,beautiful and brilliant the action sequences were amazing the setting was jawdroppingly beautiful and the plot moved along at a nice pace and was rather easy to follow would definitely recommend
Aug 11 2018,positive,great action pack movie  a bit pridictable at times  dont watch it at the imax in fort lauderdale  screen is too close and seats felt uncomfortable
Aug 11 2018,positive,wow 10 out of 5 stars i couldnt take my eyes off the screen truly tom cruises finest hour would recommend to everyone must see
Aug 11 2018,neutral,frenetic complex confusing confounding and frustrating oh what a tangled web they weave lots of  we know that he knows that we know that he knows so voila resulting in even more huh what but why what well wasnt that convenient 
Aug 11 2018,positive,wow  fantastic story with great action a must see 
Aug 11 2018,positive,tom cruise is still king
Aug 11 2018,positive,enjoyed it from beginning to end cruise ferguson and the entire cast were great a must see
Aug 11 2018,positive,confusing impossible but exciting and overall very entertaining
Aug 11 2018,positive,i had a nice time fortunately i paid half ticket its not a great movie
Aug 11 2018,positive,fantastic  this is the best mission impossible yet
Aug 11 2018,positive,loved the movie  it has amazing cinematography great action good flow of story and its so fun  its everything you want to have when you go out to the movies
Aug 11 2018,positive,another best mi series yet
Aug 11 2018,positive,this movie was non stop action from start to finish  tom cruise has still got it
Aug 11 2018,positive,i thought it was really impressive that this jonra is still strong tom cruise great job
Aug 11 2018,positive,sensational loved it edge of your seat stuff and cruise is incredible
Aug 11 2018,positive,a mesmerizing action thriller from start to finish
Aug 11 2018,positive,every franchise has its ups and downs some very good movies some bad movies some more or less but tom cruise has provided us with a sequence of impossible missions ever better than the other    in fact there is no mystery to creating the films of the serie its a killer cake recipe that mixes absurd scenes twists in the script betrayals a simple story explained right away almost always the good guy has to stop the villain in his attempt to dominate or destroy the world some surprises and tom cruise defying death    and every movie your ethan hunt seems to be over the edge this is how we want it this is how we like it    the great mystery even of mission impossible is like the 56 year old actor has the breath and willingness to do so much exercise in fallout effect tom cruise runs unbeliefly for london with rooftop jumps stars in an impressive chase scene in the streets of paris pilots a helicopter and suffers an accident that would kill anyone in kashmir and still fight with superman all this having to climb a mountain at the end to save a third of the planet china india and pakistan are grateful for their dedication    no wonder luther ving rhames says this is my man     fallout effect is that classic spy story hunt style there is a traitor in the agency you have to find a terrorist you have to prevent plutonium bombs from killing humanity in the midst of all this there is the syndicate a group of terrorists who have been demobilized since the arrest of solomon lane sean harris    the situation in washington is also not very good the imf is questioned after ethan lets out the plutonium warheads to save his friends luther and benji simon pegg because of this the cia decides to put the stick on the table and say now its my way thus they recruit the mustachioed agent august walker henry cavill to be hunts shadow and act more assertively on the mission    from there the plot develops in that climate everyone distrusts everyone even more so after ilsa faust rebecca ferguson comes full of mysteries saying she can not say anything she can not say anything but trust me ilsa this is a world of spies you do not even trust the shade    mission impossible fallout effect is guaranteed fun and keeps the ethan hunt franchise alive it remains to be seen how tom cruise will be able to take risks in ever more surreal scenes especially since each film seems to have to set new limits or keep the previous ones
Aug 11 2018,positive,this one keep the best from the 5 other mi and tom cruise is crazy to do all the stunts
Aug 11 2018,positive,best one out of the franchise left this movie with a six pack it was so intense
Aug 11 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an unrelentingly consistent action movie
Aug 11 2018,positive,somehow didnt enjoy this as much as the previous ones still a solid action movie all around 
Aug 11 2018,positive,this movie was good
Aug 11 2018,negative,a firehose of implausible action sequences that enter your ears and eyes and go directly to your fingers and toes  never mind your cerebral cortex pass the dibs
Aug 11 2018,positive,a fast paced and action packed movie with big set pieces that are amazing and in a few ones breathtaking the kashmir for one and the halo drop this continues the successful run of the mi series thats been more frequently happening gapwise between movies since mi3 i guess to max their box office gross macquarie and cruise collaborate on their 2nd straight mi movie and i cant believe they didnt start with a freaking script wow so action scenes first but i see that despite this fact they made a fairly plausible plot    must watch on imax non 3d to maximize their shots wow
Aug 11 2018,negative,god awful bad acting and boring just another mi movie not worth seeing
Aug 11 2018,positive,it was ok but nothing beats the original series
Aug 11 2018,positive,while it feels a tad bit long mi 6  is still a fastpaced stuntcrazy action thriller with many moving parts that lead to a very wild and satisfying conclusion as ethan hunt tom cruise and his team continue to bring new heights to the franchise
Aug 11 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is one of the best action movies of all time with breathtaking action scenes and a powerful soundtrack that blends in with the scenes mission impossible  fallout is the best film in the franchise
Aug 11 2018,positive,full of twiststurns and fun action scenes fallout feels like a huge thrill ride from the beggining to the end
Aug 11 2018,positive,probably the best of the series
Aug 11 2018,negative,this thing is one big chase scene none of the 3 of us really enjoyed it and the scenes drag out forever
Aug 11 2018,positive,ethan hunt 57 and unstoppable  great action that never stops twisting and turning
Aug 11 2018,positive,great movie i would see it again movie the best mission since the first one best action movie i have seen for a long time 
Aug 11 2018,neutral,not sure why this got a good score but this was not that good compared to the last 2 mission impossibles first of all what idiot  editor decided to put clips of the movie in the title sequence it basically shows all the scenes from the movie i dont want to see that shit at all they also did that in rogue nation the editor should be fired from his job for that no more of that in the next one tom cruise still does his usual stunts and stuff but compared to ghost protocol and rogue nation they are downplayed nothing tops the dubai scene in ghost or the underwater scene in rogue the plot takes you on lots of betrayal and not knowing who to trust they did the same thing like in xmen origins where they rescue some guy and then ends up not worth it at all because he goes rogue the ending is very predictable and you know exactly what is going to happen and the 1 on 1 battle at the end just used mostly cg and was crap compared to the finale from mission impossible 2 mi6 is just not that good and nothing sticks out to watch it again the next one better be better than this
Aug 11 2018,positive,surprisingly good attractive parisian backdrop surprisingly 3 dimensional not confined to action
Aug 11 2018,positive,very good movie well worth time and money great scenes awesome acting
Aug 11 2018,positive,satisfying to watch a beautiful movie
Aug 11 2018,negative,how anyone could give this insulting mess a positive review is beyond me it is unrelentingly stupid without a trace of believability anywhere in site i love ridiculous action movies but this was exhausting everything is as extreme and down to the wire as possible if theres a crash youd better believe the wreckage is going to teeter on the edge if theres a time limit theyll succeed at one second left just like always  i was fully bamboozled by all the positive hype despite my better instincts this series has gone full fast  furious on us  ridiculous constantly over the top action that makes very little sense drama thats meaningless since no one ever gets hurt or dies and a shoehorned in love story that no one remembers this series had been going on for 22 years  or cares about  i was legitimately happy when the movie ended
Aug 11 2018,negative,disposable with poor acting in parts so many eye rolling moments and loss of disbelief lots of fun action but ultimately not a very satisfying movie
Aug 11 2018,positive,really good exactly what you would hope for out of a mission impossible movie
Aug 11 2018,positive,the best action movie of the year tom cruise and director mcquarrie have made the popcorn flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the fight and chase scenes filmed in some of the most beautiful cities in the world the latest mission impossible is the best 
Aug 11 2018,positive,most action i have ever seen in a movie unbelievable and i love it
Aug 10 2018,positive,2 and a half hours of goodness enjoyed every minute of it
Aug 10 2018,positive,great individual scenes but about 30 minutes too long
Aug 10 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout was a blast it had probably the deepest elements of all the mission impossible films and maybe had the best villain in the series but the plot twist that he was the bad guy was not surprising because it had been reveled he still was a really great villain
Aug 10 2018,positive,i think this is the best of what has been a great series it has a little more twist to go with the excitement  the whole team is back  and they even added superman 
Aug 10 2018,negative,great action sequences and nothing else some of the dialog was so lame i actually winced during the movie  come on hollywood cough up a few bucks for decent writers
Aug 10 2018,positive,best mi yet it had a grittiness similar to a jason bourne movie 
Aug 10 2018,positive,bring your adrenaline youre gonna need it  by all accounts the mi franchise should have run its course by now after all few movie franchises succeed beyond their first three films and its main star tom cruise is now 56 a time when most people start dreaming of retirement yet mi fallout feels original fresh and youthful arguably the best mi movie yet  the premise of the film is not too complicated  bad guys steal nuclear weapon fuel good guys try to get it back its an old chestnut that has been the basis for plenty of action films including the rival bond series thankfully mi fallout takes an original route cleverly sculpting characters and elements from the preceding film rouge nation into a new storyline that explores the fallout from the actions of the impossible missions force it is sometimes hard to know who is a good guy and who is a bad guy but there are plenty of clues hidden in the film to help you work it out  director chris mcquarrie brings a touch of james bond glamour to many of the scenes and lorne balfe has crafted a rousing music score that perfectly supports the various scenes  the nonstop incredible action sequences are the heart of this movie and they will have you clutching your seat in angst cruises decision to perform many of the action sequences as his own stunt double just like he did in previous films definitely pays off giving plenty of realism to the film you are left wondering if he was born without a sense of heights the filmmakers have left the footage taken when cruise jumped between two buildings actually breaking his ankle on set in the final movie the cutaway shot of him limping away immediately afterwards is painful to watch though not as painful as it would have been for mr cruise but it just sums up how much tom cruise was willing to give to make this film as good as it can be  mission impossible fallout is a great ride from start to finish if mi fallout is anything to go by it is clear there is plenty of life left in this franchise they are up to the 26th bond film which is still going strong five stars
Aug 10 2018,positive,another great installment in the franchise great fun and brilliantly executed however i didnt find it as engaging as mi rogue nation i felt they shouldve placed more emphasis on the characters and relationships and perhaps toned back some run time on the action scenes despite how enthralling and clever they were but nonetheless a great ride and a sterling example of how an action film should be looking forward to the next one
Aug 10 2018,positive,i have enjoyed all the imf movies and that includes this one just a fun movie to see on the big screen
Aug 10 2018,positive,you clearly know what to expect when you watch mission impossible fallout like its predecessor it has all the recurring cast who matter some important returns and great additions to the mi lore the action is real but every scene is a buildup of tension that has not been pulled off like this before having a returning director is a new thing for the longrunning franchise but the results are concrete proof that this sixth installment succeeded in tying it all together
Aug 10 2018,negative,this movie is awful tom cruise does not know how to act the rest of the cast did not know how to help him the writers didnt even try and yet it is getting a 97 on rotten tomatoes its official idiocracry has begun
Aug 10 2018,positive,i loved the movie  the cinematography is excellent and the way the scenes were filmed was amazing  there were moments that made the audience members in my local movie theater make their faces in shock and awe for the things that were actually revealed  cannot wait for them to make another if possible tom cruise is one crazy sob
Aug 10 2018,positive,the best of the series one of the best action movies of recent memory
Aug 10 2018,positive,has the classic mission impossible feel that raises your heart rate while also throwing in different things from the others loved it 
Aug 10 2018,neutral,it was ok a little too long i kept looking at my watch towards the end it was nice to see the familiar faces ving rhames etc the action was good but it just didnt have the panache the other mission impossibles have 
Aug 10 2018,positive,simple stylish and over the top the best one in the series thus far
Aug 10 2018,negative,the best bit deffo the theme tune yes the effects and stunts are clever but the plot is dreadful the characters have no meaning and the dialogue is just rubbish
Aug 10 2018,positive,not only do i think this entry in the mission impossible franchise is the best one yet it might one of the best action thrillers i have ever seen    with amazing stunt work which is tom cruises best work to date and great cinematography this should be seen as an example for how all action films should be made from now on
Aug 10 2018,positive,saw mission impossiblefallout and it was filled with a great cast and better than i anticipated mission impossible is back in full effect worth my 600
Aug 10 2018,positive,extremely satisfying in terms of fastpaced action and character depictions but still an average film in terms of plot and villains  as its predecessors although a big fan of tom cruise i did not expect at all such high rotten tomatoes score for this latest installment of the mission impossible series as i believe that it is indeed an impossible mission to renovate such a formulaic approach to the action genre and deeply traditional action hero like ethan hunt it turned out that i am totally right as the film has a hilariously confusing script full of plotholes and overcomplicated twistandturns that contribute nothing to character development especially of the villains which remain the weakest link in any mission impossible film for example henry cavills character was hyped up as a worthy villain of ethan hunt but his capabilities and behaviors just fluctuated throughout the film to the point that the audience could not decide whether he really is a villain of superior intellectual and physical mights or just a henchman with a mediocre skill set also it is necessary to differentiate this film from an action film with intentionally simple plot in order to solely focus on the actions like mad max fury road since christopher mcquarrie did try to make this film more substantial plotwise with a lengthy subplot about ethan hunts private life which turned out to be too cheesy to be effective several underdeveloped subplots about the apostles and characters like the white widow and one halfhearted utilization of the nuclear fallout motif that is only slightly correct technologywise and mostly useless and illogical also technologywise of course at the end of the day one goes to the watch a mission impossible film not for its plot but for its actions and for the appearance of an ever running ever heroic ethan hunt in that aspect this film is just a perfect choice with nonstop action sequences throughout the film until the very end in exotic and beautiful locations to sum it up this is indeed an excellent action film for this summer but could not be a new benchmark for the action genre as someone might hope after knowing its ridiculously high rotten tomatoes score
Aug 10 2018,positive,standard imf action with tom saving the day glossy and full of stunts date night stuff
Aug 10 2018,positive,stunt after stunt after stunt and something about some nuclear bombs that need finding not a brain teaser but good for a night at the movies good fun but keep calm folks if this is the best action film you have seen its probably the first action film youve ever seen
Aug 10 2018,positive,grabs the audience from beginning to end each scene of action plays into the next with masterful turning of events and ethan hunt and team do it again with a lost cause at the extreme last minute
Aug 10 2018,neutral,i wanted to enjoy this i really did and while there was plenty of action stunts and loving crafting close up shots framing henry cavills incredibly beautiful ass it didnt amount to much it simply whelmed me  i wasnt overwhelmed i wasnt underwhelmed it seemed to drag at times and the pacing was off by quite a bit for me im not angry i saw it it just wasnt what i expected
Aug 10 2018,positive,rollicking adventure best mi ever and even i could follow the plot
Aug 10 2018,positive,the stunts themselves make this movie worth seeing in imax 
Aug 10 2018,positive,best action movie i have ever seen highly recommend it 
Aug 10 2018,positive,you know exactly what to expect going into this movie a polished thrilling action movie with some convoluted spy twists as always it delivers with some new highoctane impressive action set pieces 
Aug 10 2018,positive,best movie of the summer but come on i almost feel bad for the bad guy nothing can kill ethan hunt great action through and through who cares about the plot 
Aug 10 2018,positive,action packed from beginning to end tom cruise and in fact the whole cast were great if the goal of the film was to keep you on the edge of your seatmission accomplished
Aug 10 2018,positive,if you are into mission impossible movies this does the job should you choose to accept it it is full of fast paced action stunning visuals high tech gadgets dark gritty and that twisty plot that keeps you guessing just enough to want the next scene if you arent entertained by this franchise stay home and knit a sweater
Aug 10 2018,positive,although predictable maybe one time watch but worth it
Aug 10 2018,positive,the perfect action film that one summer blockbuster that manages to get you invested in the huge character roster in this big franchise while also doing amazing stunts that instead of just being there to show how capable the cast is genuinely pushes the plot forward and just makes you even more interested which has been a problem with past entries for me doing stunts for the sake of doing it experienced actors like sean harris ving rhames angela bassett and alec baldwin show even more diversity in these roles here with harris being a favorite of mine playing the intimidating endlessly evil solomon lane but every other actor is also very good adding more humanizing qualities to their characters tom cruise and ferguson do an especially good job here although lane is as wicked as ever the other villain lark whose real identity you probably wont be shocked to see manages to be a surprisingly sympathetic villain when you truly understand his motives you might even agree with him somewhat excellent never has an action film had such interesting characters or in general been this good since 2015s mad max fury road go watch this film now
Aug 10 2018,positive,very average there were some cool scenes here and there but overall its nothing you havent seen 100 times before
Aug 10 2018,positive,superb super awesome movie tom cruise is a legendary hero must watch action packed thrilling movie best of all mission impossible every time tom cruise makes an upgrade  peoples movie
Aug 9 2018,positive,best mission impossible movie since the first
Aug 9 2018,positive,one of the rare genre films that gets everything right balls to the wall action and increasingly dense plot lines make this franchise continue to reach new heights
Aug 9 2018,negative,not sure how this got good reviews the only thing good was the action scenes other than that the story and lines was cheesy
Aug 9 2018,positive,plenty of twist turns and tense action scenes that look and feel amazing the mi series keeps getting better and better 
Aug 9 2018,positive,this is the 6th film in a franchise that has been around for 22 years with the same star basically same supporting cast with no reboots and they have delivered their best movie at 56 years old tom cruise may be the best action star in 2018  saying the action sequences in this are phenomenal is understating it there are fight and chase scenes in this that blew me away   sure the story wasnt really anything new but the characters are great and the delivery of some twists as these films will have are well done   this is 2 12 hours and i couldve watched more this has set the bar for any future not just spy but all action movies i will watch this again but in imax and the debacle with the cavill stacheworth it i loved this when i left the theatre and having time to process it i love it more now
Aug 9 2018,positive,amazing movie does everything right a mustsee for movie lovers the action scenes are expertly helmed and the acting is exceptional my only gripe is that the story is a little complicated and its nothing that we havent seen before but its still handled pretty well so its mostly a nitpick  1010
Aug 9 2018,negative,tried way too hard to be like the new james bond series but falls way short tom looks good though
Aug 9 2018,positive,great movie my only issue was that it was a little long but aside from that it was the best mission impossible movie in quite a while
Aug 9 2018,positive,blowing you mind with overthetop action set pieces is what mission impossible does best and continues to do while also throwing in a red ribbon story that demands your attention cruises usual dedicated performance and one of the best handtohand combat scenes of the year
Aug 9 2018,positive,non stop action these movies keep getting better and better
Aug 9 2018,positive,part 2 of rogue rogue being the better and about 15mins too long ilsa should be here to stay lots of exposition about julia thats a bit contrived a good ride but somehow not quite what one might hope  see it in imax for sure even tho most of the picture is liemax letterboxed imax not full screen always feel a bit cheated with that the big set pieces are full imax however maybe 30mins total
Aug 9 2018,positive,was this one of those movies where critics were paid off to post a bunch of awesome reviews  they had my hopes up high  but after seeing the movie the tomato scores dont make sense  relative to other action movies this movie was decent  relative to other mi movies this was probably my least favorite it had several really good action scenes  overall the action was really good  but the plot and story of this one  it was too complicated it was not compelling  i knew from the spoiler start when there wasnt a good opening sequence that something was off  the opening sequence was slow and was just setting up the story  also the cast felt a little tired because the story was lacking  rebecca ferguson was used to great effect in the last mi installment  this story tried to use her in the same way but it was not as interesting repetitive  simon pegg is excellent in everything he does but he and ving rhames are becoming sort of flat characters in the franchise i think new supporting characters would be more interesting  henry cavill was a great casting choice and he was decent character but the story wasnt up to par for his character  and in general the motivations of the antagonists were really hard to relate to  i hope they make more mis but maybe do a bit of a reboot or find a really dynamic and new story
Aug 9 2018,positive,the best action movie ever
Aug 9 2018,positive,amazing actionmovie with incredible stunts
Aug 9 2018,positive,well once that got going it didnt let up 
Aug 9 2018,positive,on par with the standard set by ghost protocol and then boosted by rogue nation  mi just keeps getting better and better  cavill is kinda meh though
Aug 9 2018,positive,i was really looking forward to see it and i am a big fan of mi but left quite disapointed all the jokes all the scenes i saw somewhere before ethan was looking tired everzthing predictable for me  let say 68
Aug 9 2018,positive,really fast paced and entertaining
Aug 9 2018,positive,id like to add a shoutout to the musical score it is outstanding   can this movie be an oscar contender    tom cruise take care of yourself
Aug 9 2018,positive,amazing so awesome funny and entertaining
Aug 9 2018,positive,one of the best action films ever made the cast and stunts are amazing 
Aug 9 2018,positive,one of best action movies of all time
Aug 9 2018,positive,fantastic plot the directors were able to choreograph the scenes and story to a seemless flow great acting and fighting sequences one of my favorite tom cruise movies
Aug 9 2018,positive,this was the first time i have seen a mission impossible movie  i really enjoyed it though  i would like to go back and watch the others now  the story was kind of cheesy at times but the stunts and action way made up for that
Aug 9 2018,positive,what a fantastic film 
Aug 9 2018,positive,just too long i even got to the point that i did not mind if the key character died it became fantastical near the end and just another marvel type just not as good movie skip it unless you like everything tom cruse does
Aug 9 2018,positive,the vast majority of movie franchises suffer from diminishing returns this tom cruiseled action series has avoided that common downturn by turning in ridiculously ambitious consistently fresh and eminently exhilarating thrill rides the sixth mi entry fallout also boasts some firsts first time a director has returned first time the story has been directly influenced by the previous instalment and first time a femme fatale has come back to seduceendanger our protagonist a big part of the franchises success has been the revolving door of directors at the helm each bringing their own visual style and filmmaking priorities so its interesting to see how christopher mcquarrie attacks his second impossible mission behind the camera not surprisingly seeing as mcquarrie has always been a more bluntforce kind of action filmmaker this sequel is arguably the most bruising and intense which is no small feat for a series that has prided itself on its physical demanding set pieces there are no less than four sequences that are genuinely jawdropping in their execution featuring crunching handtohand combat an invigorating carmotorbike pursuit an adrenalinepumping rooftop chase on foot and a ballsy helicoptersplayingchicken sequence beginning with an unbelievable stunt love him or hate him offscreen its getting harder to argue that cruise isnt one of the finest showmen working in hollywood today his dedication to performing some of the craziest stunts committed to celluloid is admirable and quite simply amazing considering his age but it wouldnt be the hugely entertaining film it is if everyone wasnt firing on all cylinders from the pitchperfect supporting cast simon peggs comedic sidekick rebecca fergusons mi6 agent henry cavills undiplomatic cia henchman to the behind the scenes crew in fact composer lorne balfe deserves special mention for his leftoffield score the use of low haunting orchestral tunes including a fantastic rendition of the classic mi theme during select sequences is a masterstroke in imbuing the movie with a certain gravitas with everyone at the top of their game headlined by another fervent cruise performance fallout is extremely highcalibre action cinema that will feature predominantly on endofyear best lists
Aug 9 2018,positive,henry cavil was born for action movies  its really cool movies which i have watched using boxxy software
Aug 8 2018,negative,im probably going against the fandom but i was really bored liked 2 5 1 and 4 better yes the order is ranked by my preference this much like 3 had too many shots of tom cruise senselessly running for my taste
Aug 8 2018,positive,as good as mindless action gets  solid entertainment not pushing anything in the way of ideas though perfect for a summer flic with the kids
Aug 8 2018,positive,wow wow wow non stop action and really good story line love interests and henry cavill they hit the gas and never let up tom cruise is absolutely amazing
Aug 8 2018,positive,typical mission impossible movie but entertaining nonetheless
Aug 8 2018,neutral,just watch it for stunts
Aug 8 2018,positive,i loved it very exciting and fun 
Aug 8 2018,positive,mission impossible lives up to its name tom cruise is that his best high intensity nonstop action thats why i cruise is number one actor in the world in my opinion he is the best actor in the world because of his high intensity and his own stunts and his own right and he just laid back and he just does his thing this film is definitely with all the rest of them they just keep getting better and better donny keegan
Aug 8 2018,positive,pretty much everything is bigger and better this time around including the awesome action set pieces henry cavill plays a good and intimidating bad guy and cruise is always on point and brings his all the last fight with the helicopters got a bit over the top when most of the other action was pretty grounded until that point
Aug 8 2018,positive,awesome movie keeps up the quality from past installments and cruise doesnt stop amazing me with his stunt work 
Aug 8 2018,positive,an overlong but well staged film that alternates between suspenseful action sequences and inane melodrama the dialogue could not be worse but the stunts are great once the action starts takes patience though to stomach all the pork and cheese
Aug 8 2018,positive,i was say a good movie but just missed a great movie this movie is easy to read you know whats going to happen before it does 
Aug 8 2018,positive,the team is looking impossibly old but this movie has a fresher and darker take on the series that breathes fresh life to a franchise with 6 films everything in the movie is impossible but one this that is possible is an exhilarating time beautifully shot and wonderfully acted 
Aug 8 2018,positive,this is the greatest tom cruise movie ive have ever seen in my opinion
Aug 8 2018,positive,the usual action  maybe this time a bit more overboard  almost like a south indian movie action 
Aug 8 2018,negative,the pacing was very bad with the story being very predictable the climactic fight at the end was laughable very slow at times the times that it was fastpaced it was so fastpaced that you couldnt tell what was happening at all
Aug 8 2018,positive,iit was a long movie that didnt feel long great action scenes great summer movie
Aug 8 2018,positive,not the best one for me all seemed a bit too familiar  both the action scenes and the cast i think this one should be tom cruises last  it was low on dialogue and high on action  and  the last scene with the helicopters was particularly farfetched  i also found the whole love triangle thing quite hard to swallow as cruise didnt seem to have much of a real spark for either of them  they kept the action rolling till the end but somehow i couldnt help feeling a bit disappointed  for me mission impossible 5 was much more imaginative and clever
Aug 8 2018,positive,holy heck this movie was a blast from beginning to end it never stops to surprise me and keep me on the edge of my seat i encourage you to see this movie 1110 bs
Aug 8 2018,positive,this was a good movie my problem with these is the length this goes to have action that is unbelievable like wrecking a motorcycle and walking away then wrecking helicopter together you just have to suspend belief 
Aug 8 2018,positive,in a saturated action movie summer mission impossible fallout stands out pure adrenaline car and motorcycle scenes plausible spy plot story great stunts and effects worthy of being part of the mission impossible franchise  story accommodated an aging ethan hunt with the bathroom brawl scene fabulously written and choreographed in a summer filled with superheroes ethan hunt proves they all dont nessecarilly always fly or wear a cape
Aug 8 2018,positive,ethan hunt tom cruise and the rest of his imf team motivated to retrieve 3 hydrogen bombs in which he lost at the opening of the movie he also come across former flames from previous mi movies  this is tom cruises sixth movie with writer director jonathan mcquarrie
Aug 8 2018,negative,so unrealistic and predictable it was almost hard to not get up and leave the theater
Aug 8 2018,negative,lame jokes cheesy dialogue great action scenes
Aug 8 2018,negative,really not impressed and some poor writting and plot
Aug 8 2018,neutral,enjoyed the acting but a very predictable although actionpacked  plot  ending the movie is also missing the spark of humor that ethan hunt has typically added i would have left the movie a cliffhanger leaving the audience wondering what happened to ethan huntnot only would it have provided for some much needed intrigue but would have left the mi franchise somewhat worthy of another film i love a good mi story but  there is  nothing in this film that has me looking forward to another mi film unfortunately if mi writers producers  directors cant do better than this they should just kill off ethan hunt  in an exciting series climax  let the mi franchise die with a shred of dignity    also as an fyi to those who write books or long tomes for reviewsnoone reads them so just stop
Aug 8 2018,positive,exciting escapist fare with the last thirty minutes some of the most exciting in screen history
Aug 8 2018,positive,high action with a hint of humour as you would expect from the mi franchise i dont know why some people seemed to have trouble following the plot as we both found it easy enough  you have to suspend disbelief of course but again thats to be expected all in all rip roaring fun and a must see as its likely to be tom cruises last high action movie if not it should be as hes beginning to show his age in the closeups on extreme screen time to bow out gracefully
Aug 8 2018,negative,curious to what was great about this movie i love watching movies and tjus one was not all what many say it is skyscraper was better than this movie
Aug 8 2018,negative,predictable plot with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese otherwise good  reliable run of the mill visuals on explosions chases and fights
Aug 8 2018,positive,action packed thrillride for sure
Aug 8 2018,positive,slightly overarted great of you main thing are movies with high ten special effects
Aug 8 2018,neutral,its always fun to watch a new mi
Aug 8 2018,negative,tom cruise looks old at 56 years old  the plot is not that great and predictable  henry cavill is the bad guy  he is a cia agent named walker who is also a member of the apostle and he is known as lark  basically cavill wants the 3 plutonium core and to free solomon lane and they hired someone to build a bomb with many failsafes built in  i dont know why the last two mission impossible movie got such high ratings  maybe all the critics are tom cruise fans
Aug 8 2018,positive,love it the best so far
Aug 8 2018,positive,an intense thrill ride typical of the mi franchise filled with drama great action and excitement an enjoyable 212 hours
Aug 8 2018,positive,numbingly sightly and incredible stunning performances by the cast and plot is written in a much complex fashion than regular action movies you get on screen these days
Aug 8 2018,negative,ridiculous boring and cliche  i feel sorry for the actors having to say their linesthe writing is terrible  if you like watching someone else play a video gameyoull like this  i dont
Aug 8 2018,positive,it was a very entertaining movie i wonder if in the next one theyre just going to have tom run the entire time
Aug 8 2018,positive,crazy good action some of these scenes are just unreal the pacing was great as well this was wildly entertaining no matter how many movies preceded it this one is great as well
Aug 8 2018,positive,tons of action i usually boycott tom cruise movies due to his affiliation with scientology but this one is too good 
Aug 8 2018,neutral,i was expecting the best action film ever based on all these rave reviews its basically like the other mission impossible movies 
Aug 8 2018,positive,entertaining good stunts some plot points were predictable 
Aug 8 2018,positive,pretty much a tribute to cruise and the stunts he does or doesnt do and the crazy places they are done the earlier mi movies are a bit wittier and henry cavill is a bore but this one has a great villain sean smith and is still entertaining none the less
Aug 8 2018,positive,another fantastic entry to the best action franchise putting james bond films to shame once again while the beginning is still a little bumpy by the middle of the movie it is developing into a maelstrom of excitement and wonder about how action scenes are thought of directed and performed the paris chase is already pretty fantastic but the last 30 minutes top it all off pushing the envelope with every minute and twist cruise keeps risking his health for his audience i know i am on board perfect action entertainment
Aug 8 2018,positive,like riding a 25 hour roller coaster loved it
Aug 8 2018,positive,simply the best action movie ever made
Aug 7 2018,positive,mi 27 was great haha i honestly cant remember  is this 6 same storyline with mostly the same characters but it still entertained me i cant remember most of what happened in the other films so thats helpful 
Aug 7 2018,positive,well done i enjoyed the movie
Aug 7 2018,positive,ok when you buy a ticket an imf movie you know it comes with masks twists hairs breadth escapes from certain deathand lots of car motorcycle and hey why not helicopter high jinx tooat city a minute pace it plum wore me out which translates as the thing was way too long as the plot such as it was unfolded i began wishing id had a cast of characters to refer toparticularly since the franchise seems to believe that youve seen every iteration and are familiar with the goodly number of veterans who show up again so the plot was thin most characters were cardboard cutouts it was too long etcbut there were some stunts and action scenes the like of which ive never seen tom you are the man
Aug 7 2018,positive,action adventure locations mi6 has the formula down to an art form as good if not better than its 2 predecessors it delivers for the faithful already looking forward to mi7
Aug 7 2018,positive,a great movie to watch full of action and suspense 
Aug 7 2018,positive,best movie of the year great characters great story
Aug 7 2018,positive,really good movie the action is well done and they always seem to add something new and crazy however how many times can they accuse hunt of being the bad guy 4 out of 6 mi movies have him as the supposed bad guy my only real gripe about the movie extremely well done
Aug 7 2018,positive,the only thing keeping me from going for the full 5 stars is a clichéd plot admittedly though with some fun twists even with that this film is filled with some of the best action sequences in the franchise appreciate tom cruise while hes still able to do stuff like this
Aug 7 2018,positive,a great action flic one of the best ive ever seen great scenes which shows why tom cruise gets the big bucks best mission impossible movie hands down
Aug 7 2018,negative,a collection of stunts with an incomprehensible plot that serves as nothing more than the excuse for the next stunt  i generally find that some kind of plausibility makes a movie more interesting  this movie is never believable  not for one second  its all a cartoon and everyone is fake  but theres a lot of stunts  no doubt about that
Aug 7 2018,positive,hugely entertaining
Aug 7 2018,positive,genuinely entertained again tom cruise delivers yet another thrill ride hats off to the entire cast and crew on this missionhow they do that was the reoccurring phrase that came out my mouth 
Aug 7 2018,positive,ill never forget how truly shook i was during this movie
Aug 7 2018,positive,if you didnt like thiskill yourselffr
Aug 7 2018,negative,horrible way too long and should have edited out some of the sappy dialogue and the twenty million knife fights
Aug 7 2018,positive,worst offering of the series  i enjoyed the previous chapters but this one was just even more preposterous  bigger problem was strained acting from main leads  didnt buy the tortured ethans  broken love life at all  action scenes were over the top as expected
Aug 7 2018,positive,this movie was great  henry cavill was well surprising to say the least still loved rogue nation more but a helluva film nonetheless
Aug 7 2018,positive,loved the action well done whats this thing with the stunts from heights though as someone with acrophobia its hard to watch at times not one stunt but several  from tall building to tall towers to cliffs and helicopters and aircraft  ok tom we get it youre an action hero and you do the stunts life no cg but really every movie you jump from great heights glad its you and not me buddy
Aug 7 2018,negative,this movie is the reason that i or any member of my family never go to a movie theather again in the future this is the worst and ridiculous movies ever made lost of time and money
Aug 7 2018,positive,best mission impossible movie to date and best action movie of the year
Aug 7 2018,positive,an impossible plot certainly and cruise is aware enough to gently mock his age in the early sections theres something a bit hohum in this overlong outing how many times can tom throw himself out of planes or leap across rooftops before you stifle a yawn its not awful its just meh actually im wrong henry cavill is awful
Aug 7 2018,negative,all mindless action almost no story
Aug 7 2018,positive,tom cruise made it worth every second  you will catch yourself holding your breath in every action scene 
Aug 7 2018,negative,weak script awful dialogues logical holes of incredible diameter tons of pathos and cruise flattery visual effects are not so good to compensate that shocked to see such rating on rt
Aug 7 2018,positive,exactly what its meant to be  perfectly paced edge of your seat fun
Aug 7 2018,positive,while it works at a grounded more personal level compared to its predecessors the action and muscle are still cranked up to 11 in another fantastically entertaining entry in the mi franchise
Aug 7 2018,negative,saw the great reviews and went to watch i am not a fan of mindless action movies and cannot overlook a poor and ridiculous plot yes some fun and exciting action sequences but this movie seems to think it can distract audiences with a fast pace and treating tom cruise as a video game hero dialogue was also contrived i simply did not care who lived or died expected with this budget more than cartoon like moving from chase to chase
Aug 7 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is directed once again by christopher mcquarrie the director of mission impossible  rogue nation written by christopher mcquarrie and bruce geller and starring tom cruise henry cavill and rebecca ferguson with tons of other great cast    the best intentions often come back to haunt you mission impossible  fallout finds ethan hunt tom cruise and his imf team alec baldwin simon pegg ving rhames along with some familiar allies rebecca ferguson michelle monaghan in a race against time after a mission gone wrong henry cavill angela bassett and vanessa kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker christopher mcquarrie returning to the helm    i really loved mission impossible  fallout i missed these breathtaking action scenes this year but finally i found what ive been looking for for very so long and thanks goes to mission impossible  fallout    everything in this movie was completely amazing except for a small leak and it is the script as i said its not big its just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan    lets get started with the only thing i didnt like about this movie and as i said its the script okay why every thing they are about to do or planned to do or anything to do they just have to say ill figure it out or im working on it what didnt you plan for anything for this movie or something  these two sentences bothered the hell out of me actually but its nothing compared to everything that i loved in this movie    first of all the action sequence its one of the best action movie of all the time every action scene i was like omg thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action thank you i think its the best action movie in 2018 so far    quickly quickly lets move to the performances i loved them all what an actconvincing i have no other comment about the acting cause it was quite perfect    oh were not done yet we still have the fascinating storytelling i dont want to spoil anything but i need to say that dont believe what youre watching cause they will surprise you like hell  the story was good in every way that it could be maybe at the beginning it didnt get my attention but then it got my whole attention    believe me no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece and if you dont believe us go and see it yourself it will not let you down never ever    i actually wasnt excited to watch this movie the trailer didnt get me at all but it did actually give me what i want it was way better than i expected its gonna be    oh one more sadly thing i just remembered that i didnt like the ost wasnt that good as it was so usual but it wasnt so bad    im gonna give mission impossible  fallout an a i think its a magnificent movie and definitely a worthwatching movie i highly recommend watching this movie guys    okay guys thank you as always for reading my review hope you like and if you have any comment please say it to get improved
Aug 7 2018,positive,fun with a great cast this may be the second best film in an inconsistent series still there was more potential than was realized this film leaned heavily on its action sequences cast and prior story lines for its appeal with a script most people could have predicted before walking into the theater
Aug 7 2018,negative,filled with cliches and bad acting if youre into that
Aug 7 2018,positive,astonishing action movie fantastis stunts great actors and a good story
Aug 7 2018,positive,a somewhat frivolous plot cant dampen the exhilaration of the jawdropping set pieces  the chase through the streets of paris is on par with the famous car scene in the french connection as far as sheer momentum is concerned
Aug 7 2018,positive,enjoyed a lot  going a second time
Aug 7 2018,positive,awesome plot twist everyone is double crossing awesome performance by tom cruise and directed all together
Aug 7 2018,positive,it was a really good action movie but predictable all the way through with the exception of one surprise reappearance i would recommend this movie as a good decent summer movie for date night
Aug 7 2018,positive,not a big cruise fan but i really liked it
Aug 7 2018,positive,amazing movie dont miss
Aug 7 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is amazing quite possibly the best instalment in the franchise a must see for all action fans i loved it a lot of twists and turns as you would come to expect for im films   mi fallout feels like christopher nolan film christopher macquarie does an amazing job at replicating nolans style there are points in this movie where you would be surprised that you arent watching a chris nolan film    mi feels pretty oldfashioned lots of practical effects and sparing usage of cgi the score also feels oldfashioned and gives us probably the best use of the mission impossible theme ever   mission impossible fallout utilizes many locations around the world it makes great use of its locations all of which have a unique job in the story and unique set pieces    and these locations are astoundingly shown in imax cinematography this is a must see in imax this movie is made to be seen in imax if you cant make it to an imax get to the biggest screen you can the best experience for this film is in imax    tom cruise dedication to realism set this movie and all the mission impossible movies miles apart from other action films tom cruise learnt to fly a helicopter in six weeks for this film and not only did he had to fly the helicopter but he also had to act and even operate the cameras as nobody else could be seen in the helicopter tom cruise looked oddly older than any of his films but this allowed for a more mature performance from cruise   henry cavill is amazing i believe that this is the best role to date though the film unfortunately doesnt utilize him to his fullest   simon pegg feels more like a real hollywood actor than he had before he was more in control of his character and in the other films he had an omg i can believe im this movie feel to his performance which he seemed to have lost in this film which is great    you may want to watch the previous film is you havent already as there are lots of links to rogue nation other than that you dont really need to have seen the other films
Aug 7 2018,positive,a fine addition to the franchise providing laughs gasps and cheers the best part has to be the fight scenes though especially the bathroom one i recommend seeing this movie albeit it can be slow at times otherwise great cast and movie
Aug 7 2018,positive,another stellar mi movie actionpacked and adrenaline pumping throughout ill watch these as long as they stay entertaininggeriatric tom cruise racing a wheelchair over a curb could still be exciting given the usual twists and turns these movies provide
Aug 7 2018,positive,best one yet bad robot record continues 
Aug 7 2018,positive,absolutely top notch amazing pace solid characters a handsome guy as the bad dude really enjoyable some good banter massive stunts exactly what you want from action movie
Aug 7 2018,positive,likely one of the best actions movies evwr made 
Aug 7 2018,positive,awesome tom is a beast 
Aug 7 2018,positive,the mission impossible movies are very consistent and very good tom cruise does a great job as hunt and it is obvious that he does many of his own stunts the movie has tons of action and twists and turns it is a fun movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat in the end the movie ends like you would expect and youll be cheering how it ends another fun summer movie
Aug 7 2018,positive,most of the time i knew what would happen but it was still great watching it happen
Aug 7 2018,positive,pure filmmaking magic and extremely entertaining its flaws are nothing compared to the joy i felt watching it
Aug 7 2018,positive,amazing movie from start to finish no down time at all 
Aug 7 2018,positive,the best mission impossible yet
Aug 7 2018,positive,its pretty good but the third act is kind of disappointing compared to the first and second acts
Aug 7 2018,positive,always great movies with garrett action and a gripping story that keeps you on the edge of your seat cavil was amazing in the role and id definitely recommend this movie to anyone in need of an action packed blockbuster
Aug 6 2018,positive,just another quality action movie but i feel like action movies are taking the same path as animated films in that there are too many extraordinary smartoriginal movies that one like fallout just doesnt blow you away  some decent chases cool helicopter crash scene but also the typical action stuff carmotorcycle chases bomb that will detonate double crossing partner dangling from things etc  alright enjoyment
Aug 6 2018,positive,i liked it better than rogue nation but thought ghost protocol was better  some great action sequences
Aug 6 2018,negative,yup cheesy dialog and not entertaining 
Aug 6 2018,positive,good film same story but the action is present is so cool
Aug 6 2018,positive,good movie intense action packed with a few surprises
Aug 6 2018,positive,nonstop action typical mi movie
Aug 6 2018,negative,repetitive pointless action filmed solely for entertainment while forgetting to have an actual coherent plot every scene happened just to happen ethan hunts ego is too big and they over do the whole hes clearly the best guy on earth wow so wholesome so good so moral the bad guy could not have been more obvious since they give it away wayyyyy too early in the movie the white widow acted clueless dumb and was overall just another pretty face to look at every action scene was beautifully choreographed and wonderfully filmed but was so impractical and littered with so many glaring flaws it took away from how cool it was supposed to be i could go on for hours
Aug 6 2018,positive,as an avid fan of the mission impossible movies i was a bit concerned about fallout because there are two great things that set this franchise apart from all the others and they ignored both this time first of all they have done a good job of hiring a different director for every single film which means they each have their own unique feel this movie was carrying over christopher mcquarrie to take a second consecutive shot at directing i didnt have any issues with his direction of rogue nation but i liked the variety they attained before secondly all the films up to this point have been almost complete standalone stories there were a few minor references to the past but nothing that made it necessary to know the history to enjoy the next movie fallout is the first that directly ties into the previous films and references them a number of times in fact you could almost find direct connections to all 5 previous installments in this one im not sure if any of this made it hard for those who arent fans of the franchise to follow this plot but i found myself lapping it up it felt standalone but also connected which is hard to pull off at this point it seems like they need to reference the history anyways because tom cruise is starting to get older despite how it may appear on screen this is the first time i felt they played into cruises age just a little bit he actually looks worn weary and fallible at certain times this doesnt mean he isnt kicking butt and performing some of the most insane deathdefying stunts you can imagine because theres still plenty of that the stunt coordinators on these films continue to astound me as they make the action feel authentic instead of something manufactured in a machine the bar is continually set by practical stunts and computer animation still hasnt caught up thats what makes mission impossible the gold standard when it comes to action the story here is a little convoluted but considering the amount of doublecrossing and mistaken identity that happens in these films it is par for the course i did find myself predicting some of the twists and turns only because ive trained myself to expect some level of deception at any moment the way they build tension into the story is perfect and even when i mentally know the hero cant possibly die in an early scene i still feel some level of concern that the movie might surprise me the cast is all great in fallout including the newcomer henry cavill im such an avid fan of this franchise that i wish they would start grooming the next generation star who has an insane taste for risking hisher life to replace tom cruise well see if it ever gets to that point but for now im still enjoying the adventures and im astounded that at this point it seems mission impossible has found a way to completely steal the spy film spotlight from james bond
Aug 6 2018,positive,the greatest action movie ive ever seen unbelievable
Aug 6 2018,positive,lots of action nonstop fun
Aug 6 2018,positive,movie was really good hennery cavil played his part so well movie is definitely worth watching if you your like a hard hitting action movie
Aug 6 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout the 6th movie of the ongoing movie series is a great example of what an action movie should be tom cruise once again impresses fans across the globe by doing every stunt by himself without the help of a stunt double other cast members such as simon pegg rebecca ferguson ving rhames sean harris and alec baldwin are very good at playing their roles aswell for me personally i find this film the absolute best of the famous mi collection the action never slows down and speaking of action  that bathroom fight scene was epic in so many ways props to the directorwhoever helped to make fallout because i have now declared it to be my favourite movie of 2018 so far with avengers infinity war being second cant wait to see whats planned for the future
Aug 6 2018,positive,another great action movie addition to the series one of my favorite movie series is this series
Aug 6 2018,neutral,have the movie people paid off the guys at rotten tomatoes   its star wars all over again    very predictable actually boring    acting was poor all round     seemed rushed through somehow    worst one ive seen hands down    not as bad as star wars reharshed rubbish   very poor wish i hadnt gone to cinema to see it  could have waited for dvd     why did it get that rating    so seriously this movie stands up to the likes of usual suspects  jason bourne etc   no   first jack reacher movie is better
Aug 6 2018,positive,overall enjoyable movie with a decent story massive respect to tom cruise for the stunts he performed
Aug 6 2018,positive,honestly may be the best action film i have ever seen great acting stunts and special effects are amazing even the story is really good looking for a great action film that will roll you entertained for 2hrs 20 mins  then this is it
Aug 6 2018,positive,impossible not as good as everyone seems to think
Aug 6 2018,positive,great action cinematography and sound effects however the story and acting felt quite weak in my opinion
Aug 6 2018,negative,horrible just plain horrible in an age where spy movies and hero movies are consistently coming out and blowing away previous films fallout was a snoozefest the plot  if it can be called that  is so weak and tiresome that within the first ten minutes anyone with a brain can determine how it will end i know tom cruise supposedly did his own stunts but the how and why arent actually feasible in real life i know i know its not supposed to be real but some semblance of plausibility would have been nice dont waste your money wait til it comes out in dvd or on a streaming site just not worth it
Aug 6 2018,positive,this movie was one of the finest action movies i have ever seen its that simple being a fan of action films such as the bourne series the bond series and especially the mission series this film holds up as one of the best tom cruise is simply on another level with work ethic that you do not see anymore he learned to fly a freaking helicopter for a chase sequence he jumped out of a plane at 25000 feet and also broke his ankle performing a jump he is nuts the film if you follow the series picks up as a continuation of the 5th film as most of the characters return with the exception of renner the plot was deep felt no matter how silly some of the sequences got we really see some tight relationships on the screen that does had some heart to the film the film never ever let up and had sequences that rank up there with the dubai scene i also want to say henry cavill exceeded expectations here he was fantastic and very believable he also kicked major tail this movie is the ultimate popcorn fun with an edge to it its what michael bay wishes he could be at the end of the day cruise is what ties the film together his bold presence his stunt work and dedication to the role puts the bow on the box a near perfect action film that could be one of the genres best in some time
Aug 6 2018,positive,deliriously entertaining set pieces meet taut and subtle smaller exchanges  cram it all together and you get perhaps the most technically well crafted action thriller since mad max fury road   mi fallout proves that the series is as strong as ever
Aug 6 2018,neutral,lots of action although it tests the limits of believability great stunts but the plot twists were very predictable and the dialogue is lacking the male costar henry cahill is awful his lines are completely stiff and have seen better acting in community theater fun movie but i wouldnt pay full price to see it
Aug 6 2018,positive,equal parts ridiculous and thrilling the sixth mission impossible movie is definitely full of cliches but puts them to the best use ive seen in a spyaction movie since well the last mission impossible movie
Aug 6 2018,positive,it looks and sounds pretty good  the stunts are impressive  see it for the stunts
Aug 6 2018,positive,typical but entertaining as usual
Aug 6 2018,positive,what an incredible movie from start to finish cant recommend it enough
Aug 6 2018,positive,best movie of the franchise i thought id never watch one to beat the first one it felt like an all time classic almost had that atmosphere of the dark knight of christopher nolan down to earth but impossible enough to have its jawdropping moments  please dont let this franchise die as long as tom cruise keep up reliving this level of entertainment
Aug 6 2018,positive,mission impossiblefallout conteins the best cinematogrphy of the saga and most of the time an exellent production design envolving whit a remarkable and nostalghic actuations and an exellent but no perfect thrilling history the movie feels like an atmospheric action pack
Aug 6 2018,negative,how do we get into this club that hosts thousands of people we better jump out of an airplane and land on the roof
Aug 6 2018,positive,never mind the story the set prices are out of this world the action was almost james cameronian
Aug 6 2018,positive,plot seemed forced humor seemed untimely and forced while you know youll get some level of impossible moments many here seemed too far fetched liked the action didnt love the movie 
Aug 6 2018,positive,fast tense and absurd throughout missionimpossiblefallout is action packed with scenes that wow and others that make you squirm worth the time and one of the better in the franchise 710 tomcruise 
Aug 6 2018,positive,got bit lost at times early on but caught up fantastic helicopter action seen
Aug 6 2018,positive,everything is near perfect in this movie action story the usuals direction bgm sound and the action sequences spot on
Aug 6 2018,positive,if youve seen the previous mi movies this one is no different though the plot could have been better overall still a good action movie
Aug 6 2018,negative,an incredible 20 minutes of action surrounded by 2 hours of crap  still glad i saw it but more for rubbernecking than anything else  also pretty much everyone else is wasted in this movie except for tc who sucks all the air out of every scene
Aug 6 2018,positive,tom cruise is a legend scientology god
Aug 6 2018,positive,sure there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck thru an overuse of printing a face to impersonate someone unbelieveable situations that have no credible setup and an ending that ran about 15 minutes too long  but damn this was one helluva a good time and a great follow up to rogue nation  props to cruise on doing his own stunts that engages you even more in every action sequence  well worth the time and  invested in going to the theater
Aug 6 2018,negative,2 15 hrs of action packed crap with cheap cheap cheap plot twists poor character development and horrible attempts at humor i am guessing christopher mcquarrie and tom cruise are trying to milk this mission impossible thing for all its worth you can tell they are desperate for content save your money and go see something less vapid
Aug 6 2018,positive,best one of the series
Aug 6 2018,positive,great action movie plot fairly tight easy to follow became a bit unbelievable with the helicopter crash scenes but overall a lot of fun
Aug 6 2018,negative,acting was subpar baldwin and cruise sounded flat  as though they were reading a teleprompter half the time  writing was trite   terrible laughed through half this movie and yes cruise runs again this time at about a cgenhanced warp speed
Aug 6 2018,positive,this or rogue nation i cant decide which i like better oh darn guess i have to watch them again this may just be the finest mission yet
Aug 6 2018,positive,a unoriginal plot is spiced up by fun and energetic action sequences the acting is top notch and tom cruise is again superb as ethan hunt worth seeing this one in theaters just for the car chase in paris
Aug 6 2018,negative,the usual way too long much ado about very little the helicopter battle scenes were cool but wish they had gotten to that much sooner if you go skip the 3d
Aug 6 2018,positive,wew awesome cinematography fight scenes were epic
Aug 6 2018,neutral,pretty mediocre script for such a talented team unfortunately nothing new
Aug 6 2018,positive,good action scenes but cheesy and predictable no idea how the ratings are so high 
Aug 6 2018,positive,great movie pretty long movie but i knew what i was getting into before i watched it definitely worth it
Aug 6 2018,positive,tom cruise is back live action
Aug 6 2018,positive,full spoilerfree review    rating a    mission impossible  fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of alltime regarding the execution of said action set pieces tom cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history through dozens of runs jumps and god knows what more mcquarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters a simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action and it still carries a few predictable twists only a few nitpicky things forbid me from giving this film an a but i promise you it will definitely be in my top10 by the end of the year go see it on imax now
Aug 6 2018,positive,every thing about this movie is brilliant absolutely beautiful brilliant take a half star off because its cliche spy movie storyline 
Aug 6 2018,positive,an action roller coaster better put your seatbelt on for this one
Aug 6 2018,positive,mission impossible did the impossible with one of the best films of the franchise in typical mi fashion the plot guides you in one direction then hits you with a hard turn the adventure is complemented with corny jokes provided by cruise and pegg for what few shortcomings the movie did have the cinematography was enough to distract you not a movie that required you to watch the 5 prequels so my suggestions is to take the time and see it on the big screen
Aug 6 2018,positive,the mission impossible movies are getting better with each instalment totally bucking the usual trend for sequels thanks goodness loved this film and totally recommend it to anyone who liked the previous mis
Aug 6 2018,positive,my hands were sweating the whole time what a great movie 
Aug 6 2018,positive,without doubt the best in the franchise fallout continues to top the mi franchise with breathtaking settings and seat gripping stunt work by stunt man tom cruise
Aug 6 2018,positive,not a fan of spy movies and normally mi movies make me rethink that this one has changed my mind from beginning to end this movie was amazing and exactly what an action movie should be
Aug 6 2018,positive,the best mission impossible ive seen great action from beginning to end
Aug 6 2018,positive,brilliant performance by tom cruise and the cast the stunts and impossible scenes kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie nerve racking in the best way possible
Aug 6 2018,positive,favorite mi yet fantastic action story and characters i was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie
Aug 6 2018,positive,not quite as good as rogue nation but definitely my second favorite of the mi series wonderful cast with jawdropping action best film this summer and a breather from all those superhero films nice to see a movie not bombarded by so much cgi
Aug 6 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is directed by christopher mcquarrie who previously directed rogue nation this is the first instalment of the franchise in which a director has returned and it has proved to be an excellent decision  mcquarrie has taken everything that has worked within the series as he did in rogue nation and escalated it the stunning action set pieces the series has become known for are combined with refined emotional stakes in fallout mcquarrie is clearly aware that intense action is not intense without the audience being emotionally invested in the characters     the stakes in fallout are ridiculously high involving a nuclear threat which we as audience members have become accustomed to yet mcquarrie keeps the story rooted within character bringing the film above other generic action films with end of the world scenarios sean harriss brilliantly menacing solomon lane makes the threat personal to tom cruises ethan hunt this personal element is escalated with the return of michelle monaghan reprising her role from jj abramss mission impossible 3 who is at the heart of the story from the very opening shot mcquarrie has created the most emotionally intense film of the series by developing its characters before placing them within the action rebecca ferguson returning as isla faust from rogue nation is given a rivetingly unpredictable role simon pegg and ving rhames also reprise their roles although underused rhames has a surprisingly emotional dialogue scene increasing the tension in proceeding action scenes involving his character the film is set up unpredictably in a way which means you actually feel the characters are at real risk and of course tom cruise gives a fittingly vulnerable strong performance as ethan hunt especially in scenes involving monaghans character and in interactions with sean harris as lane and of course within the thrilling action sequences he is at the centre of    the jawdropping action sequences are made jawdropping due to their practicality cruise has shockingly topped the c17 stunt in rogue nation with a terrifyingly brilliant helicopter sequence filmed using imax cameras performed for real in typical tom cruise fashion the paris motorcycle sequence is so intense it is difficult to watch yet you wont be able to take your eyes of the screen what makes these action scenes is that the stunts are combined with perfect camerawork mcquarrie is not attempting to imitate the fitting shakiness of bourne as jj abrams tried unsuccessfully in mission impossible 3 he is doing the opposite the camera is placed within the action and showcases the stunts in all their glory following objectscharacters or even being attached to them there is a standout action sequence in a bathroom which is far more grounded than larger scaled stunts within the film yet it is made just as intense maybe more so through stunning choreography and the casting of liang yang his menacing facial expressions alone elevate the intensity of the sequence unusual for handtohand combat film sequences you feel the impacts of every punch this feeling of impact is obviously brought out through the choreography but is also heightened with sound design every punch is brutally heard every gunshot is joltingly loud in contrast mcquarrie has also used silence in moments of action most notably as a result of a lightning strike during the nailbiting halo jump sequence and in a brilliant onetake shootout sequence in order to give it the surreal feeling it required     furthermore there are quieter scenes of tension throughout created by performances and writing the writing is often predictable and is no usual suspects also written by christopher mcquarrie yet it is often very good in terms of creating tension a scene which stood out for me was one involving a french policewoman for its tension humour is also cleverly balanced with tension and darkness especially evident in this scene  a scene of initial humour which unfolds into extreme tension and weightiness     in conclusion fallout is the best entry in the series yet with its culmination of incredible stunt work performances and a personal story to the characters which serves to heighten the intensity
Aug 6 2018,positive,intense and nonstop action movie cruise delivered another great movie really enjoyed it
Aug 5 2018,positive,great action keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you guessing till the end
Aug 5 2018,positive,another thrilling mission impossible that delivers what it promises a rollercoaster of action and suspence
Aug 5 2018,neutral,plotless pointless and sexist creating a relevant and progressive action film certainly must be the mission impossible for this franchise in the world of mi  only ethan hunt can save the world in that  i have a gut feeling machismo unsurprisingly it fails the bechdel test and worse all of the female characters are either a love interest a damsel in distress  incompetent evil or selfish beautiful glimpses of the landscapes are enjoyable but not enough to see past the explicit garbage its not bad but its not good and would score around 75
Aug 5 2018,negative,this was a terrible movie i went to see it hoping for a better plot story characters and action there was action but action without raison detre is empty there were many paris chase scenes perhaps emulating frankenheimers ronin yet they did not work because the movie is so flawed that even a good car chase seems meaningless a character can have a rifle when it is not needed and not have one when it is the whole creaky house of cards does not make sense do not waste your time
Aug 5 2018,positive,awesome acting and plot twist that keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie 
Aug 5 2018,positive,this is the best action movie since mad max fury road real stunts really do make for a better movie then cgi also the movies plot it a bit overly complicated but the amount of double crosses was insane enough for it to be almost genius
Aug 5 2018,positive,action sequences were cool for the most part acting was okay nothing out of this world but thats expected with these types of movies pretty long overall im on the fence if its worth seeing in theaters though 
Aug 5 2018,positive,there are films that come with a lot of positive buzz and anticipation as the release date looms the anticipation builds up to the point where its too high to ever be met and you cant help but be a tiny bit disappointed when finally viewing it it takes some time pondering and a good step back to see its full beauty for me in the last few years only two highly anticipated films have not fallen victim to this phenomenon impressing from the opening credits to the end credits pulverising expectations and snatching breath away before one can gasp the first was blade runner 2049 and the second is mission impossible fallout     never has a modern action film let alone a sequel in an inconsistent franchise confounded my expectations and defied the limits of what an action film can achieve its incredible thrilling chilling and gorgeous to look at from the shadowy and clandestine opening that recalls the coldwar shadowplay of the original the slick extended shots of action sequences and dialogue and stunning action beats to quieter moments where we get to pause for a half breath and soak in the beauty of the many locations they shot in to the final much lauded helicopter sequence this is a movie that just keeps on giving from halo jumps to bruising fist fights to bike chases car chases foot chases shoot outs and finally dangling below a helicopter before climbing up inside it for real too to chase a second helicopter through snow capped mountain ranges new zealand doubling as kashmir and thats just the action     it also contains some of the most layered characterisation of any mi film a coherent plot and chilling villians not to mention the female representation mi has ironically managed to do over the last 4 films what bond has not been able to do over 24 films create strong independent woman with their own motivations and convictions capable and self reliant for the most part while still managing to knock em dead in a evening gown when required they threaten to steal the show as does henry cavill in his hulking intimidating and unstoppable yet still charming form it manages to pay homage to the best parts of the previous entires even better than rogue nation did and land the 3rd act better than rogue nation did too while loosing the cutesy tone of the previous two for a grittier more grounded approach with real stakes this time reverting to 35mm as a shooting format is also a welcome return rendering a beautifully filmic image that appears natural yet embellishing in all the right places     i struggled to like rogue nation as much as i wanted to the tone was something i couldnt reconcile and the action wasnt as polished and well staged as id hoped and the film lost its motivation somewhere after the final bike chase fallout rectifies this and then some its not only the best mi to date its potentially the best action blockbuster ever and thats saying something the real impossible mission should they choose to accept sorry will be topping this with the next entry good luck though highest recommendation
Aug 5 2018,positive,this movie is epic this is the action movie of the year this is one of tom cruise best movie yet
Aug 5 2018,positive,meh decent not great not sure what the hype is about 
Aug 5 2018,positive,the best movie yet i wouldnt normally say that about a sequel movie in this case multiple but this was great with action and plot the entire time
Aug 5 2018,positive,the script was poor you could tell they did not spend much time or thought into it seems they had a deadline and it showed the movie was very predictable it had rambo type of unbelievable unrealistic things happening throughout the movie for instance tom cruise was chasing the bad guy and was running full speed then suddenly he is on the ground running full speed how did he get there no way but i gave the movie three stars aand a half as it was entertaining and fun and i can look past the unbelievable as i like these types of movies good to get out of the real world and just watch a fun crazy adventure look forward to tom cruises next film as it brings the excitement 
Aug 5 2018,positive,holy cow  i didnt think it would be possible for the franchise to top rogue nation and this film comes so very very close on so many levels  the thrills are most definitely edgeofyourseat in a film that manages to have both good character development as well as some of the best action pieces youll see all year      the mission impossible franchise has officially outbonded the james bond series
Aug 5 2018,positive,ethan hunt at it again  must see
Aug 5 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is a fun action movie with a compelling story that is captivating to follow this spy film has a great cast and feels very intense due to tom cruise doing his own stunts the only flaw with this film is that the villain was a little predictable and the ending can be seen coming this impossible mission is a great instalment to the franchise
Aug 5 2018,neutral,typical mi movie not worthy of the current rating
Aug 5 2018,positive,one of the greatest action films ive seen in quite some time pitch perfect go watch it
Aug 5 2018,positive,well i must admit that this franchise is one that i can watch over and over again and never tire with it the opening scenes are always gripping and when the theme tune starts the audience knows its in for a roller coaster of a film fallout is a continuation of this ethan hunt and his crew are out to save their reputation and put away the leader of the syndicate now the apostles from word go we are treated to action action and action this has been my film of the year cant wait for it to come out on dvd
Aug 5 2018,positive,if you liked the previous mis you will like this
Aug 5 2018,positive,great action movie
Aug 5 2018,positive,i really loved just about everything about this movie cruise plays himself 20 years younger than his actual age he does all or most of the stunts himself and the studio lets him despite the insurance costs a week on most of what i remember is the trechery and distrust in the middle and then the crazy helicopter chase at the end it was touching too to see his relationship with his former wife who left him for her own safety the special effects were on a different level to most movies although perhaps not as good as max max fury road  i strongly recommend this a move the only action movie i have seen thats better is perhaps the 1st incredibles nothing quite like it movie and black panther a song for the continent of africa
Aug 5 2018,negative,i have loved every single mission impossible movie this was the 2nd time in my life i fell asleep in a movie and i wish my wife would have let me sleep through it the action was good and even though i know they had to tell a story it felt like it could have been accomplished in 45 less minutes i am not sure if the movie was less entertaining because of the fact tom cruise is getting older and not able to do as much or the fact he broke his leg during filming the 7 previews before the movie also didnt help i can say i walked away dissatisfied and wish i would have watched something else 
Aug 5 2018,positive,as the first director to return to a mission impossible movie christopher mcquarrie not only accomplishes in topping his previous movie but he easily delivers the best representation of both what the show was as well as satisfying those who have been on board with this series since the third movie one of the best action movies youll see in a while
Aug 5 2018,positive,coming down from the surging adrenaline rush i was trying to determine when was the last time an action movie made me feel the immersive delirious highs that mission impossible  fallout offers in spades and what i came up with 2015s mad max fury road simply put this is the best straightforward action movie in three years its the best mission impossible movie in the series which if it hadnt already has assumed the peak position of the most consistent most entertaining and best action franchise in hollywood allow me to explain how returning writerdirector christopher mcquarrie jack reacher makes an action movie that demolishes the competition    ethan hunt tom cruise has been pulled back into spy action thanks to the lingering fallout eh eh of the capture of solomon lane sean harris whose followers nicknamed the apostles have stolen three plutonium cores its ethan hunts fault the nuclear cores got loose and so he and his team luther ving rhames and benji simon pegg must clean up after their mess the cia sends its own asset the burly august walker henry cavill to help oversee the mission and specifically ethan hunt who must pose as a shadowy terrorist broker to maintain appearances with important figures in the criminal underworld in order to get the nuclear parts ethan hunt has to retrieve solomon lane and release him back into the open complicating matters further is ilsa faust rebecca ferguson who needs solomon dead to clear her own spy debts    every action movie lives or dies depending upon its unique set pieces often the first thing constructed by a studio and then the plot mechanics are ladled on merely as the barest of connecting tissue they need to have stakes they need to have purpose they need to be memorable and they need to be understood and develop organically mission impossible  fallout could be taught in filmmaking schools about how to properly build action set pieces they are brilliant mcquarrie finds interesting ways to set them up complicate them and just keep the escalation going in a manner that still maintains the believability of the moment take for instance a foot chase where ethan hunt is trying to nab a bad guy through downtown london where mcquarrie pushes into the extraordinary is by having that foot chase on a multilevel terrain ethan hunt has to chase after his target but multiple stories above the ground and so hes leaping out windows jumping over rooftops simply to keep up its a simple twist that takes what were familiar with and literally elevates it to new heights or take for instance the mission in paris to capture solomon lane at first its capture then its flee police then its flee another assassin there are multiple stages to this sequence each with a new goal each with new complications and each with new eyepopping stunts and escapes the action finds natural points to progress making smart use of the geography and keeping different elements at play to come in and out to add more problems this is how you do action right as soon as the halfhour mark settles in with the arrival of walker the movie is practically nonstop in its set pieces until the very end at a steep 147 minutes this is the longest mission impossible movie yet but its breathless in its execution    amazing set pieces that are cleverly designed is one aspect of a great action movie but if you cant tell whats going on whats the point of all that cleverness fortunately mcquarrie understands this and adheres to a visceral depiction of the action that creates gloriously immersive and pulsepounding sequences the set pieces are terrific so it stands to reason the stuntwork should be terrific and to make sure you appreciate the stuntwork mcquarrie makes sure the photography highlights the verisimilitude its a symbiotic or as the venom trailer tells me symbioatic relationship but when done correctly as evidenced in this film its the key to truly kinetic action sequences take for instance a parachute jump that marks the start of the second act mcquarrie films it as a sustained long take and as the camera plummets to the ground chasing after the two men our brains can tell us that there is some special effects trickery to mitigate the dangers but our senses are overwhelmed with the sustained illusion of tension the fight choreography is equally up to the challenge a bathroom brawl with ethan hunt and walker and another man becomes a lesson in how many things can be smashed and what can be used as a weapon a highspeed motorcycle chase through parisian streets gets even more frantic when ethan hunt drives against traffic and the scene becomes even more exciting when mcquarries lens allows us to see the danger in all its glory    the mission impossible franchise has been notable for its insane stuntwork but also chiefly after the second installment its edict to practical effects and maintaining the believability of its reality its still movie spy shenanigans and globetrotting adventures yes but the momenttomoment thrills feel like theyre really happening the fast and furious franchise has gained great acclaim for the bombast of its physicsdefying spectacle and the mission impossible franchise seems to have gone purposely in the opposite direction its real tom cruise jumping off that building its real tom cruise riding through traffic on a motorcycle and its real tom cruise falling and climbing up a speeding helicopter during the thrilling finale cruise has had a death wish when it comes to throwing himself into the highwire stunts of his franchise but even at 56 years old hes still at it essentially trying to commit suicide on film for all of our amusement cruise is one of the few remaining movie stars and his commitment is without question    this is also the first mission impossible film that feels like the characters matter its a direct continuation from the previous film 2015s rogue nation bringing back the somewhat lackluster villain the newest spy counterpartpotential love interest the cia and imf brass and the essential supporting team members from prior engagements because of this it feels more like what happened previously was establishment for a new story building upon that foundation rather than starting all over the characters find ways to deepen their relationships and the film opens up ethan hunt as a character and the toll his duty takes on those closest to him there are some nice quiet moments that examine these characters as actual people several complications are as a direct result of personal character decisions some good and some bad i was joking with my pal ben bailey beforehand about wondering whether theyd find a way for ving rhames to matter since he hasnt been much more than a guy in the van for four movies and by god they make him matter they make each team member matter finding moments to give them minigoals theyre entrusted with during the dizzying helicopter chase in the finale supporting players are left with their own task luther has to defuse a bomb but doesnt have enough hands benji has to find something valuable in a very needlehaystack situation designed to torment and waste precious time ilsa is at crosspurposes for most of the film not wanting to harm her fellow allies but also being given her own orders to prove her loyalty and protect her future all of this comes to a head and it makes the parts feel as important as the whole thats great storytelling    lets talk about that milliondollar mustache of cavills it was a year ago that justice league reshoots required cavill and the mission impossible team refused to allow their actor to shave his mustache thus leading to that unsettling fake baby lip superman was sporting in a majority of his scenes in the haphazard justice league film i just read an av club interview with mcquarrie where he for the first time discusses the whole mustache brouhaha and apparently paramount estimated that it would have cost them three million for the effects to uphold cavills upper lip continuity warner brothers refused to pay up and so went down that illfated cgi mustacheremoving route it was shortly afterwards that cruise shattered his ankle in a roofleaping stunt that is in the finished film and advertisements and the production had to shut down for a month if only warner brothers had waited perhaps we all could have avoided this mustache mess    mission impossible  fallout is a new highpoint for the best action franchise going in movies today im still waiting for a third raid film gareth evans the set pieces are memorable and unique leading from one into the next with exquisite precision and thought the action sequences are stunning and shot with stunning photography highlighting the stunning stuntwork by the best deathdefying professionals its the first mission impossible movie that doesnt climax at its middle in fact theres a pretty obvious reveal that feels like it was going to be a late act three twist but mcquarrie recognizes the audience thinking ahead and theres like a whole other exciting 45 minutes after the stakes are better felt because the characters matter and are integrated in meaningful ways this is the most ive enjoyed henry cavill in a movie with possible exception of another spy movie man from uncle and you know what his mustache works too while the vertigoinducing burj khalifa sequence is the best set piece in the franchise fallout has everything else beat at every level mission impossible  fallout is a reminder that there are few things in the world of cinema better than a properly orchestrated properly filmed and properly developed action movie operating at full throttle this is one of the reasons why we go to the movies folks see it in imax if possible soak it up    nates grade a
Aug 5 2018,positive,this movie was pretty good it was a rush of adrenaline defiantly the best mi movie i have seen
Aug 5 2018,positive,exhilarating action packed and amazing missionn impossible lives up to be a another take in the franchise and once again brings us another great performance from tom cruise and his stunts i was pumped for the most part of the film which had really memorable and outstanding action sequences that blew me away i can see alot of the film really tried hard with the stuntwork and it was amazingly well brought the story is alright but it doesnt deliver anything new to the franchise and is something weve seen for a while the cast however is really great like simon pegg who plays benji vin rhames as luther and everyone does a pretty outstanding job in their acting especially henry cavill who plays august walker without that cgi moustache lol and i though he was great though he kind of l from his character a little but was great as the villain as seen in the trailers from start to finish mission impossible fallout does whatever it can to be perfect and it is really top notch stuntwork performances were great loved the cast action sequences were breathtaking and i totally would recommend especially in the imax format though sadly only 2 scenes were shot with it but still definitely a thrill ride
Aug 5 2018,positive,the best mi yet wow
Aug 5 2018,positive,very scene tops the previous action scene it is much better than marvel movies the plot is serviceable but the energy is 100 follow by 100 more energy ithe direction action scenes and tom cruise make you put down your popcorn and watch my life is not better for seeing it but it was the best action filim in several years its not as good as driver
Aug 5 2018,positive,except for the main premise at the beginningwe know in real life that it would be the cia that actually starts a cholerasmall poxebola  plagueits an actionpacked good time i was waiting to see how they would top ethan hunts stunt where he flew from one airplane to another which they did
Aug 5 2018,positive,best mi yet keep them coming 
Aug 5 2018,positive,though starting a little slow once they got on the way it was one rollercoaster of a ride my heart was still racing after it was over a must see
Aug 5 2018,neutral,mission impossible  fallout is a 2018 american action spy film written produced and directed by christopher mcquarrie  being a big fan of the mi franchise i went into this film with high expectations  but left very disappointed it was too long and incredibly slow in parts to the point where i lost interest on a number of occasions the acting from some of the support characters was weak and wooden and the screenplay could have been much stronger many of the action scenes chases running etc were repetitive and i felt like there was very little new material here compared to previous films there wasnt the same level of complexity and plot twists that we are used to yes the cinematography is good the film finally found some dramatic tension towards the end but that was too little too late for me this is the weakest of the mi films to date mc
Aug 5 2018,positive,despite it feeling a little long mission impossible  fallout is consistently relentless in its action and spectacle
Aug 5 2018,positive,just slightly above ave for me
Aug 5 2018,positive,some of the best action scenes ive ever seen the whole last hour has you on the edge of your seat very suspenseful my favourite mi film

Aug 5 2018,positive,awesome best action movie this year
Aug 5 2018,negative,while the scenery and stunts were spectacular the movie itself  was incredibly boring i wasnt on the edge of my seat i knew who the bad guys was too soon the surprise character was so obviously going to show up and did all in all very disappointing
Aug 5 2018,positive,what a fantastic movie such an entertaining spy action movie i really liked the storyline and it was so exciting and there was great tension throughout and i really love that tom cruise does all his own stunts and tries to do everything as real as possible like flying the helicopter etc and since superman is my fav superhero im predisposed to liking henry cavill in anything  awesome movie
Aug 5 2018,positive,i took away a half because im not a tom cruise fan 
Aug 5 2018,positive,this movie has some of the most incredible and nail biting action scenes ever tom cruise and henry cavill together was a good deal minus one star for double cross triple cross and quadruple cross galore  too much brain power on the weekend
Aug 5 2018,positive,love it one of my favorite action films probably the best installment in the series thus far
Aug 5 2018,positive,best action movie since ant man and the wasp
Aug 5 2018,negative,over the top ridiculousness live action comic book just go ahead and animate it
Aug 5 2018,positive,fast paced action movie with some comedic moments with just as much twists and turns in the plot as in the high speed chases very enjoyable what we expect from a mi flick tom cruises age doesnt hold him down whatsoever
Aug 5 2018,negative,utterly boring and predictable with tom cruises usual nonentity acting the action set pieces were lifeless and unconvincing which is especially heinous considering they were mostly practical
Aug 5 2018,positive,omg such a great action movie best mi movie
Aug 5 2018,positive,amazing action scenes suspense and a performance from tom cruise worthy of 5
Aug 5 2018,positive,whereas bond got worse and worse after casino royale did mi only get better the cinematography the sounds and each and every action sequence raises the bar for action moves to come job well done had to wait a few months for it but i finally saw a real good movie this year
Aug 5 2018,positive,oh dear what a let down way too many plot holes to enjoy the film   far too many unexplainable  issues that are vital to the story line that leave you confused and questioning the rest of the film only gives you more issues i got so fed up with it i was prepared to leave the cinema half way through but got overruled by my partner a fair chunk of the action has been seen many times before eg the cliche car chase however the slight tinges of humour were very good ultimately it feels like they stitched the film together but never watched it all and rushed it out
Aug 5 2018,negative,i dont know what people are liking in this movie  the dialog is hard to hear  the 3d is blurry and the story is hard to follow  i like the previous mis but this one is stupid  how many times can someone be kicked in the face and not be injured  geez
Aug 5 2018,positive,exciting right to the end 
Aug 5 2018,positive,christopher mcquarrie manages yet again to get the best out of tom cruise and the rest of mission impossibles stellar cast this and a massively completx plot come together to make fallout easily the best in the franchise and one of the best action movies of all time
Aug 5 2018,positive,its perfect fits the name mission impossible
Aug 5 2018,positive,action action action and a great story 
Aug 5 2018,positive,the most incredible mission impossible
Aug 5 2018,positive,cruise control    in his one man war against cgi tc becomes ethan hunt again and proceeds to do the impossible the actor is 56 and struggles not to look it especially against the females who love him tow of course are 20 years younger but he persists to do truly ridiculous stunts breaking his ankle in the process all for our entertainment    this one is so formulaic as to be laughable plot armoured to the tips of his spikes hair cruise and his buddies defuse the excitement as their is no danger of death all of the huffing and puffing around the absurd turbo fuelled action count for naught in this tom and jerry cartoon it is worse than a 1970s jame bond with the raging roger moore sure its fun great eye candy  but it is too easy for hunt to work out how to winill figure it out he responds to every absurd situation and of course he does he read the script he knows he will win    yes it is enjoyable despite all the silliness you cant keep your eyes off of it simon pegg and ving rames are again along for the ride and cruise uses the same writerdirector its toms film all the way  everyone else is a prop to his human superman and the dialogue reflects his centrality especially in the last cloying scenes the world needs tom cruise to ensure us that in the end all will be well    mi6 is pure cruise control
Aug 5 2018,positive,fun movie a touch too long 
Aug 5 2018,positive,this is the best spy movie ever
Aug 5 2018,positive,on the edge of the seat all the time this is the best mission yet

Aug 5 2018,negative,watched yesterday  crap 3
Aug 5 2018,negative,started off as a turd and just as you think maybe just maybe it will get better or finish well it disappoints even more the worst next to mi2

Aug 5 2018,positive,alec baldwin isnt good enough of an actor to be in mission impossible 
Aug 5 2018,positive,best in the series 
Aug 5 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is easily the best in the series beautifully crafted from beginning to end it isnt short on thrills amazing stunts  an amazing plot and amazing cast it has an awesome 3rd act with a plot twist as to who our villain is which leads into the best final battle ive seen tom cruise deserves an oscar for performing numerous awesome stunts throughout the movie this movie was absolutely awesome and worth a watch
Aug 4 2018,positive,wo this was a great summer movie tom cruise delivers again movie had a great twist and the action was awesome go see it now
Aug 4 2018,negative,pales in comparison to other mi films  great stunts by tom cruise but the movie drags

Aug 4 2018,positive,this movie is awesome the best mi yet tom cruise does not get enough credit as an incredible actor he is the bomb
Aug 4 2018,positive,good action sequences i dont expect oscar performance but the acting is adequate  however if you want some really really creative action scenes this is the one
Aug 4 2018,positive,it is staggering to see that these mission impossible flicks actually seem to keep getting better on the surface this sixth entry in its highoctane fastpaced yet patientlyconceived thrillfest of a franchise is a rocket launcher with enough firepower to skyrocket any action junkie into divine explosive sensations of adrenalized intoxication however this astronomical energy is further complimented by a rich dosage of both character value and transparency this movie manages in an admirable fashion to project the weight of the struggles emotions decisions and consequences of its characters in a manner that feels genuinely substantial and even palpable to the audience  a very rare feat to such extent in an action blockbuster here the filmmakers want these characters to be understood as people instead of just being applauded for looking cool and the distinct effectiveness of these efforts is solidified through three main aspects 1 the ultimate threat against humanity in the film the sheer scope of destruction and terror infused in it is heavily based in reality to where the uprising of a similar danger in our modern society is entirely believable 2 the characters are individually and cohesively motivated to save people simply for the sakes of humanity and their loved ones rather than be coerced by a stereotypical calltoarms scenario revenge rescuing the damsel in distress etc and 3 the movie quickly and clearly establishes that failure is a definite possibility presenting a whole new fullyloaded tension tablet for the audience to swallow in short the movie honorably convinces its audience that there are deeper reasons to care for these characters and the outcomes of their missionswhich is more than can be said for most movies of a similar caliber movies like this are noteworthy and prove that action blockbusters can be much more than fluffy explosive popcorn summer moneymakers
Aug 4 2018,positive,at some point tom cruise is riding the same bike i have and he crashes that made me very sad fist to heart peace sign to sky other than that this is as good as action movies can get perfect in imax this franchise is the only one that never disappoints and by now they got the formula to a t great cast awesome action sequences fantastic pacing and theyre pushing the limits of impossible haha i so funny situations just enough that we stand at the edge of suspension of disbelief without falling over
Aug 4 2018,positive,evbody shooting at each other stabbing car chases makeup double agents car chases motorcycle chases helicopter chasesboy can that man run
Aug 4 2018,positive,awesome movie action packed from beginning to end
Aug 4 2018,positive,one of the best film in the series of mi films intense gripping and full of state of the art gadgets heres to more mi films 
Aug 4 2018,positive,the film its so good you must watch it
Aug 4 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout review fallout is the newest movie in the mission impossible series the last two movies have been the best of the franchise yet but this one is the best yet the plot was so good it kept you on edge and it was very engaging tom cruise was once again good as ethan henry cavill was my favorite part of the movie he did such a good job the action sequences are some of the best that ive seen in a movie in quite a while they were so thrilling so much happened in the film that sometimes it was jut a little too much at times but still it was good the final act was probably the best part of the movie the score was pretty good compared the previous films the only problem i had was that it was just a little too long otherwise it was the best action film in ages and i dont want to spoil anything so you can see it for yourself my grade a
Aug 4 2018,neutral,there was action but the movie lacked a good script and strong story  my husband loved it so maybe its more of a guy movie
Aug 4 2018,positive,great pace to movie awesome action scenes 
Aug 4 2018,positive,the best movie ever period
Aug 4 2018,positive,at first i didnt know what to think about this film after i watched it it was vastly entertaining great humor and some plot twists that i never knew would come but after i started to realize that this may just be the best film of the franchise and one of the best films of 2018 if you have not watched this film yet then you dont know what your missing
Aug 4 2018,positive,best action movie in years
Aug 4 2018,positive,great and entertaining movie  tom cruise is amazes with the stunts he still does  one of the best movies i have seen this year
Aug 4 2018,negative,it was action packed but way too long i loved it but would have loved it more if it had been shorter i actually ended up falling asleep while watching
Aug 4 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is another excellent entry into one of the best action franchises still making movies today its truly amazing a 6th film could be this good   tom cruise is ethan hunt once more and kicks ass once more as well the stunts he performs are astounding he continues to do ridiculous things for our entertainment cruise knows his character like the back of his hand he plays the imf agent so effortlessly there simply isnt anyone else better to be the star of your movie in this blockbusterdriven world the rest of the cast is also awesome with many returning names such as simon pegg ving rhames alec baldwin rebecca ferguson and sean harris as the infamous solomon lane meanwhile new names henry cavill and angela bassett slide in perfectly to the franchise   there are so many positive things to say about this movie the plot kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time i could never predict what would happen next i never knew who to trust there were always twists and turns around the corner the setpieces are as crazy and thrilling as ever this movie is action at its finest want a great fight scene or what about a shootout or a car chase or even better a helicopter chase in every aspect this movie delivers the villains are strong and can hold their own solomon lane while in a more reserved role is still as menacing as ever while the stop the nuclear weapons from going off plot isnt wholly original the movie is able to keep it fresh through adding its own sophistication and nuance to it i really liked ghost protocol so i have trouble saying this is the best of the franchise but regardless this is a great action movie   your mission if you choose to accept it is to make sure you see this movie in theaters because i know i may have to see this one a second time it was so awesome
Aug 4 2018,negative,it was like every other action movie theres been and was boring  it was way too long  nothing original was shown it lacked in dialogue no thought processing was required the main actors arent good actors here
Aug 4 2018,positive,tom cruise being took cruise when will he get old
Aug 4 2018,positive,good moviejust a little thrown off by the hype 
Aug 4 2018,positive,just make sure you take a xanax before you see the movie
Aug 4 2018,positive,everything you want in an action movie
Aug 4 2018,positive,with breathtaking action sequences and tom cruise in one of your best performances fallout is the best movie of the franchise
Aug 4 2018,positive,best mission impossible yet
Aug 4 2018,positive,nonstop action i think this was the best of the series
Aug 4 2018,positive,this had very much action with quite a few intense scenes tom cruise was very good solving the impossible  there is always that classic unreal scene in missoion impossible 
Aug 4 2018,positive,excellent action thriller  top notch in all aspects from where i sat  well worth a look see  enjoy
Aug 4 2018,positive,this movie is all hype its no different from all the other mission impossibles no real surprises a few cool chase scenes nothing special or unique as advertised 
Aug 4 2018,neutral,if youve seen the last 3 christopher nolan movies and skyfall then youve seen shotforshot all of the first hour of the movie to the point where it becomes fantastically boring this section is also not helped by tom cruise and henry cavills flat and fairly uninterested performances which are very prevalent throughout the second hour is when the film actually starts to move into something original and this is where it begins to shine so my recommendation is to show up to this movie an hour late then youll get an all around fun action movie experience it doesnt deserve the 98 it wont change your life the ending action scenes elevate what will ultimately be a forgettable movie i give it a 55
Aug 4 2018,positive,tom please forgive me for doubting the value of your skills in keeping this series alive  i loved it   how does anyone not love this movie    action twists intensityi keep thinking that chase scenes cant be improved onboy am i wrong   love the cast and the plot   characters are so engrossing and fun    see this one now
Aug 4 2018,positive,as much fun as the other outings tom cruise and crew deliver another impossible mission  dont expect to see any tense moments of infiltration like the other movies though this is an action movie  see this one in theaters
Aug 4 2018,positive,huge improvement over the last two movies honestly my favotire mi movie yet
Aug 4 2018,neutral,july 27 2018    benji how close were we    ethan the usual    benji huh the usual    this isnt just the second to last dialogue exchange in mission impossible fallout its also a summary of the preceding two and a half hours if ever there was a typical mission impossible moviethe template of which was forged nearly a quarter century agothis is it fallout much like rogue nation before it seems determined to stay completely inside the lines set and maintained by its fellow mission brethren as well as other spyaction movies in fact of rogue nation i had written the movie left me feeling cautious and uncertain about future mi installmentscruise and the filmmakers seem willing to water down and reuse the plots on which the action and stunts hang im not sure how long this approach can go on unfortunately fallout confirms to me it cannot go on any longer or at least it shouldnt im sure the movie will still be a huge financial success and its the first mission movie i cant justifiably recommend    it tears me up inside to write such words because as a series of technical exercises and highly elaborate stunt sequences fallout is stupendous and exceptional and often the best of its kind on paper its ambitions as a spy thriller at least as far as spectacle should have yielded quite the mesmerizing moviegoing experience but oddly enough as a movie doesnt feel experiential it plays as more of a model that future second unit directors stunt coordinators and editors might study in order learn how to seamlessly execute action sequences of the highest caliber and complexity from an academic point of view i would recommend it hands down but from a narrative one i needed more than just the standard mission plot to engage me    speaking of the plot if the films closing dialogue summed it up as the usual then the opening scene in not so explicit of words essentially promises the same thing during the trademark this is your mission should you choose to accept it encrypted recording spyagent ethan hunt tom cruise receives word that members of the terrorist organization known as the syndicate led by the nowcaptured but still very dangerous solomon lane sean harris and which hunt sought to prove the existence of in rogue nation have recently resurfaced and formed a new faction called the apostles they are partnering with a faceless zealot named john lark who has written a manifesto that outlines a fanatical plan to wipe the earth clean of corruption and sin in order to begin it anew its your typical megalomaniacal scheme which will begin with lark contaminating enough of the worlds water supply to eliminate onethird of the planets population    to carry out this annihilation lark has tasked the apostles with acquiring three plutonium cores which hell use to make a nuclear bomb that will detonate atop the mountains surrounding pakistan india and china that is unless hunt and his trusted impossible mission force imf teamluther stickell ving rhames and benji dunn simon peggcan intercept the cores first and indeed they have the chance but during a tense exchange at the beginning of the film hunt must choose between obtaining the cores and saving a member of his own teams life and in the end his teammate wins out leaving the cores as they say in the wind    so what was once a seemingly straightforward mission becomes yet again a most complicated operation that takes hunt and his cohorts all over the world from belfast to paris to london and eventually kashmir as they attempt to retrieve the plutonium and prevent three nuclear bombs from going off and if you think things wont boil down to the last possible millisecond complete with a red digital readout then youre obviously not familiar with the usual mission devices    usual or not one of the elements that has always kept the mission movies grounded is the humanity and likability of the characters and both of those are in full swing here despite the absurdity of the plot in fact its hunts decision to spare one human life at the potential cost of millions that imf secretary alan hunley alec baldwin now so hard to imagine not as donald trump finds so admirable about him the same cannot be said of cia director erica sloane angela bassett who doesnt trust the imf and insists her own agent augustus walker henry cavill accompany hunt when he must parachute from high above paris to meet the mysterious white widow vanessa kirby at the grand palais shes supposedly the broker between john lark and the apostles but one of the running themes throughout the mi movies is that aside from the good guys nobody really is who they say are the reveal of each characters actual identity and loyalty is so common a ploy in this series that its fairly easy to guess who will come out either as a savior or as a doublecrosser and the fact that it is so easy now dilutes some of the fun    still the movie does have a consistent momentum and to writerdirector christopher mcquarries credit hes the only filmmaker to helm two mission movies following rogue nation he doesnt dumb things down and the standard labyrinthine plot set by the original mission continues here but again because such a quality has become so routine it simply doesnt render the same effect it once did because we anticipate the narrative being overstuffed and convoluted fallout merely meets our expectations instead of going beyond them     the same goes for the otherwise incredible stunts and action sequences which range from the aforementioned skydive an intense martial arts fight in a night club mens room a motorcyclecar chase on the narrow streets of paris a fullthrottle run across the rooftops of london and a superior dual helicopter battle over snowcapped mountains each of these is executed with great vigor detail and conviction and had they been the first of their kind mission impossible fallout might have been one of the most memorable action movies in recent memory however as extreme sensational and uncompromising as these sequences are the fact remains they are not original but simply performed to a greater degree than what weve seen before the movie essentially takes what other action movies including previous mi movies have done and pumped them full of steroids and i needed it do more than just beef things up    to give you an idea the bathroom fight right down to the lighting design feels like it was yanked right out of true lies while the paris chase mirrors a similar sequence in the bourne identity meanwhile as hunt sprints across a series of roofs in london i couldnt help but recall him sprinting at the end of miiii in much the same way    so unfortunately the films usualness both with regard to its plot and its action ends up costing it too much excitement value dont get me wrongi fully recognize the filmmakers technical prowess as well as cruise and companys ceaseless and enthusiastic dedication but the hackneyed material ultimately undermines them and i left the theater feeling mostly underwhelmed    still even though fallout didnt marvel me like i hoped it did leave me hopeful because im confident this same team of filmmakers and actors can apply their energy and resources to fresher more worthy material this should be their mission going forward so lets hope they choose to accept it
Aug 4 2018,positive,best movie of the summer totally kicked a this is what a movie experience should be takes you into the most action packed adventure tom cruise rocks it utterly entertaining i love the whole cast 
Aug 4 2018,positive,it was a masterpiece
Aug 4 2018,positive,this movie took me on a ride by far one of the best of this year and i hope they keep walking on this path of great storytelling great action sequences great performancesi hope they will keep on going with this franchise
Aug 4 2018,neutral,i dont understand why this has such high ratings i love action moves but this was just ok yes the real stunts that tom cruise are good but i had more fun watching the fake stunts done on skyscraper
Aug 4 2018,positive,it was so great ive seen all of the mission impossible movies and i think that this is one of the best ones
Aug 4 2018,positive,as most people out there already know i love my movies and am always champing at the bit to check out the latest blockbuster    tonight was no exception as we cruised in to the ace cinemas to view the latest instalment in the mission impossible franchise    this version was like a multifaceted diamond where each facet shined boldly beyond belief    the first aspect that was worthy of mention was the return the very cool cast in tom cruise ving rhames and simon pegg playing the parts of legendary ethan hunt luther stickell and benji dunn    also returning was the potential love interest for ethan in rebecca ferguson as lisa    the producers also enlisted the services of the latest screen superman henry cavill he did a great job in adding some machismo manliness so as to try and rival ethans alpha dominance    alec baldwin is always a welcomed addition to any cast and was convincing as ethans boss albeit in somewhat of a cameo appearance    the second facet that shone was the plot which this time around involved a terrorist by the name of solomon lane who with a bunch of his socalled apostles was trying to acquire enough plutonium to create a nuclear catastrophe that would bring civilisation to its knees his philosophy was that peace on earth cannot truly be achieved without great suffering first there were the usual twists and turns weve come to expect in mi flicks as well as the par for the course backstabbing doublecrossing and even triplecrossing that spy stories seem to thrive on the only problem with this is that in the past the mi stories have been somewhat confusing and with that a tad frustrating the confusion on this occasion was there but thankfully nowhere near as bad    the third facet of these movies that never fails to disappoint is the intense action that has you on the edge of your seat from go to woe and with that i take my hat off to fiftysomething year old sir thomas cruise for defying fathertime with more of his amazing stunts and cleverly coordinated fight scenes whatever his endocrinologist has prescribed for him i want me some of that    the frantic facet of this film which was fantastic were the superb chase scenes that involved motorbikes cars trucks helicopters and of course that inimitable running technique of toms where you swear hes going to do himself an injury with the way those pointed fingers go perilously close to his eye sockets as his arms go up and down like human pistons    as a fan of bmw automobiles it was also nice to see them clearly sponsoring mission impossible with some of their magnificent mseries vehicles r nine t scrambler motorcycles and my favourite the classic 750il saloon    the fifth facet that for me was the most fascinating was the way the cinematographers masterfully used the art of filming iconic buildings cultural structures unique camera angles and majestic landscapes from around the world to enhance the whole viewing experience this artistry was not something you would normally expect in an action blockbuster but it was so craftily embedded that it kind of snuck up on you as the film progressed by the end you realised that not only were you fatigued from the all the suspense and action but you were simultaneously superimpressed by the sheer visual splendour    the final facet that cannot be understated is the marvellous music that weve all loved since the iconic tv series started back in the late 1960s the musical directors have obviously tweaked it slightly with some clever remixes but it was nice to hear some of the original theme music too    in closing all i can say is    your mission if you choose to accept it is to get your ass into the cinemas to watch this spectacle before it selfdestructs and heads off to dvd    cws rating this time around4 and 12 stars 
Aug 4 2018,positive,an efficient action movie too bad simon peg is underused cmpared to the previous opus
Aug 4 2018,positive,way better than expected action packed good acting and entertaining through out couldnt have asked for more really awesome movie not my favorite action movie ever but it was one of if not the best in the series so far and easily the best action film of 2018 thus far
Aug 4 2018,positive,the best parts of all the previous films masterfully plotted in an action masterpiece filled with gasp inducing thrills
Aug 4 2018,positive,engaging story and great setpieces but not much else the additional characterisation is rather predictable and i never really believed the mission could fail
Aug 4 2018,negative,for those who like to eat in only one restaurant and order the same meal time after time again this movie is for you mr cruise has somehow absorbed partial powers from spiderman superman batman all thats missing is a killer costume to match i came home and watched mi part 3 after watching mi 6 hugely more believable and entertaining sorry tommy
Aug 4 2018,positive,thrilling imaginative well edited plot line value for money
Aug 4 2018,neutral,less compelling than an episode of scoobydoo this was easily the least satisfying of the franchise suffering from clunky unfocused direction and a strange performance from an otherwise reliable tom cruise that made his character ethan hunt into a weak bumbling fool  stunt work was stiffly choreographed visual effects were passable but obvious  the script was silly predictable and flat and the whole thing seemed  phoned in by everyone involved  a low water mark for cruise who is capable of much better work and a waste of an otherwise talented cast
Aug 4 2018,positive,97 rotten tomatoes rating is somehow an understatement spectacular movie there arent enough stars
Aug 4 2018,positive,topnotch movie all mission impossible movies are good but this one is a cut above the rest the action seems to be more frequent and constant and yet the story is free flowing and easy to follow most of it anyway     there also seems to be a little bit more humor on this one and not just from simon pegg very entertaining just a must see movie for me    i also get to learn a new favorite phrase fate whispers to the warrior a storm is coming the warrior whispers back i am the storm  d
Aug 4 2018,positive,excellent action flick  watch the previous one again beforehand if you can and itll help w the storyline
Aug 4 2018,negative,predictable sloppy overrated almost makes me think that rt is rigged so bad 
Aug 4 2018,positive,how is it possible tom cruise is getting better with age best mission impossible and one of the best action films in years
Aug 4 2018,positive,not big tom cruise fan but this was pretty good also henry cavill is in it so bonus 
Aug 4 2018,negative,it provided decent laughs which is not great for an action movie 
Aug 4 2018,positive,if you like the mission impossible movies you wont be disappointed however at 2 12 hours long it could use some editing the plotstoryline didnt need 2 12 hours
Aug 4 2018,positive, in the latest installment of mi6 this movies length helped characters and the story unfold easier and more naturally it was quite the ride taking me back to the good ole ethan hunt we know and love from the first mission impossible film
Aug 4 2018,positive,great movie surprising twists 1 problem is the music is just autotuned han zimmer temp tracks
Aug 4 2018,negative,come forth and contribute to tom cruises latest kickstarter as he attempts every stunt known to man under his guise as the infamous ethan hunt what you thought scaling the burj al khalifa infiltrating the kremlin and cia and generally kicking arse on every continent in the previous mis wasnt enough youd be right wouldnt you sure when you step into the cinema to see the latest mi youre not expecting tarantinos intricate dialogue nor nolans cinematic artistry you come expecting tom cruise doing what he does best explosions double crosses car chases iconic villains and a myriad of exotic locations not forgetting those bloody masks and it delivers on all of these especially the masks so ver many masks and yet and yet i feel they really dropped the ball on this one the sheer preposterousness of it all case in point ethan and henry cavill have to get to paris to stop a meeting between two people dont ask who the people are i still dont have a clue instead of buying them a couple of easyjet tickets from london and a taxi from de gaulle the cia or imf or is it mi6 decide to parachute them in from 25000 feet if that wasnt bad enough they neglected to check the weather forecast as there was a lighting storm going on to add to the drama  this ridiculous formula continues throughout the film as hunt constantly neglects to do the obvious logical things in order to achieve his objectives this comes to its apex at the climax of the film as hunt squares off against the baddies number one henchman its mano e mano hunt needs to get the special device the henchman has and hunt makes such a task infinitely more difficult because he forgot to bring his gun along with him really bond and bourne surely wouldnt make such a rookie mistake verdict a total lack of originality an absence of humour and clarity all combine to bring you the weakest instalment of the franchise next time ethan please remember to bring your gun
Aug 4 2018,positive,simply the best action movie in years 25h twist on twist and extraordinary stunt watch it on a big screen
Aug 4 2018,positive,watching jaw dropping authentic firsthand stunts all done by cruise at age 56 with limited assistance from cgi was an experience in itself everyone just appreciate that a franchise still delivers from a classic feel good spy action movie recipe
Aug 3 2018,positive,how can you not enjoy this movie saw it in imax which was great 
Aug 3 2018,negative,cartoon action boring predictable poor plot
Aug 3 2018,positive,tom cruise almost never disappoints in the mission impossible movies great job christopher mcquarrie did a great job directing this is the best mission ive seen so far in the mission impossible stories a possible best action movie of the year or at least that would i vote for it
Aug 3 2018,positive,perhaps the greatest action film ever
Aug 3 2018,positive,best movie from the series the story and plot is compelling and interesting while maintaining fantastic action sequences go watch it
Aug 3 2018,positive,mi6 was actually a real and good action movie was it perfect  i guess not  maybe i mean cruise did break his ankle jumping from building to building i can judge a good movie if you really watch the movie which is actually pretty darn good some say 20 minutes too long you will notice the impressive major stunts that tom cruise actually physically did himself maybe if tom jumped the fountain at caesars palace on a motorcycle you might be impressed probably not though you would find a way mi6 stands up well regardless of the stupid one star ratings that the disenfranchised gave i believe it was 2015 me and my teenage son went to see mad max fury road we were like wow that was insane and it had crazy stunts too down in the outback a raw and entertaining action movie walking out of the theater from this mad max movie people were talking and a black lady by herself middleaged or so and she commented to herself that was terrible i looked at my son and i said if the movie was so terrible and it was raw why didnt she leave the movie theater much sooner  she could have left well before the halfway point instead of watching the whole thing mi6 is definitely a good action movie and it stands up well with the characters and dialogue if this genre of movie does not excite you then go watch something else no mi6 will not displace gone with the wind on the alltime movie list but it was never intended to if you enjoy a great action movie watch mi6 in imax or an upscale home theater system 
Aug 3 2018,positive,while a 97 on rotten tomatoes is far too generous i will say this movie will exceed your expectations greatly if you think its just another installment of the mission impossible series this movie brought plenty of creative and never before done stunts that truly will wow you ethan hunt did not dissapoint
Aug 3 2018,positive,great action movie 
Aug 3 2018,negative,one mindless stunt after another with minimal banal dialogue between stunts i wanted to leave after 5 minutes but my companion wanted to see it all
Aug 3 2018,positive,ups the ante for insane stunts and sets the gold standard for summer blockbuster cruise has still got it even while he moves towards his sixties the only question that remains unanswered was that mustache of cavills worth all the trouble
Aug 3 2018,positive,go if you like to watch tom cruise doing stunts otherwise its a c moviesee at home
Aug 3 2018,positive,great action well written well acted but just like james bond movies formulaic and i figured out who the bad guy was before the first hour was up maybe its a gift or they needed to be a little trickier a good motorcycle race is great and all but i want to be shocked give me a usual suspects ending to one of these and ill rank accordingly 
Aug 3 2018,positive,lives up to the hype nonstop action all the double crossing and switch ups keep the plot fresh definitely the best of the franchise and possibly one of the action genre greats 
Aug 3 2018,positive,fantastic tom cruise still has it and just the fact alone that he does those stunts is worth going to see the movie id definitely recommend seeing the previous film beforehand as this is a direct sequel
Aug 3 2018,positive,creme de la creme of action movies looking forward to viewing it again
Aug 3 2018,positive,wow  the finale makes your hands sweat due to the intensity of the scene
Aug 3 2018,positive,great movie full of action
Aug 3 2018,positive,great movie his bestmission impossible by far
Aug 3 2018,positive,one of the most suspenseful action adventure movies of the year photography is breathtaking terrific plot
Aug 3 2018,positive,the set pieces are fresh and its been a while since you see an action movie that done something new such as jumping in a superhigh altitude passing through a storm but other than that the story fell flat predictable and the acting also felt b rated last thing is the film felt a bit old theres not much young energy running around  in the film
Aug 3 2018,positive,wow its been a while since i have been this impressed with an action movie if you are getting tired of big summer blockbusters that all feel the same and arent actually exciting go check this one out
Aug 3 2018,negative,too confusing the plot was hard to follow and too many chase and fight scenes
Aug 3 2018,positive,this movie is one of the best movies ive seen its action packed all the way through
Aug 3 2018,positive,what a great movie 
Aug 3 2018,negative,time for this franchise to retire like cruise
Aug 3 2018,positive,one of the best mi action sequences were filmed incredibly
Aug 3 2018,negative,movie was boring effects were bad unrealistic actionacting good hired a list actors for a f list movie 
Aug 3 2018,positive,an amazing movie worth the watch
Aug 3 2018,positive,a surge of what you would expect a carefully interlaced european mission with unexpected thrills and some truly tense car chase scenes a classic action film that surpasses most of the genres latest inferior offerings
Aug 3 2018,negative,i actually left in the middle it looked way too fake it was just chase after chase after chase stupid plot just the fact that tom cruise was driving through a hundred automobile with his foot hanging down off to peg was totally unacceptable for anybody that has ever ridden a motorcycle way too fake way too hyped up to do all this new stuff and they totally left what made all the other movies so great to watch behind in the dust
Aug 3 2018,positive,the best mi ever tom continues to awe and surprise entertaining and breathtaking 
Aug 3 2018,positive,3818 with guntars at elizabeth cinema long action flick not bad
Aug 3 2018,positive,one of the best mission impossible films story is predictable but tension is good i do have to say that the stunts arent as amazing as in previous films climbing the burj khalifa is still the best in the franchise 
Aug 3 2018,neutral,this movie was ok the action was amazing but i have not seen any other movies in the series it tied into those movies a lot this movie used a lot of spy tropes
Aug 3 2018,positive,mission impossible is without a doubt the best action franchise in hollywood today and fallout takes everything great about the series and magnifies it despite his age this is easily tom cruises best performance out of the six movies thus far both as an actor as well as a stuntman the action and thrills here best even the exhilarating ghost protocol and the beautiful camerawork packs as much punch as possible into every ounce of it the film is relentlessly suspenseful and the characters on both sides of this fight are executed amazingly by their respective actors the story makes great use of this too providing some of the most emotionally intense writing since the third entry the story does harken back to the initial films complexity and tone but in a way that respects the franchise while the other elements innovate it the final product here cannot be overstated its the best action film since mad max fury road and without a doubt the definitive blockbuster of the year
Aug 3 2018,positive,must see to all action fans
Aug 3 2018,negative,im usually at least close in alignment with rotten tomatoes not this time i was amazed at how i felt about this after the raving reviews it really makes me scratch my head about the validity of how user and critic reviews drive and bias our interpretations of modern media     regardless at times i was having a grand old time towards the end the helicopter scene especially i couldnt help but keep looking over at my wife to see if i was the only one who was in awe of how bad it was always to find her rolling her eyes validating my bewilderment there were some cute themes as well but the romantic component seemed pretty forced all in all ill give it a little love with the 15 stars but i cant believe how noncritical these critics are sometimes
Aug 3 2018,positive,loved it my body aches from being tense for 3 hours
Aug 3 2018,positive,the best spy movie i have ever seen the cinematography was done fantastically the fight and action scenes were spectacularly the stunts that tom cruise performed were insane and awesome tom cruises performance was great rebecca ferguson ving rhames henry cavill and simon pegg also have great performances i also loved the moments of comic relief the movie score was also spectacular a from me
Aug 3 2018,positive,loved it actioned packed with great stunts and many twists kept me at the edge of my seat very entertaining 
Aug 3 2018,positive,perhaps i went in with my expectations too high but i didnt see this installment as any different than the rest seeing the preview for this movie gave me chills every time so i admit i was wanting quite a bit going in turns out all the best scenes were in that preview all the mission impossibles still lack the subterfuge of the original but the amazing action sequences allow us to forgive the absurd death of the mole at the end was so ridiculous it was a bit of an anticlimax you couldnt help but think of wile e coyote on that one the cast was a great ensemble and went a long way for the overall feel except for cavill i guess he cant act shame
Aug 3 2018,positive,want of the best in the franchise so far just when you thought the movie is ending they take it up a notch and give you even more action love it cant wait for the next one
Aug 3 2018,positive,tom cruise this is heqrt pounding this is the best in the franchise
Aug 3 2018,positive,mission impossible   fallout is a white knuckle action thriller with unexpected twist and turns throughout if your a fan of the franchise this is the best one yet and a must see if your not a fan of the franchise there is still enough here to keep you entertained considering its one of the best action flicks of the decade
Aug 3 2018,negative,painfully long cliches throughout bad acting  i took my adult son to see this and as we were whispering to each other about whether or not to leave we witnessed two people get up and leave  ha  we left before the final credits rolled  i so badly wanted to be engaged and on the edge of my seat  instead i was snickering rolling my eyes squirming for it to please end and shaking my head
Aug 3 2018,positive,in my opinion mission impossible is the single most impeccably entertaining spy franchise in history forget womanizing toocoolforschool bond forget everchanging overlyserious jack ryan forget forgetful mirthless bourne ethan hunt is my spy idol and with fallout mcquarrie and cruise have delivered easily their most impossible and best mission yet a globe trekking twistingandturning intensely exciting sequel that continues and expands the reigning power of this unlikely blockbuster franchise  once again hunt and his crew find themselves amid a potential global disaster on the outs with their own government and the criminal underground what sets this one apart is its story and plot connections with the previous films where the others are essentially standalone outings letting you jump in where you please this one requires you to have a modicum of knowledge on hunt and his exploits allowing for growth in characters and stronger stakes in the villains mysterious plots   as expected there are an endless number of great reveals that beautifully unravel information only when necessary thanks to some stellar editing its predictable when it isnt important and unpredictable when it is making the mysteries and the marquee action scenes that much more impacting  honestly god bless tom cruise and his lack of selfpreservation at 52 he is one of the last true action stars who sells a movie purely by putting his name on it thanks largely to his renown for doing his own action and with bathroom fist fights helicopter chases and skydiving malfunctions what action it is i always think this should be the last mission with cruise before seeing the most recent outing by the end i just want more
Aug 3 2018,positive,what a derivative plot an unnecessary and unearned death cliche disarm the bomb storyline tagged on unexplained infiltration of the cia by a random super villain who somehow came into existence took over a huge number of cia swat guys and coordinated with a dude who has been in the super max of super max prison and all in just two years jesus christ this plot has so many holes i recommend you watch this movie with your brain off and just enjoy the ride i had fun the pace is breakneck and the performances are fun all around 
Aug 3 2018,positive,wooooow you might have seen one or all of the earlier mission impossible movies but i tell you baby you aint seen nothing yet this last one is the non plus ultra the real climax and the most true to the original series naturally in a modern way with a bombastic soundtrack and certain actions which reminds one of the sixtiesseventies full blast action excellent car chases etc from the beginning to the very end naturally there are scenes which defy the laws of physics but for actions sake well accept them tom is once again at his very best its really incredible that he doesnt use stuntmen for any of the action scenes i guess he must have a monstrous ego combined with balls of steel 9 of 10 points hardly any action fan wont enjoy this one ill surely watch it again
Aug 3 2018,positive,no long winded review hereexhilarating stunning and just plain awesome
Aug 3 2018,positive,this franchise never fails to entertain not on the same level as rogue nation but still a good time
Aug 3 2018,positive,non stop action and entertainment
Aug 3 2018,positive,brilliantly produced mission impossible fallout was an invigorating film from start to finish i can say without hesitation that this is one of the best action films i have seen to date with scenes that will make you laugh cry and fill the theatre with a tangible tension would absolutely watch again
Aug 3 2018,positive,action from beginning to end
Aug 3 2018,positive,3 stars it was ok but i expected more but just like most movies now adays mostly eye candy and a basic storyline
Aug 3 2018,positive,great movie full of action
Aug 3 2018,positive,too bad that storytelling as well as opportunities for welltimed humor and wit takes a backseat on this one to allow more time for engorged insane yet excellently executed action and stunts still a very good addition to the franchise
Aug 3 2018,positive,while individual plot point were drag and even sometimes stupid all stunts and action pieces make up for it in an sufficient overall plot
Aug 3 2018,positive,the action was the best ive seen in a mission impossible movie and therefore this movie gets some rating at all but overall the movie was quite cliche i knew almost all twists in this predictable movie that made romance or chemistry seem more like friendship the dialogues were poor and it seemed more like a marketing gimmick to make sure tom cruise as an action hero is still relevant
Aug 3 2018,positive,cheesy in the traditional mission impossible ways love it 
Aug 3 2018,positive,best of the series so far
Aug 3 2018,positive,considering ive never seen a mission impossible movie until now i think it is very well put together great acting plot and action at no moment was i generally bored or annoyed great film
Aug 3 2018,positive,great action great plot twists great performances especially by tom cruise and henry cavill the bathroom fight scene and the helicopter chase are among the best people action movie history the car chase seemed a bit long but still entertaining my only nitpicks are the some plot twists are bit predictable by this point and the series feels a bit too derivative of previous mi entries and the james bond thrillers also the film does start to feel overlong by the third act but still highly entertaining
Aug 3 2018,positive,great filming lots of action 
Aug 3 2018,positive,epic action movie that out bonds bond easily the best action movie of the year
Aug 3 2018,positive,the best in the series of mission impossible movies tom cruise at his best as well as supporting cast the action sequences are awesome the story fits with the rest and keeps you entertained from m the start loves it
Aug 3 2018,positive,i wasnt in the right mood initially and nearly walked out about an hour in intending to catch it properly another time then i settled into my seat and just let myself enjoy this romp  and its quite a romp  its a little like casino royale  a movie that takes the established conventions and then cuts through some of the schmaltzy hollywood stuff to deliver something that feels more authentic  it didnt hurt that the opening scene was shot at milford sound in nz  a lovely place i was visiting about a month ago   were all living through the postfury road world too  that movie has already had a wide impact on visual story telling i am going back to see this one  its pretty good
Aug 2 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an amazing commercial action movie its eyepopping actions to reveal that tom cruise is nobody else is willing to be
Aug 2 2018,positive,a lot of unrealistic scenes but overall i enjoyed this film
Aug 2 2018,negative,its got tom cruise in it enough said
Aug 2 2018,positive, i loved this movie great acting and action 
Aug 2 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is one of the best action movies ever made the action sequences are the best ive nearly ever seen and there is a lot of them
Aug 2 2018,positive,arguably the best mission impossible movie yet or at least top 3
Aug 2 2018,positive,action packed this movie had you spinning your head in a lot of directions i enjoyed it a lot and tom cruise is an amazing actor this is a movie to go see
Aug 2 2018,positive,best mission impossible good all around 
Aug 2 2018,positive,i definitely had my doubts but wow that was hands down the best out of all of them
Aug 2 2018,positive,amzing stunts including the halo jump loved it going again this weekend
Aug 2 2018,neutral,long and except for some scenes boring
Aug 2 2018,positive,very entertaining and very violent  8118
Aug 2 2018,positive,they keep getting better
Aug 2 2018,positive,thrilling action amazing cinematography that helps convey the intensity of the film predictable villain but the film knew you were going to guess it that easily so they created an unpredictable set of events in what transpires after the reveal especially strong performance by henry cavill and another great addition to the mission impossible franchise
Aug 2 2018,negative,ive seen episodes of csi with better acting stupid and predictable laughably bad if this movies gets a 97 i have genuine concerns for the fate of humanity
Aug 2 2018,positive,great movie not much thrills from the last one but still great to watch 
Aug 2 2018,positive,these films just keep getting better and better tom cruise keeps upping the stakes and i dont know how he does it the addition of henry cavil was spectacular he brought a physicality that tom cruise just cant the bathroom fight scene alone is worth the price of admission the plot is not a stellar one but the heart and action make up for it chris mcqueary is a perfect director for this franchise and it is no doubt why they brought him back for this one as always ving reigns and simon pegg are great in their respective roles the support staff with witty one liners that keep the mood light in dark moments a must see in the theater if one has the chance to
Aug 2 2018,positive,just when you think tom cruise is too old for this nonsense a director comes along who works around it and makes him look like the action hero he used to be  the motorcycle scenes are the best of the chases
Aug 2 2018,positive,best action movie that ive ever seen
Aug 2 2018,positive,if you love action then this is your movie for everyone else though this movie leaves you wanting more tom cruise does manage to pull off some impressive stunts and still looks great doing it the villains in this seemed a little too fake it felt more like watching a movie version on a video game
Aug 2 2018,positive,fantastic  its cruise at his best again
Aug 2 2018,negative,did i just see that
Aug 2 2018,positive,theres obviously a working relationship between tom cruise and director christopher mcquarrie this being their third project together after the previous mi  rogue nation and the first jack reacher both films i was very impressed with overall especially the action sequences and i certainly wasnt disappointed here which makes me hope this relationship continues should the saga expand which im sure it will ethan hunt is back on the trail of trying to eliminate the shadowy terrorist organisation the syndicate following on from rogue nation theres the obvious threat to humanity and no ones seems to be able to stop it or even want to stop it apart from ethan hunt and the remaining imf team all sounds pretty standard for espionage spy actioners but theres a couple of little clever twists and conflict of interest even if quite predictable the team is much of the same characters we should all be familiar with the story again overlooks the absence of past members like jeremy renners brandt repeating what rogue nation did with paula pattons jane however the addition of henry cavills walker is a welcome change but does he do fill the boots of being hunts opposite and likely looming threat he sure is the hammer to hunts scalpel but i found him a little underwhelming and not menacing enough with this being the only weakness of the story personally i wished they developed his character a lot more but maybe im asking too much i was pleased to see vanessa kirby after watching her in the low budget kill command her character of the doublesided trickster fence was more intriguing than cavills walker the action is sharp and often brutal with some of the best slickest sequences of the entire series especially with cruises impressive stunt work which seems to be the foundation of this films hype believe me the hype is real and its actionpacked from start to finish with some little moments of heart there is one scene where i thought cruise was going to break into jerry maguires help me help you it doesnt let up hitting the audience hard and fast with fights car chases van chases motorbikes parachute jumps and helicopters it ticks all the boxes for what makes a great action film great this is a fest in itself for being the longest in the franchise but its downgraded its outrageous scenarios excluding the grand finale and this was actually very refreshing theres no scaling of the burj khalifa no free diving down a giant urinal or sliding down a glass building and dodging missiles its as if they wanted a more real action movie pushing aside the elaborate cgi effects and gave us a raw highoctane and grounded action piece instead of a cgi budget the money must have been spent of the editing and production units as the sequences and shoots are astonishing shot and equally spliced together and then theres those moments of heart which are mostly reserved for fergusons story arc adding to that conflict of interest there is a moment that had me echoing the same emotional connection i had with raimis spiderman 2 though im probably on my own with that one and these are both small and too far in between all the action that goes on barely giving the audience enough time to catch a breathe let alone digest whats going on though this is a negative observation and is a likely result of the film being a caffeinedosed version of the saga and then theres lorne baldes impressive score balfe is now one of my favourite composers however the zimmerish influence is impossible to deny you only have to listen to tracks change of plan to pick up zimmers batman trilogy or free fall to hear the looming threat of dunkirk but it perfectly incorporates lalo schifrins iconic theme throughout the score to hairraising effect balfe does this with such craftsmanship and respect to the original theme it becomes very much part of the score as oppose to just being a remixed or reworked version just listen to tracks the exchange and escape through paris to hear what im talking about it has to said because its something that normally niggles me when films get it wrong but whilst the timing might be a little off its geographically accurate in particular london all the scenes were spot on and its a refreshing change it might not be so obviously to most viewers but to me the london locations even the unimportant scenes are all in sync meaning you could draw a logical and chronological map of action in the city however i can only speak of london as paris im not too familiar with its the best of the series possibly because its actually more grounded yet upping the action content its going to be a hard movie to top i definitely want to go watch this again running time 9 the cast 9 performance 8 direction 10 story 8 script 8 creativity 9 soundtrack 9 job description 10 the extra bonus points 10 for being allout action packed 90 910 
Aug 2 2018,positive,the best movie ive watched in a while
Aug 2 2018,positive,great great action movie
Aug 2 2018,positive,it was okay but mainly just a load of running around shooting the acting was fine but it felt like theyd run out of ideas
Aug 2 2018,positive,the best mission impossible yet with some great twists and turns and absolutely outstanding stop work not to mention the fact that its the epitome of summer blockbuster
Aug 2 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is the sixth movie of the franchise with the same name so it is expected of it to be dull boring and cliche this movie however exceeds expectations in every way possible and shows heart and soul throughout what could very well just another payday for mr cruise and paramount pictures    we have come to expect mediocre action from action movies in recent years thanks to movies like fast  furious but here the fights the chases the neardeath situations are all very well shot and edited  not for one second will the viewer doubt that tom cruise is indeed capable of pulling off all these amazing stunts by himself this paired with a brilliant cast henry cavill once again shines this time as the villain great performances by vanessa kirby and the quirky duo of ving rhames and simon pegg delivers a phenomenal 2 and a half hours of cinema   still at times it all feels a little rough around the edges thanks to a sometimes confusing storyline that will make a good bunch of casual viewers tune out after a while even if at the end it all kind of  makes sense   the cinematography is tremendous with some seriously gorgeous shots of paris throughout the movie the soundtrack is good but nothing special     overall mission impossible  fallout delivers what it promises a thrilling actionmovie with a fantastic cast great action sequences and a competent plot its a wellstructured movie with relatable goodguys and detestable badguys and sometimes thats all its needed to make a good movie
Aug 2 2018,positive,when it comes to action movies tom cruise has no equal toms commitment to creating action films that give the audience their moneys has reached almost ridiculous levels with fallout to fall back on the old cliches this is a true whiteknuckle breathholding heartpounding action adventure that is excellently paced and perfectly executed the only thing more pleasing than the incredible action is the fact that this is probably the best story of the franchise leveraging not just ethans history but that of the team that hes assembled and evolved through the previous 5 films into a far more multifaceted character facing challenges which are personal global complex yet still straightforward or at least as complex as you can really get in an action film   most people know by now just how seriously cruise takes his action spending months honing new skills so he can do as many of his own stunts as possible and doing as many stunts as possible in camera he clearly expects demands and inspires the same level of excellence from everyone who works on his films and fallout may be the most extreme example of this nexus of passion talent expectation and execution  now as far as stories go fallout doesnt really do anything you havent seen in an mi film before the film is full of exhilarating chase sequences with cars motorcycles boats helicopters and of course tome cruise running  the story follows the familiar territory of the world in peril and the only thing standing in the way of its destruction is ethan hunt and his team who of course must at some point go it alone as again his agency turns its back on him youd think that this basic plot structure would get old and stale but in fact each film seems to refine and improve on this basic structure in a way that not only remains fresh and entertaining but when youre in the midst of it and you know that certain basic things are going to happenhave to happen  you for the most part have typically have very little idea where theyre going to come form specifically equally as impressive is that even though you can never see more than one step ahead the story while complex is never incomprehensibleyou are always given enough to understand what is happening whats at stake at any given moment and then it once all the strands are in place for the final showdown they still the conclusion remains tense and with enough risk to keep you deeply engaged throughout i was truly impressed at how after six films theyve managed to make each film better than the last with the exception of mi2 sorry that is the dog of this franchise and mi6 seems almost impossible to top in my opinion  fallout is the definition of a bigbudget action film
Aug 2 2018,positive,actually very good ive missed the previous ones to be honest but this action and stunts were very good
Aug 2 2018,negative,it just would not end the longest 15 minute timer ever
Aug 2 2018,positive,they say lightning never strikes twice much less three times yet for the third time in a row the mission impossible franchise has absolutely nailed it delivering heart pounding supremely satisfying summer entertainment    those who have seen the trailers will have a basic idea of the story ethan hunt and his team lost a trio of plutonium cores and now he has to get them back by whatever methods necessary now despite what the trailers suggest this movie is not about ethan snapping and going rogue the movie never even suggests it but it is very much about whether hell reach his limits and break his own most deeply held rules to complete the mission because with the stakes this high and with so many different players and agendas there may not be any way to save the world and keep his hands clean    this movie is also very much about ethans past in many ways this installment is a continuation of the last film featuring old friends and enemies and tying up loose plots threads you never noticed before so much of what happens here is the direct result of the missions ethan has completed and the choices he made before all of them weighing heavily on the choices he has to make now     after six installments in the series the filmmakers have fully perfected the mission impossible formula the pacing ranges from quick to breakneck the chases and shootouts are excellent as always and some of the fight scenes are worthy of hong kong henry cavil is a powerhouse the pure power of his fighting style is a perfect match for hunts kinetic improvisation fighting together they make a hell of a duo when they come to blows with each other its even better    and then there are the aerial sequences and other deathdefying stunts that no mission impossible movie would be complete without they may not top the data core scene from the last installment but they are still absolutely breathtaking i dont know how cruise is able to keep doing these kinds of stunts at his age but i cant argue with the results    and refreshingly the plot is more than just an excuse to string together the action scenes there are enough twists and stunning revelations to fill the best spy novel just when you think you know where its going it manages to surprise and raise the stakes even higher at times fallout is a bit darker and grimmer than previous installments occasionally it even brings a touch of pathos but the trademark wry humor is still there if a little more subdued    ultimately this movie has everything that a summer blockbuster should its tense exciting action packed and everything in it just works on the heels of ghost protocol and rogue nation its safe to say that the mission impossible franchise is delivering more consistently than than james bond i dont how long they can keep this up but i look forward to finding out
Aug 2 2018,positive,this is by far the best movie of the year theres a little of everything loved it
Aug 2 2018,positive,45 stars possibly the best in the series
Aug 2 2018,negative,bad speech and he tries to be cute by saving the policewomen   and his speech about saving the world is pathetic
Aug 2 2018,positive,love the series more action and more tom cruise 
Aug 2 2018,positive,an excellent rollercoaster of a film which is packed with action from start to finish the quickest youll ever spend two hours plus of your life
Aug 2 2018,positive,fantastic overall just some clunky dialogue for henry cavill early on in the movie
Aug 2 2018,positive,i went to see this a little worried that tim cruise couldnt hold up to the demand of such a packed a room franchisewow he really sells it still even after all these years  i think i can forgive the speedup on the film for the running sequences  an amazingly good action film that you dont need to have seen the previous films as this can stand alone    a good story set in many major cities as you would expect these films are each time closer to the bind films in setting and storyline    the leading cast did a great job and the villanova reveal if not s little telegraped was still entertaining    i would recommend this film for a great few hours of escapism
Aug 2 2018,positive,great action film one of the best in the franchise
Aug 2 2018,positive,its perfect cinematography
Aug 2 2018,positive,i saw this movie in imax highly recommeneded the helicopter chase was stunning in the bigger aspect ratio tom cruise performs some insane stunts and the action in this film is incredible the plot is a little confusing as it has a lot of information to process but the clever plot twists always keep you on edge and the jaw dropping action set pieces will keep you wondering what comes next easily one of the best movies this year
Aug 2 2018,positive,the original brian de palma classic will always have a special place in my heart but mission impossible fallout is easily my second favorite of the series admittedly i was underwhelmed by mi2 too many doves and straightup hated rogue nation too many reasons to address but i really enjoyed ghost protocol and fucking loved mi3 my former second favorite mi6 is hands down the best action movie of the summer and probably one of the best action films ever twists turns humor excitement and old school special effects are utilized to ensure you dont lose interest for a second this action extravaganza is two and a half hours the longest mi to date and i didnt breathe for 99 of it the film as a whole is unforgettable but the stunts in particular most of which were performed by cruise himself are impossibly good pun intended bitches this mi is a solid a
Aug 2 2018,positive,i did not think it was all that great  it was said that the ending will surprise you but come on we all know the ending  i found it very predictable and easy to figure out  i will give three stars for the stunts but that is a pity pat
Aug 2 2018,positive,a great time incredible action and escalation throughout the set pieces are fantastic and its a thrill ride from start to end cavill makes a great addition to the movies and its wonderful to see the series embrace its pastbringing in elements from prior films
Aug 2 2018,positive,easily the best in the longrunning mi franchise but possibly the best action movie ive seen in over 20 years as another critic stated it ranks among films like captain america the winter soldier skyfall the dark knight and mad max fury road and proves how good a summer tentpoleblockbuster film can be its pretty much perfect
Aug 2 2018,negative,the fact that this is getting good rating only shows how absolutely useless our critics have become
Aug 2 2018,positive,not the best in the series but fallout is yet another solid entry in a franchise that has only churned out one turd mi2  containing so much action that it almost bursts this flick only suffers from getting a little too crazy in the end  great summer entertainment tho
Aug 2 2018,positive,thrilling but predictable great stunts throughout
Aug 2 2018,positive,tom cruise is the new buster keaton in mission impossible fallout he finds innovative ways to throw his aging body into ridiculous stunts yes thats really him up there in this film hes not just the actor tom cruise hes tom cruise the human whirlwind watch tom run jump and run again watch him convincingly fight men a fraction of his age some of whom notably henry cavill are a lot taller than he is cruise deserves credit for bringing humanity to a role that is really just glue for a bunch of x games events with a spy theme the set pieces are outstanding the supporting cast is good the plot recycles themes from other spy movies but were never given time to think about it before the film manically rushes to the next set piece thats ok we watch as bodies cars and trucks fly through the air with the greatest of ease while our heroes sustain only bruises and cuts mission impossible fallout is breathless entertainment tom cruise and his cronies are all in spending a summers afternoon watching the x games hosted by the human fountain of youth isnt a bad way to spend a few hours just check your brain at the door
Aug 2 2018,positive,good fun action packed enjoyed the film
Aug 2 2018,positive,a lot of work went into this one  hope no one got hurt what a roller coaster
Aug 2 2018,positive,awesome second half and ending is movie porn lol love the locations also
Aug 2 2018,positive,it was lit non stop action gg tom cruise
Aug 2 2018,positive,mission impossible returns this year with another mission that may be impossible for anyone else but not for tom cruise because that man can run like hes sponsored by nike after the success that was mission impossible rogue nation 2015 having christopher mcquarrie return for fallout was the right way to go and he shows that he has his finger on the pulse of this franchise just when you thought the action couldnt get any crazier mcquarrie uses his ability to gradually build suspense over time keep you locked in this story takes place following a mission that goes wrong which leaves the imf to race against the clock and put a stop to the threat once it kicks into gear its fun fast paced and brings everything you expect from a mission impossible film to the table you get the charismatic and ever so likeable ensemble big action setpieces plotturning twists and ethan hunt running harder than hes ever run before        the cast this time around is a great one packed with big names both new to the game and returning tom cruise as far as im concerned is ethan hunt he can be in any number of action franchises but this the one character i feel like he nails every time he really is a true movie star as his onscreen charisma sells you completely on all of these stunts which in reality wouldnt be nearly as successful his tightknit crew returns in the form of simon pegg and ving rhames who share a number of great onscreen moments with cruise and have their fair share of light comedic moments here and there rebecca ferguson also returns in an interesting role with an intriguing arc which keeps her around and very much in the thick of the action on the villains side of things sean harris is back as solomon lane hes such an absolute joy to watch as a villain and plays the role very well the major newcomer is henry cavill who is sporting his justice leaguekilling moustache whilst getting in on a number of action sequences it can be hard at times to see him as someone other than superman but he plays the role well here and keeps your mind off that         as for the progression of the story i will say it isnt quite as fast paced and right into the action in the beginning as i thought itd be but it doesnt take its time either mcquarrie cleverly builds suspense with each successive sequence to where i found myself enjoying this movie more and more as it went on in some aspects you could see where things were heading but for the majority of the story i had fun trying to figure out what tricks hunt is going to pull off to get out of his many tough situations it oddly felt like a wholly original experience within the shell of a story that im sure youve seen a number of times there are these elements within the mission impossible franchise from the music to the ethan hunt character and the way it approaches spythriller action that make each one feel unique even though its just a race against the clock story with some twists and turns here and there as i mentioned it does take its time to ease you into the story and give people a bit of a refresher on what has happened in the franchise so far so you really dont need to have seen any of the previous entries to follow this story i was a little lukewarm on the film in the first act but seeing how it all builds towards a strong finale its worth the journey         the action takes centrestage once again and seeing how its going to oneup itself every time is part of the fun cruise was strapped to a plane in rogue nation but somehow he manages to up the stakes again this time around  not only are the stunts and action sequences bigger but there are much more of them to fill the runtime with each consecutive one it upped the stakes significantly and kept the story moving at a quick pace not letting it meander around on some slower moments the fight sequences chase scenes car scenes helicopter scenes theyre all immensely fun to watch and capture what it is to be a mission impossible movie when the iconic theme kicks in at some key moments it never fails to get you pumped and ready for the action mcquarrie has created another gem in this spythriller franchise and i honestly just want him to keep going maybe hire a stuntdouble for cruise next time so he doesnt kill himself though         so with that we say goodbye to another mission impossible film and a great one at that its one of those rare franchises that seems to have found its tone its niche and just finds ways to keep pumping out great thrill rides the nonstop action will keep you invested and going along with a crew of great characters and actors makes the whole thing that much more enjoyable theres rarely a dull moment as it builds in intensity as it progresses towards a finale that caps it all off to a tee fans of the franchise know what theyre getting into and newcomers can also enjoy this entry without any prior knowledge of the 5 films that came before it     8110
Aug 2 2018,positive,lots of fabulous chases and special effects but not as many white knuckle team hijinks as previous movies i missed the humor of the other mi movies but enjoyed seeing previous story lines clarified mission impossible never disappoints
Aug 2 2018,positive,im sad because ill never get to watch this movie for the first time again
Aug 2 2018,positive,absolutely an amazing movie
Aug 2 2018,positive,typically action packed with a few good twists
Aug 2 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is the best action movie of the new century do you need to know anything else
Aug 2 2018,positive,i love james bond batman whatever dom letty and their crew are up to these days what marvel has done rivals zeus and his olympians but mission impossible  fallout just put them all on notice with a paternal pat on the head everything theyre doing is cartoon cute this is now the preeminent action franchise everyone else is just smashing action figures together in a sandbox
Aug 2 2018,positive,excellent cruise is timeless lots of twists and turns 
Aug 2 2018,positive,extremely good movie with cruize at his best
Aug 2 2018,positive,this film was what you expect from the franchise nonstop and a mad plot its not cerebral of course but if you love action films go and see this you wont be thinking about anything else for the running time
Aug 2 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is everything you want from a modern blockbuster and more tom cruise is as great as always he is also absolutely insane with the stunts he does henry cavill is a nice addition to the franchise and series regulars rebecca ferguson simon pegg and ving rhames also shine as well the action scenes are astonishing director christopher mcquarrie delivers some of the most memorable scenes ive seen in a while the plot is also great it keeps you on the edge of your seat for its entire runtime overall this is a phenomenal blockbuster that delivers on every front this is my favorite of the series and i cant wait to see how cruise will try to top himself in the next film 
Aug 2 2018,positive,wow  what a thrill ride first i was disappointed because i did not see the necessity of 3d a first for the series but wait for the motorbike stunts in paris and you will definitely  appreciate the experience and after that it gets better and better well done cant see how they could top it with part 7 cant see tom cruise doing this stunt struggle in a few years
Aug 2 2018,positive,the mission impossible movies just keep getting better
Aug 2 2018,positive,visually striking action though the plot is predictable the movie remains thrilling and exciting from start to finish
Aug 2 2018,positive,tom cruise makes everything look simple alot of alot
Aug 2 2018,positive,best one yet usually i dont like long movies but when its this good im fine with it
Aug 2 2018,neutral,i love this franchise too much and i got overly excited for this movie i guess
Aug 2 2018,positive,what would you expect from mission impossible perhaps a bomb diffused with 1 second to go maybe hanging from a cliff a nuclear bomb well guess whatpredictable 
Aug 2 2018,positive,loved it tons of action twists and surprises see it on the big screen 
Aug 2 2018,positive,edge of my seat the whole movie
Aug 2 2018,positive,super fun with tons of action my husband and i took our 9 year old son and 21 year old daughter and we all loved the movie 
Aug 1 2018,positive,script was whatever stunts were legit action was extreme a few parts got the heart pumping and had me grasping at the armrests of my chair kickass summer blockbuster
Aug 1 2018,positive,horrible acting endlessly entertaining inventive and downright fun to watch though
Aug 1 2018,positive,the last movie star    if one were to write a biography of tom cruise that would have to be the title over the past several decades hollywood has come to rely less and less on the draw of large personalities most blockbusters are now marketed with spectacle and imagery not names above the title yet cruise remains like a dogged survivor in one of his films hes living history stalking the tall grass of change continually proving his own industry wrong    and if mission impossible  fallout is any indication he has no intention of slowing down not only is the movie the most actionpacked of the series it may also be the best mind this doesnt mean its a masterpiece the bar hasnt been set especially high when it comes to depth and intelligence but if you enjoy the franchise particularly the last two entries it would be a true chore to dislike this one    the plotalways secondary in these films always a bit too complicated for its own goodbegins in belfast there imf agent ethan hunt cruise learns of a splinter group of assassins who call themselves the apostles and have essentially become terroristsforhire theyre trying to get their hands on a trio of recentlystolen plutonium cores you can guess the reason also involved are an anarchist named john lark and the previous films villain solomon lane sean harris    after a botched exchange in berlin in which the plutonium is lost hunt and his team simon pegg ving rhames are tasked by imf secretary alan hunley alec baldwin with recovering the cores through a meeting in paris between lark and a blackmarket broker known as the white widow vanessa kirby still with me suffice to say aborted directives doublecrosses and general chaos follow the key players from europe all the way to the edge of the himalayas where hunts past finally catches up with him    one thing i greatly admire in movies is ambition as evidenced by the story fallout holds nothing back whether or not it covers the most geographic ground in the franchise it plays like the biggest entry whereas past missions were stopgaps this is a culmination stakes rise secrets are revealed lives change    at least on screen oh that such emotions extended to the audience but for the most part that effect has been absent from mis mo for quite some time not since the third movie did the narrative forsake its glossy stuntriddled surface to mine genuine feeling and mi3 made the least amount of money in the franchise so its understandable that such a personal direction would be rerouted     but without it mission impossibleand fallout specificallyis destined to be the prettiest belle at a secondrate ball for all its globetrotting its only a partial experience we see alland are amazedbut feel little and remember less each character is more caricature than human being trading the details of life for the whims of a streamlined script like marvel or the fast and the furious fallout doesnt present reality it paraphrases it    some may call this nitpicking and they wouldnt be far off but the bar must be raised when it comes to depth because its already been surpassed in nearly every other aspect visually fallout is a ball of frenetic joy a feast for the eyes the scenery is always changing we can imagine the cameras struggling to keep up with such a rapidly unfolding plot     that plot though can be its own worst enemy there are only so many twists a story can stand before each one starts to mean a little less    thankfully other factors maintain our attention lorne balfes score adds some taught variation to lalo schifrins classic theme and while each member of the cast does fine henry caville stands out as a mysterious cia officer the role fits him better than supermans tights    but in the end it all comes back to cruise hes the reason we watch and his relentless energy fuels the entire franchise fallout runs hunt through the requisite gauntlet of stunts hanging from a helicopter above mountainous terrain speeding through the packed streets of paris on a motorcycle skydiving from thirtythousand feet     but more than deathdefying acrobatics is the quality they signify devotion when an actor who has nothing left to prove consistently gives everything hes got admiration is easy     in case you were curious imf stands for impossible missions force
Aug 1 2018,positive,not my favorite cruises action movie the favorite was the great the edge of tomorrow but still manages to excite and thrill action scenes often look over the top and this part i liked the least about the movie they could have kept it more believable hence making it more enjoyable at least for me the movie seems to be impeccably shot and directed but i guess id exchange the thrills for more brutality and honesty but that will make it a different kind of movie perhaps
Aug 1 2018,positive,a great followup to rogue nation make sure to see that before watching this loved it
Aug 1 2018,positive,what an amazing film its 25 hours of pure adrenaline
Aug 1 2018,positive,this is one of the best films ive seen all year

Aug 1 2018,positive,heart pounding fast pace this latest installment had me chewing my fingernails into nothing action set pieces that are astounding and crazy its a thrill ride from start to finish 
Aug 1 2018,positive,the fast paced action and suspense will have you leaning forward in your seat tom cruise continues to make excellent mission impossible movies the final battle was in my opinion one of the most fun and exciting final scenes of any action movie
Aug 1 2018,positive,incredibly fun and actionpacked if you not on the edge of your seat its only because the twists and turns have thrown you to the back of it
Aug 1 2018,positive,ok so if you like action flicks that you dont want to think about this is your movie props to tom cruise because the insane things he puts himself through is nothing short of amazing storywise its pretty tacky horrible how do these people not know they are being baited is beyond me and cavil   lets just thank god he has a slamming body cuz he aint winning any acting awards soon and cavil shave that damn moustache off it wasnt worth all that cg to cover it 75 outta 10 7 just for cavils gun show pose during the restroom scene
Aug 1 2018,positive,the mission franchise is an interesting one  its spanned over 20 years has only had two actors appear in every film has never fully embraced continuity and has undoubtedly gone through many production issues  alas its also one of the greatest franchises because it has defied what it means to impress audience with action and it keeps getting better and better with every film  although admittedly im not exactly sure how it can get any better from here  i saw this movie early and instantly felt it was one of the best action movies of all time but i also knew i needed to see it at least one more time before i really did give it that title  well ive seen the film 4 times now and each time further cemented my feelings everything from the halo jump to the middle act which is essentially one long chase sequence to the callbacks to the helicopter scene to henry cavills unnecessary but totally bada facial hair  mission impossible fallout is an unbelievable ride that simply never lets up  even in its quiet moments it has touching dialogue that makes the action more weighted  even in my 4 viewings ive never been bored and i cant wait to see it again  it also surprisingly had a great amount of emotional stakes something the serious didnt really have since mission 3  there are a few moments with ving rhames rebecca ferguson and michelle monaghan that really hit me emotionally and i never would have expected that from this series  it has the best antagonists since phillip seymour hoffman and maybe even better the action is easily the most impressive in years probably since fury road and the actors have never been better   if theres going to be another one then take your time and do it right because this could very well be the best conclusion possible for the series  thank you to tom cruise and christopher mcquarrie for making this an instant classic     1010
Aug 1 2018,positive,lovelovelove the movie
Aug 1 2018,neutral,meh as far as action films go its alright as far as the mi series goes its alright
Aug 1 2018,positive,an action pack moviethis movies has it all from action to plot twist this movie is not only the out of the series but one of the best movies of 2018 so far
Aug 1 2018,positive,wowjust wow best motorcycle chase scene e v e r 
Aug 1 2018,positive,i really enjoyed every minute of this movie tom cruise delivered as usual
Aug 1 2018,positive,so amazing tom cruise deserves all the praise and kudos for keeping his role as ethan hunt entertaining and relevant he clearly is the hardest working actor in the businesshis stunts were really next to impossible i loved watching ving rhames get some meatier acting time compared to other mission movies rebecca ferguson is now my forever ultimate femme hero and her chemistry with cruise was hot hot hot henry cavill proved to be a worthy adversary to cruise and vanessa kirby made her stand as an up and coming actress as well im hoping angela basset who is such a bad a  be given the role as the new imf boss simon pegg had me worried there for a minute but thankfully it all worked out bottom lineim ready for the next one
Aug 1 2018,positive,best mission yet  no doubt this will inspire another  go see it once and youll go again
Aug 1 2018,positive,it was better than the other 5
Aug 1 2018,positive,the world needs more movies made like this one 
Aug 1 2018,negative,even judging this on the scale of action films in general both the action sequences and the explanations went on too long yawn never again saw it in imax even
Aug 1 2018,positive,one of the best movies of summer wow
Aug 1 2018,positive,were truly not worthy of such an incredible franchise fallout is the most thrilling farout overthetop out of all the mi movies
Aug 1 2018,positive,fluffy fun saw it in imax and the visuals and sound truly popped the tension was sometimes unbearable in a good way i was happily tricked more than once exciting and tricky thats all i wanted and thats what i got the emo stuff was only slightly corny
Aug 1 2018,positive,one of the most thrilling movies ive seen in a long time
Aug 1 2018,positive,brilliant film fast explosive and the right amount of humour tom cruise doesnt seem to age the plot was a little thin however the special effects and acting made up for this minor detail
Aug 1 2018,positive,i dont do this much but i felt the need to  my money was more than worth the viewing i love action action films take to another place and make you feel risky and excited mi fallout blew me away and took the candles with it what a film  tom c is a master at the art of making you sit on the edge and its not fuckin stop i say it again non fucking stop  story action camera anglesit kept every scene in your focus and i honestly  feel like i watched it all nothing to over complicated but kept the scene in not to long says tom on to the next annnnd action start againsolomon lane oh jesus u just wanna kill that man  get him ethan and henry mr superman to go from the man of steel to a role that makes you think the role is a personal vendetta wow  i now want to sit and watch them all again wow   wow  wow well done tom now for the next dark universe  guys go see it you wont be dissapointed
Aug 1 2018,positive,if it could lose 20mins of excess and sometimes bad dialogue this could easily the best in the series
Aug 1 2018,positive,so likethis was pretty much my first time seeing a mission impossible movie which is kinda crazy cause i have always been a huge fan of the spy drama since i was a little kidso much that it is very strange when i find a spy franchise like this that has been around for so long but heyits fun not going to lie there     the biggest positive i can see on this movie was the action is freaking amazing every scene feels truly brutal and powerful i love movies with this very brutal action scenes that feel very much like john wick or winter solder every punch given feels harder and it makes the stakes feel higher than they are and tom cruise only adds to that with his action also not being perfect he isnt the perfect fighter in the film there are scenes where he falls and gets hurt and you feel that moments of just real intensity that just blow you away    henry cavil also plays a great yang to tom cruise as his really ramps up every scene he is in and heck even steals the show at certain points and i absolutely love thathe pulls off every scene he is in with great flare and a mustache to boot to go along with it was the mustache needed i dont really think so but it was a great add on anyway     the movies greatest weakness is its execution of its twist the twist really feel forced and unneeded at times for me more to give a big gasp over anything else im not going to give away the twist here but there is a scene or rather a collection of scenes back to back when we get one twist after the other and it feels really dragging     overall though mission impossible is a fun time at the theater and one id highly recommend
Aug 1 2018,positive, love tom cruise and henry cavill and the rest of the cast i loved everything huge fan
Aug 1 2018,positive,i couldnt notice a green screen and thats a good thing
Aug 1 2018,positive,chase scenes took up the whole movie need more substance

Aug 1 2018,positive,best action movie this year
Aug 1 2018,positive,amazing movie  you have to see this in imax
Aug 1 2018,positive,this movie makes a good case for the mission impossible series better than the bond series 007 will always make a better gq article and has more iconic tropes but the mi movies create much better scenarios i can see them one day someone taking over for tom cruze and this franchise keep going
Aug 1 2018,positive,definitely recommend watching this film i was on the edge of my seat
Aug 1 2018,positive,wowno really wow  well done all round
Aug 1 2018,positive,yeah its another mission impossible movie good action but doesnt stand out among the rest of the franchise
Aug 1 2018,negative,little tommy cruise sucks hugeas usual 
Aug 1 2018,positive,near perfect they went back to their roots no not the first movie  the mr phelps roots real blending of the old school storytelling and new action well blended with a fairly easy to follow plot there is no real villain in this movie but there are good twists you figure out the plot pretty early on but you dont care ethan hunte will save the day but again you know that youre just along for the ride its a fun movie someone asked how long does tom cruise have before he retires man never he will never retire   hes a robot i am convinced  this is how you subvert your expectations in a sequel
Aug 1 2018,positive,sleek wins the race against time big time
Aug 1 2018,positive,great movie never found myself bored and the action was amazing 
Aug 1 2018,positive,not only is this the best in the series i feel it dethrones a lot of my alltime favorite action movies

Aug 1 2018,positive,by far the best in the series to date henry cavill makes an amazing addition to the series just when you think they cant up the game another in the series comes out and they show you they can
Aug 1 2018,positive,fast paced action to the max  fresh action sequences kudos to the director cinematographer stunts etc no bathroom breaks for me when i watched this on a theater this is the 2nd movie aside from the first in the franchise that lured me to a theater what an experience kudos to all who made this motion picture

Aug 1 2018,positive,this really may be the best in the enitre series the movie never drags i need to see more mi movies directed by mcquarrie with cruise now    probably my favorite movie of 2018
Aug 1 2018,positive,what a fuckin ride
Aug 1 2018,positive,a terrific action movie of the year the only flaw was the lack of unexpected hightech as what prequels unveiled
Aug 1 2018,positive,thrill ride from the moment it starts to the credits  one of the best in the serieshope they bring jeremy renner s character back  excellent nods and story line connects from previous films  truly enjoyed it
Aug 1 2018,positive, action 
Aug 1 2018,positive,awesome and action packed from start to finish had major anxiety during a few scenes but a very entertaining movie for sure well done
Aug 1 2018,positive,wow fallout takes mission impossible to a whole new arthouse level i rarely see in action blockbusters the action is absoluately insane and the plot is wonderfully twisty in all the right ways however it doesnt compromise its character depth humor or emotional draw not one bit of it all of that just elevates this mission to excruciatingly intense heights with a cinematic adrenaline rush i havent felt in years this is not only the best of this summer and finest of the franchise but one of the best action moviesever
Aug 1 2018,positive,about 40 minutes too long need to cut chase time
Aug 1 2018,positive,i choose to accept it  my review of mission impossible fallout 4 stars    wow  wait 5 seconds  wow  wait another 5 seconds wow  yep that about sums up the experience of watching mission impossible fallout the incredibly entertaining endlessly thrilling new entry in the beloved movie franchise which started with the bar pretty high when brian de palma directed the first and has continued along with quite good results  christopher mcquarrie who directed the last installment continues here and while not exactly making a film for the ages he has produced a whopping feat in action cinema  this is one starttofinish set piece extravaganza and a shining example of studio blockbuster entertainment made right  tom cruise returns as imf agent ethan hunt and this time he and his cohorts need to thwart the sale of plutonium before it gets in the wrong hands and destroys the planet  yep its that simple and the streamlined plot expertly laid out makes it easier to ride along from one crazy sequence after another  its a terrific setup i love that mcquarrie has chosen not to update the old school reeltoreel tape spelling out hunts mission  theres a fizzy feeling when the tape selfdestructs leaving a trail of smoke as it always has and as it always should be  as ethan and his teammates simon pegg and ving rhames avoid mortal danger in the opening scenes a wonderfully pulpy clever twists sends us off to a blazing title sequence all of which caused the audience i was in to applaud a couple of timesbut this movie is just getting started  enter cia honcho played by angela bassett who doesnt trust ethan et al to get the goods so she assigns her own strongman august walker to shadow them hes played by henry cavill and if he werent a star already this film would turn him into one  he may not deliver his expository lines with a masters touch  in fact hes pretty wooden at times but overall this is a fantastic iconic performance  whether hes skydiving with cruise or taking part in one of the most thrilling bathroom fight sequences ive seen on a par with eastern promises orwell there are so many just go and see for yourself  cavill is all moustache tight suits and hulking action moves as he towers over cruise and makes a true mark in the film  cavill brings out a great competitive spirit in cruise giving their scenes a sparksome may categorize that spark as the most homoerotic men fighting type since ken russells women in loveor they just punch and growl at each other a lot  you figure it out    also on hand to make things pop is rebecca ferguson as hunts allyenemy ilsa faust  shes so good and its such a relief to see her shine again after the dismal snowman from earlier this year  mvp honors however go to vanessa kirby as white widow a spooky negotiator who floats in and out of the film with an alien air of mystery  shes weird in a tilda swinton meets lady gaga way and the film benefits from all that is her    but of course these films live or die because of tom cruise  as he gets older he has eschewed so much of his all american boy spirit replacing it with a tired worldweariness which works wonders when youre faced with certain nuclear destruction  knowing that he likes to do as many of his own stunts as possible seems to work wonders when enjoying these scenes in this film he skydives rides a motorcycle through paris runs thrillingly across rooftops flies a helicopter and dangles from a lot of ropes whether theyre hanging from said copter or from the side of a steep cliff and we as an audience applaud hisi dont knowinsane willingness to die for us  i guess thats what it is  tom cruise wants to die for our sins  whatever the case this is a performance to be treasured for its laserfocused commitment to action  sure its not perfect  theres one scene im calling exposition for dummies because the characters tell us whats happening and just in case we missed it they say it all over again  its an odd moment reeking of studio notes to make sure everything is crystal clear  also michele monaghan once again gets straddled with a nothing role and folks shes a great great actor  can somebody please use her well asap    but pretty much everything else about this film works phenomenally  mcquarrie knows just where to put the camera turning even a simple early moment of a car pulling up into a swooping swirling thrill  mcquarrie also truly understands suspense and the joy of wellearned reveals and clever callbacks  its still a thrill when people tear away rubber masks in these movies  i walked away from mission impossible fallout really clever title btw simultaneously exhausted and satisfied which is clearly mcquarrie cruise and companys mission
Aug 1 2018,positive,this film proves why cruise is such an enduring star  thrilling nonstop action
Aug 1 2018,positive,awsome tom is living legend
Aug 1 2018,positive,finished watching mission impossible fallouthave to say at 56 years old tom cruise still does some of the most amazing stunts on film non stop action had me at the edge of my seat best of the series henry cavill and the rest of the cast are great as well highly recommend this movie
Aug 1 2018,positive,a nonstop thrill ride there were some plot inconsistencies but the action cinematography music and sets made up more than enough for that a dang good movie
Aug 1 2018,positive,the best in the franchise and  the best action movie in 2018 so far 
Aug 1 2018,positive,the hype is real  so resuming where the last movie left off ethan hunt tom cruise and his team are still picking up the pieces of a mission gone wrong  seems like the criminal organization known as the syndicate has now become the apostles and they are bent on obtaining plutonium so as to construct bombs for nefarious purposes  will imf be able to save the day  now i wasnt actually sold by the trailers of this  its not that they looked bad it just didnt look like anything that wasnt already covered in rogue nation which was simply a decent film  i was going to skip it or at the very least wait until home release that is until the rave reviews started to pour in  a 97 fresh rating on rottentomatoes is enough for me to take any film seriously and let me go ahead and cut the tension this does not disappoint  now if this ended up being as good as ghost protocol i was going to walk out of the theater a happy camper  while i personally prefer the fourth film fallout is not a movie to be trifled with  this is a story that doesnt really ever let up as far as the action goes  as soon as the opening credits stop it keeps moving from rewarding set piece to rewarding set piece  every action sequence in this has payoff and i will go out on a limb and say that you are not going to see better choreographed action all summer  it is refreshing because there is a lack of cgi in this  when given the choice director christopher mcquarrie chooses actually doing the stunt instead of covering it up in post production at least 95 of the time if not more  this especially puts you in the moment when there is gigantic spectacle happening all around and to be frank thats exactly what i watch blockbusters for  i caught myself holding my breath at a number of different points in this and the action is shot about as well as it can be filmed  the locations are exotic and terrific and tom cruise shows no sign of slowing down despite being over five and a half decades old  everything is tied together by an amazing score and while it wasnt composed by hans zimmer it gave me dark knight vibes like whoa  i prefer ghost protocol because it is more of a fun wow and this is more of a serious wow  it really boils down to what your personal preference is but this is something you should still see on as big of a screen as possible
Aug 1 2018,positive,benji why should i be one here panic    luthur youve always wanted to be on the field giggles    benji yeah but not in a situation like this    ethan benjirelax i wont let them harm you smiles    yeah the dialogues by ethan hunt tom cruise says it all the reason why hes always rouge is to protect his friends and loved ones and not to mention the entire life force the same charisma applies to the latest franchise unlike any other mission impossible movies in fallout ethen hunt shows his compassion to other beings how he respects an innocent sole just like the dragon ball character gokuhunt shows his naive part by sparing the lifes of yeah even his enemies like solomon lane    naive part of goku and ethan hunt  ok now to the main part about the movie well the movie begins from where rouge nation ends after the syndicate got neutralized a lot of people linked to it where caught or killed where as there were still somethe apostlesa terrorist group whos real identities were unknown and they plans to have some massive destruction and terror by using an element called plutonium ethans mission is to get that plutonium in safe hands of the cia well thats about it i aint gonna reveal the whole story to give some spoilers so that i could destroy the whole mood of yours jeez i am not that evil so lets get to the part where i say about the technical directional and other stuffs about the movie shall we    the positivess    the stunts what about the stunts what about it for gods sake were talking about tom cruise here thats right the stunts are undoubtedly the best not just in the whole career of tom cruise but may be one of the greatest stunts ever in the history of cinema the stunts alone will make you happy for the money youve spent on that ticket youve brought    tom cruise helicopter stunt in fallout  the plot the plot of the movie is well written and well directed thanks to the directorscript writer christopher mcquarrie who did his once academy award winning magicmcquarrie won the academy award for best original screenplay for the usual suspects    technologically the movies on top level you will find the camera angles and the vfx mind blowing before you go just checkout some shots at nolan movies like the dark knight youre gonna love mission impossiblefallouts visuals well of course christopher nolans on anoter level but so do christopher mcquarrie    the cast well the cast ha no word tom cruisehenry cavillving rhamessimon peggrebecca ferguson michelle monaghanangela bassettalec baldwinetc are perfectly aligned it was a good call casting the superman against ethan hunt so that the superman realizes its not just batman who can stop him if he goes berserklol and oops cant help it another tiny spoiler it was a good call casting both michelle monaghan and wes bentleyyoull know what i mean when you see the movie got some good sense of humor flowing through the veins between some hardcore actions without effecting the plot    mission impossible fallout cast poster  the list goes on and on    the negatives    sean harriss go less screen presence    sean harriss less screen presence is a negative in mission impossible fallout  why is jeremy renners william brandt not in the movie well we know its because of his hawkeye character hes been playing for the infinity war sequel but hey jeremy youre been missed in the movie    hawkeye over william brandt  cant think of any other negatives    the movie wont make you regret for your money and time go for it without fear go get it tiger    john wick and eathan hunt actions  final verdict one of the best action movies of recent times especially when you consider the plot mission impossible  fallout falls under the best category of action with good plot just like john wick chapter 2 or may be even better since it got some humor too i will give it a 455    visit  to read my review properly
Aug 1 2018,positive,endings kind of make it ordinary much like the rest of the franchise
Aug 1 2018,negative,the worst most clichefilled antiquated movie ive seen in a long time we actually laughed out loud at the ridiculousness korniness and shear lack of originality
Aug 1 2018,positive,the action sequences were amazing the plot was good the cinematography was great this was probably the best mi movie of them all
Aug 1 2018,positive,very action packed  loved it
Aug 1 2018,positive,nothing original just more of everything 
Aug 1 2018,positive,another great mission in possible movie wow
Aug 1 2018,positive,a worthy installment for this franchise but i do not think it lived up to the hype the movie has tons of action and it is all well done but it had too many little plot twists that have been done so many times before also the funny banter usually found with the imf team fell flat i could tell they were trying to be funny but it just did not work the actors who make up the imf team are starting to show their age and i sincerely hope this will be the last installment of this franchise go out on a high note
Aug 1 2018,positive,rogue nation was better this was entertaining though the helicopter scene is amazing 
Aug 1 2018,positive,best mission impossible yet dont know how you top
Aug 1 2018,positive,freaking awesome the best in the franchise so far no stop action and thrills second half of the movie i swear i had sweaty palms
Aug 1 2018,positive,utterly ridiculous unrealistic storyline that makes mission impossible what it is insane stunts incredible action and my favorite movie of 2018 
Aug 1 2018,positive,loved it tom cruise makes everything great great action great tension intense plot would highly recommend
Aug 1 2018,positive,decent action movie loved the motorcycle chase scene and the helicopter scenes but a predictable end
Aug 1 2018,positive,wow this is a colossus of a movie the astounding wowfactor of the stunts will make your jaw drop some of the dialogue doesnt live up to the standard of the stunts and this isnt as complex a movie as some of the earlier films but i still think its the best entry into the mi series
Aug 1 2018,positive,enjoy this movie for simply what it is its a fast and fun joyride that keeps you interested from beginning to end its not an overly complicated story line and thats fine because it allows you to just enjoy the show the best of the mi movies for sure 
Aug 1 2018,positive,this just might be my favorite movie of the year what a blast 
Aug 1 2018,positive,action packed from start to finish amazing movieprobably the best of the series must see 
Aug 1 2018,positive,everything you want from a mission impossible movie is present and accounted for in this sixth instalment of tom cruises teflon franchise the mcguffin plot chock full of double and triple crosses visceral and punishing handtohand combat chase sequences in the air by car motorbikes and even helicopters the trademark tom cruise running here extended for your viewing pleasure the return of old favourites like simon peggs benji and rebecca fegursons isla faust and the introduction of new ones like vanessa kirbys fun but underused white widow which has great potential for the next film and of course the impossibly elaborate and audacious mission which will always be figured out by the imf team headed by cruises ethan hunt however the real mission impossible is how cruise and returning writerdirector christopher mcquarrie manages to avoid staleness and repetition in an ageing franchise and not only manage to mount a series of spectacular and expectationsdefying action sequences but also makes the normally contrived if not implausible action narrative that link it all together feels relevant and believable smaller scenes in between the explosive and daring sequences and expositions actually delivers humour sophistication and class even unexpectedly with a half decent script and excellent pacing i was totally gripped and exhausted by the end of the tensionfilled 2hrs experience which left me gasping on the edge of my seat and quite happy to forgive minor sins such as henry cavills obviously written character with that infamous moustache and the almost superpowers some characters possess to be exactly at the right place at the right time either by coincidence or design meticulously and brilliantly executed this is already frontrunner for action movie of 2018 and contender for best of the series and could in time surpass my fondness for mi3 one day
Aug 1 2018,negative,henry cavill died movie was pretty good until my bae henry died so 0 out of 5 stars sorry
Aug 1 2018,positive,i couldnt have been happier with missionfilm  it made fastfurious seem slow  delirious 1010 batmanvsuperman had nothing on huntvsuperman   henry cavill is on fkn fire alec baldwin slayed and angela bassett is a great addition to the franchise too  it really was the avengers infinity war of mission impossible films all the previous movies seemed to build up to and be tied into this one   the stunts the characters and villains so much action   seriously henry cavill is such an amazing an captivating screen presence if he was up against anyone but tom cruises ethan hunt the other actor would be completely overshadowed by henrys macho charisma cant wait to see him in the next superman movie   i havent bothered with the last couple of bournes and bonds on the big screen as they seem to be getting worse over time but mission impossible seems fresher and crazier now than 20 years ago and fallout is literally film school on how to do a spyactionblockbuster movie right
Aug 1 2018,positive,mission impossible may never be as sexy as 007 but the story telling and action have surpassed the british counterpart 
Aug 1 2018,positive,great movie lots of action and suspense tom cruise never disappoints
Aug 1 2018,positive,simply amazing and almost flawless this has incredible action and effects with great turning points throughout negativepacing off just a tiny bit
Aug 1 2018,positive,for me the best in the franchise and perhaps the best action film hollywood has ever produced so far visual editing and stunts are topnotch i really admire the application of realistic scenes and the minimal use of cgi effects on action sequences all scenes are mindblowing and have truly kept me at the edge of my seats since the beginning tom cruise delivered his best on this one totally worthwatching all over again
Aug 1 2018,positive,not a fan of this one this is one instance where the trailer makes it look more interesting than it really is
Jul 31 2018,positive,best of the series the action scenes are incredible
Jul 31 2018,positive,solid actionadventure film with an emphasis on action rather than plausible storytelling turn your brain off and enjoy 
Jul 31 2018,positive,the best of the series wow what a ride once again a sequel so see rogue nation first cruise has this franchise locked up i will be seeing it again 
Jul 31 2018,positive,bam this movie will zap you out of your senses nail biting and exhilarating it will get your heart racing  you can skip 2 days of cardio this has got to be the best damn action movie in a long time after watching superhero movies all year nonstop thanks moviepass it was good while it lasted it was refreshing to see people actually running instead of flying or actually punch someone instead of throwing a truck at them if you remotely like action movies you have to see this hand to hand combat car chase bike chase gunfights bombs helicopter chase suspense mystery  this has it all  tom cruise henry cavill  rebecca ferguson are mindblowing forget all the previous mi movies just go watch this one
Jul 31 2018,positive,amazingly great so much so that you dont realize how long it actually is 
Jul 31 2018,positive,great action overall great movie
Jul 31 2018,positive,fallout achieves what almost every action movie would like to do these days tell a twisting and engaging story that makes sense and challenges the heroes while the technical aspect of production exceeds its contemporaries the sound design in this   film alone should be a standard for hollywood
Jul 31 2018,positive,really just an overall entertaining movie
Jul 31 2018,positive,a good but very predictable scenario the realization and the beauty of the scenes save this film full of errors from the scientific error to the cgi visible as the nose in the middle of the face
Jul 31 2018,positive,let me sum up the effort put into the movie the film had three thousand scene setups thirteen helicopters six pregnancies five hiatuses four weeks of aerial photography three continents a year of training for cruise to do the halo jump two winters and one broken ankle the effort mr cruise and co put into mission impossible fallout will payout tenfold it is already on track to be the highest rating and highest grossing mission impossible movie and the good news from this is that they will be making more action movies of recent years have become fatiguing we have seen it all been impressed as much as we could but mission impossible fallout laughs in the face of common place and donebefore it just throws its star out of anything moving and hopes he survives who doesnt love that  full review is now up on salty popcorn
Jul 31 2018,positive,great movie non stop action must see
Jul 31 2018,positive,if you love action sequences stitched end to end in cliche of anytime for my friend this is ethan hunting
Jul 31 2018,positive,interesting plot lines as usual good character examination of ethan hunt as well as his motivations threatening villains and good supporting cast luther provided some unintentional comic relief through his bold and impractical fashion choices as well as impracticality in any action sequence not as extreme stunts however the hand to hand combat was top notch 
Jul 31 2018,positive,what a movie    cruise at his best
Jul 31 2018,positive,great movie but they either cut a few scenes that are shown in the trailers or were intentionally misleading us  not a fan of that  but if the trailer is my biggest complaint then i think thats probably a good thing
Jul 31 2018,positive,i attended the friday opening in phoenix in 2d i enjoyed the hell out out of it so much so i knew id be seeing it again this 2nd time i decided to enjoy the 3d version at my favorite theater holy crap if ever there was a movie made for 3d this was it as good as it was it was easily 50 better in 3d what an amazing and superior action flick in every way possiblealso i dont care what tom cruises birth certificate says theres no way in hell hes 50no way
Jul 31 2018,positive,great film all around actionpacked and awesome stunt scenes  tom cruise doed it again
Jul 31 2018,positive,vanessa kirby shines  mi fallout is a masterpiece top to bottom about 25 minutes too long but well worth the wait
Jul 31 2018,positive,action packed adrenaline rushing madness loved every second
Jul 31 2018,positive,it makes my life seem so    boring
Jul 31 2018,positive,this movie greatly surprised me and truly excited my expectations its full of great action excellent story telling and character development the action was very dramatic and made you excited and intrigued to see what happened next by the end of the movie i was at the edge of my seat waiting for the dramatic outcome it truly is a great movie to watch and one of tom cruises best works yet
Jul 31 2018,positive,one of the best action 3d action movies i have ever seen a must see for sure
Jul 31 2018,positive,breathtaking stunts and fights as expected totally generic and forgettable story i hate it when the team is more like ethan hunt and his sidekicks i wish the ladies were styled differently because i honestly thought the two women were the same person especially in the trailers typing of the trailers there are at least two stunts in the trailers that are not in the theatrical release
Jul 31 2018,positive,best mission impossible
Jul 31 2018,positive,awesome action fun  funny
Jul 31 2018,positive,amazed at how a franchise can get better after 6 films this is by far the best mission impossible 
Jul 31 2018,positive,everything youd want in an action flick is here its like if you wrote an action movie fanfic with the characters of mission impossibleand the director christopher mcquarrie actually read it and made it a movie the choreography was on point so many twists and turns and by the end credits you feel tired as well what an awesome movie no complaints here
Jul 31 2018,positive,awesome great non stop action a must watch after watching the prior film to understand who comes into play of actors sequel 
Jul 31 2018,negative,its like watching tom cruise masterbating his own huge veiny ego for 2 and a half hours gross
Jul 31 2018,positive,wow best mi film yet 
Jul 31 2018,positive,6 movies in 22 years  tom cruise still has the edge and the knack for getting himself in extreme situations  this was 10x better than rogue nation which to be honest failed to keep me invested   with this one theres more insane stunts and they actually manged to wrap up the dangling storylines from previous entries  fallout has ethan having nightmares about losing his wife julia and letting soloman lane go  everything that ethan has feared of losing may actually come to pass when he and his team track down three pieces of plutonium  an anonymous enemy called lark and his team of apostles intend to start the world over again by creating great suffering the greater the loss the greater the peace  new players come in from henry cavill as walker to angela basset as erica to vanessa kirby as the white widow to returning players like alec baldwin rebecca ferguson and even michelle monaghan  this film actually follows more of the spirit of the tv show heck the filmmakers are even selfaware of so many of the elements these films consist of  does it mean the imf is a joke how many times has ethan lost support from his agency how long will it take until hes had enough   a lot of things can fall apart even from a well executed plan like trying to stop these nuclear bombs  exciting action a darker tone thrilling music and way more action its the highest the franchise has ever reached  an overextended climax aside tom cruise as ethan hunt is the most human hes ever been  will there be more movies in the future who knows
Jul 31 2018,positive,the best yet and ive seen them all
Jul 31 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout was fantastic i couldnt get enough of the onscreen dynamic between henry cavill and tom cruise i really need to see henry cavill in more movies hes a phenomenal actor with a huge range i thought he was a fierce enemy for cruises ethan     additionally the movie still had the flows and flavors of the best mission impossible movies it had that adrenaline that carries you through to the end of the film that makes your heart burst through your chest in anticipation go see this movie you wont regret it
Jul 31 2018,positive,fallout is the best mission impossible movie yet this film does a lot right when it comes to action acting and great pacing every event that occurs has more stakes then the last and this movie does not let you regroup until the very end there are also small details that i really liked minor spoiler ahead like during the car chase scene a car tries to get in front of tom cruise to stop his car for the police chasing him this will probably remain the best movie in the series and i give it a 810
Jul 31 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout manages to bigger and better than the previous entries in the series and the result is a high energy intensely thrilling and fast paced action film that is very engaging to watch
Jul 31 2018,positive,the mission impossible films  started good not great  number 2 went ridiculous it was after this the films got a lot more interesting i do worry with a film franchise like this that theyll run out of steam but i neednt have worried about the newest addition as i think it is possibly the best mission film yet great to see the gang back together love the chemistry between them you can tell these guys are friends off camera wandered how henry cavill  would fit into this film but wow what a impact he has and his best performance to date fan of mission impossible or just like a well made action film you must see this
Jul 31 2018,negative,worst script ever  baldwin should be glad he died   same nonsense over and over again
Jul 31 2018,positive,keeping the best quality and action spectacle than any spy action movie this is cruises specialty and signature role the story moved fast and smart predictable but still smart the casting of cavill is brilliant the rest of the cast was great as well ready for the next installment a
Jul 31 2018,positive,best of the series nonstop action but it never becomes too convoluted and repetitive great acting and the best villain since hoffman a summer blockbuster like no other
Jul 31 2018,negative,mission impossible to follow
Jul 31 2018,positive,really enjoyed this  proper edgeoftheseat movie
Jul 31 2018,positive,one the best films ive seen all year
Jul 31 2018,positive,i swear the mission impossible movies get better and better if this was the last onethey went out on a high i truly enjoyed this film and its the epitome of why i go to the movies
Jul 31 2018,positive,it ends just as it begins high energy thats sustained throughout the duration blend that with epic location shots and youve got one of the best films of the decade the weakest link would be cruises unusual subtle performance in character ethan hunt cruises restraint seems to have been a big part of its success all costars really shine with what appears to be effortless skill i cant wait for the blurays behind the scenes go see it  its an adrenaline junkies delight
Jul 31 2018,positive,best mi yet will definitely watch again
Jul 31 2018,positive,not only are the action sequences visually stunning but this installment of the series is backed by a well crafted edgeofyourseat script  full of plot twists and hands down the best stunts ever filmed every minute of this movie entertains  even for those who have not see the previous chapters in the series  do yourself a favor and see it in a dolby cinema or amc prime theater
Jul 31 2018,neutral,this franchise has gone from mission incomprehensible to mission oh so obvious they are really spelling it out in this one and you can figure out the bad guy way before tom does and guys do we really need a motorcycle chase following a motorcycle chase i went from entertained to bored after wayyyyy too many chase scenes my husband enjoyed it more 
Jul 31 2018,positive,amazing stunts but odd storyline
Jul 31 2018,positive,its fine  the action sequence at the end was fantastic  other than that it was fine
Jul 31 2018,positive,the ending was pretty outlandish over the top and unnecessary good movie overall with great action
Jul 31 2018,positive,tom cruise may not be much of an actor in the classical sense but wow can he dazzle with his stunts fallout continues the successful run of the rebooted series and delights in escalating stakes and stunts that get more implausible but more exhilarating as it progresses the film climaxes in a stunning set piece that will have mouths agape and people cheering what is also special about this kind of film is the lack of a cliffhanger ending  in a definite curtain close that suggests this is exactly how this series needed to end it may not be a masterpiece but its gorgeous cinematography clever action sequences and terrific performances mostly from the female cast ensure this series will end on a high note rating 83
Jul 31 2018,positive,great flick would have watched it again if it was an option
Jul 31 2018,positive,great add to the franchise more action and of course more tom cruise
Jul 31 2018,positive,for me 2018 has been a pretty lackluster year at the movies until i saw mission impossible fallout it wasnt just good it was absolutely incredible the cast has great chemistry the story is just right with new and old elements and the action oh god the action was some of the best in cinema you have to see mission impossible fallout right now you wont regret it
Jul 31 2018,positive,best action movie till date
Jul 31 2018,positive,this film cements mission impossible as perhaps the greatest action franchise of this generation
Jul 31 2018,negative,terrible predictiacble boring and repetitive i had to force my self to sit through this movie the plot line is absolute garbage they use all apart of the plan way to much to bandaid the poorly thought out plot was one of the most most predictable and cheesy films ive ever seen the jokes were absolutely horrible even the actors did a poor job of acting you would think some of these top level actors would have said some latching about the script before accepting their roles i would be embarrassed to be in this movie i do not know one person that has enjoyed this movie in the slightest im positive that all these good reviews other people are leaving are either paid for or just tom cruise fans who will rate him 1010 no matter what
Jul 31 2018,positive,epic intense movie you want to see it again
Jul 31 2018,positive,the perfect example for the metaphor an old wine in a new bottle leveraging the latest technologies to bring out the latest installment in the series  the prejudice that we have whenever we get to hear about a mission impossible movie is that it has a lot of action sequences high speed car chase expensive cars and a world domination always thwarted by the hero this may to a very large extent seem like a carbon copy of any james bond movie except for one major factor tom cruise with age catching up on the hollywood heartthrob it is his sheer perseverance grit determination and hard work that makes the movie a successful venture an actor well past his prime volunteers to perform his stunts himself even after repeated injuries all this when you are 56 years old deserves not just a pat on the back but all the adulation that he can                commercial movies are an expensive product add in tom cruise the expenses just doubled however when there is a sure shot formula for a successful movie the budget to make one would just be a secondary concern as you have the best technicians at your service in such an environment the technical aspects of the movie will far excel the expected output and redraw boundaries and set new standards for all future movies mission impossible  fallout is the standard template on how to make a successful commercial movie while elevating itself as a wholesome movie  for the complete and detailed review check out the link  
Jul 31 2018,positive,crazy stunts superb action exotic locations  everything youd expect from an mi fallout was awesome
Jul 31 2018,positive,fallout has a recipe to success that is quite similar to the rest of the movies in the seriesbut taking the insanity in edgy stunt sequences to a whole new level is quite orgasmic
Jul 31 2018,positive,lots of action keeps you entertained the whole time 
Jul 31 2018,positive,perfect congratulations
Jul 31 2018,positive,fallout builds upon its predecessors in every way not just in its jaw dropping action spectacles but the fact that the film spends time carefully fleshing out these characters that we have come to love throughout the last 6 films and 22 years fallouts all star cast are also one of the main reasons this film works so well like always cruise pegg and ferguson are all delightfully charismatic and effective in their roles and newcomer henry cavill is very effective in his cold and blunt acting as agent walker
Jul 31 2018,positive,i think this was the best mission impossible if you liked the others youll also enjoy this
Jul 31 2018,positive,the mission impossible series of films have certainly broken the trend of movies get worse as the sequels move forward  it seems like the last three or four have been really good and the first one or two were only soso  now we have mission impossible fallout  first the  good stuff as visually the stunts and action here rival any movie  the reason being is cgi is used only when necessary and it doesnt replace real live stunts  everyone falls back into their roles quite nicely and the story is interesting enough to hold our attention  the downside to me is that there are too many no way sequences  tom cruise cant run in an all out sprint for over five minutes  i mean come on  the helicopter chase while visually really cool is also a little too far fetched for me  also a fifteen minute countdown in the movie actually took 25 minutes i looked at my watch out of curiosity  all that being said the twists and turns are pretty cool  you see some from a mile away and others are a good surprise  its a solid sequel but id like to see some more weight and depth to it if they continue
Jul 31 2018,positive,i saw this movie the other nightin 3d and it doesnt disappoint this is one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best action movies ive seen in a long time they really hit it out of the park with this one tom cruise is amazing in this movie he doesnt age and the rest of the cast shines too ving rhames simon pegg rebecca ferguson alec baldwin and henry cavill are all good the story is pretty decent too and continues where rogue nation left off do yourself a favor and go see this one you will not be disappointed 
Jul 31 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is one of the best action films of 2018 the plot is well thought out and the fight scenes were just magnificent the only probably was it was too long i think it couldve been a little shorter
Jul 31 2018,positive,mi6fallout review    fallout had a cliche  very predictable plot which was served with high octane brisk  risky action portions entire cast including tom cruise gave a very blend  forceful performance in terms of acting which i wasnt too disappointed over well expecting an all out aclass performance in every mainstream crash  bang action flick is being too disective however the closeup vivid shots  wide angle shots for all the action portions were sharp  without a doubt showed off the excellence of vfx but the cinematography ill say it was just above average all in all the films quick  intelligible screenplay didnt bore one bit but in overall fallout wasnt memorable    rating  6810
Jul 31 2018,positive,absolutely fabulous loved every minute of this movie 
Jul 31 2018,positive,best mission impossible of all
Jul 31 2018,positive,full of action hard not to love mission impossible movies we enjoyed the time immersed in the story just a good time with 25 hours to forget your stress
Jul 31 2018,positive,tom cruise can do it all this franchise continues to get better and better rebecca ferguson is a stand out 
Jul 31 2018,positive,great entertaining funny edge of your seat more than just a popcorn movie it had a good story great performances by tom cruise and the female leads 
Jul 31 2018,positive,with a running time close to 2 12 hours theres bound to be some lulls and extraneous scenes that should be cut out entirely but you dont really notice them here the action is spread out and allowed to breathe throughout the movie the only knock that brings this one down is a few that could never happen scenes ie hunt gets hit by a car while on a motorcycle stumbles around a bit dives into bushes that conveniently are obscuring the precise extraction point for the patiently waiting mi team
Jul 31 2018,positive,excellent chase sequences good story  hard to follow for moments with all the consecutive twists   mission impossible delivers and it is all what you expect it to be
Jul 31 2018,positive,great action flick best mission impossible yet
Jul 31 2018,positive,im not a tom cruz fan but i have to admit he is pretty on this movie 
Jul 31 2018,positive,hella scenes just as good the others 
Jul 31 2018,negative,i loved the first five parts but this one it was boring a lot of unnecessary dialog and many predicted scenes more talk less action the only sort of interesting part was the end the car hook scene was ridiculous nonsensesuspense 
Jul 31 2018,positive,fantastic movie  beautifully shot and creativity was original movie started off with a bang and never slowed down  best mission impossible so far  
Jul 31 2018,positive,hilarious and good action 
Jul 31 2018,positive,one of the best action movies in recent time  dont give a second thought and go for it
Jul 31 2018,positive,ethan hunt does it again cruise is exceptional never a dull moment loved every minute deserves its rating 
Jul 31 2018,positive,best one of the franchise by far
Jul 31 2018,positive,best action in the series but cavills character is a waste of space the plot also goes in too many directions but its so much fun you forget about most of it
Jul 31 2018,positive,ehnot so great yes there is plenty of action and even some plot but nothing to write home about we saw at the theatre on east 86th street in manhattan mistake theatre is horrible go to the one on broadway and 67th street
Jul 31 2018,negative,overrated movie was ok series best absolutely not ghost protocol is fallout lacks a great villain henry did a good job tho story plot was ok this is the hardest part of making a film getting the right story but everything else looks dull the colors all the same the only memorable scene is the bathroom one but the rest is just much of the same and again every scene seems similar the boring cream color i want a surreal experience anyways it was ok nothing new or out of the ordinary here i really dont get the hype at all people must be high or really boring these days
Jul 31 2018,positive,cruise turns back the clock again not sure how many more times he can do it but ill watch every time he tries non stop action with twists and turns at every corner 
Jul 31 2018,positive,i love the movie sow much with tom i hope they make a 7 movie 
Jul 31 2018,positive,good fun intense action movie some nice plot twists and great call backs to the earlier movies

Jul 31 2018,positive,beautiful cinematography with good choreography and a solid story everything a decent movie needs the acting was fantastic and you can feel the emotions from certain characters 
Jul 31 2018,positive,one of if not the best mission impossible movie yet 
Jul 31 2018,positive,2 hrs and 27 mins of nonstopedge of your seat action really enjoyed this movielike reuniting with a bunch of old friends
Jul 31 2018,positive,this was as good as any mission impossible that preceeded it its a great action movie period tom cruise excells as ethan hawk the series should end here dont mess up a good thing 
Jul 30 2018,positive,tom cruise stars in this edge of your seat stuntfilled twisty turny nuclear thriller ving rhames and rebecca fergusson turn in the best performances with alec baldwin and henry cavill both doing their best work for ages i really enjoyed this film which picks up plot strands from previous outings but without you needing to see them this feels the most like the tv series of the six imf films it has excellent cinematography supported by an energetic and driving score that uses lalo schifrins original score rather well none of that awful shakey cam fighting here just concise editing that clearly communicates the action and geography of each sequence the fight choreography team bring a bruising physicality to the combat and its a big improvement over the invunerable ethan hunt from the earlier outings this is tom cruises best film for ages well worth your time
Jul 30 2018,positive,great movie it was exciting and worth the cost of a ticket to see it in a big theater 
Jul 30 2018,positive,absolutely fantastic and a must see in imax

Jul 30 2018,positive,it is perhaps the best action movie ive ever seen
Jul 30 2018,positive,ive seen every major movie of this summer and mission impossible fallout is hands down the best action packed from start to finish incredible acting amazing well written story mi fallouts got it all and then some for the best experience go see it in 3d im going for a second viewing later this week to see it in 4dx  a thrilling ride i cant wait to experience again
Jul 30 2018,positive,this is best movie so far in mission impossible series amazing action and story this is type of movies that we should see that are not just focused on action only but something positive feelings life of one is as much important as of millions    second best movie of 2018 after avengers infinity wars avengers infinity wars will remain first best for infinite time    but not its time for your mission should you choose to accept it
Jul 30 2018,positive,45  mission impossible fallout is a really good movie but it is overrated  it is not the best mission impossible movie but it has some awesome action scenes a thrilling story and the best villain since the 3rd film
Jul 30 2018,positive,one of the greatest action films of all time 
Jul 30 2018,positive,one of the best mission impossible movies ever tom cruise was amazing
Jul 30 2018,positive,the only movie series that keeps me awake once again does its job
Jul 30 2018,positive,fast thrilling action film that still give you insane stunts and some laughs great summer flick that proves this series is still going forward at a great pace
Jul 30 2018,positive,other than a predictable development in a certain character fallout is a brilliant blockbuster fans and moviegoers have been hoping for its the dark knight of the mi series
Jul 30 2018,positive,movie was amazing tom cruises halo jump was real and the movie was all around incredible 
Jul 30 2018,positive,action scenes are amazing and incredibly realistic the performances were great in this movie and especially by simon pegg definitely one of the best movies of the year
Jul 30 2018,positive,from start to end mission impossiblefallout is an action roller coaster ride if you dont question reality it is a thrilling one perennially young tom cruise smirks and grimaces his way through without becoming annoying superman is his sidekick and several great kickass women  and the signature score works every time  just go for entertaining fun
Jul 30 2018,positive,lots of thrills great effects cinematography and a story that makes this one of the best action movies ever made 
Jul 30 2018,positive,really solid great action not as good of a mystery relies a lot on knowledge of the previous film 
Jul 30 2018,positive,best mission impossible to date saw this in imax on sunday and wow non stop action from start to finish action scenes were well done acting and cast amazing just a really fun and enjoyable movie mad props to jj abrams for really taking this franchise to new levels every time
Jul 30 2018,positive,best one of them all  a great fun ride
Jul 30 2018,positive,based on the reviews expected a fantastic flick from opening scene some of the acting delivery is very very average  action this is excellent bigscreen entertainment the bigger the screen the better
Jul 30 2018,positive,best in series after 22 years tom cruise will has it as ethan hunt the action antics and edge of your seat action makes this movie keep you begging for more if you liked previous mi movies youll love this one
Jul 30 2018,negative,blah  i will admit this is my first mission impossible movie  must have a cult following  thought it was tired and so many things taken from other movies italian job james bond bourne movies  it was amazing how more and more ridiculous it got as the movie went on  unfortunately 212 hours ill never get back  its a shame tom cruise keeps making these silly movies  hes more talented than this
Jul 30 2018,positive,this was pretty freakin awesome saw it in the theatre no other way soundtrack was a lot of fun too
Jul 30 2018,positive,35 good summer action movie  more chasing than fighting though there is certainly fighting if you have liked the previous mission impossible movies i think you will like this fast pace engaging a bit of humor lots of angst
Jul 30 2018,positive,as a 6th in the series its quite fantastic  not quite as funny or quirky but every bit as thrilling and remarkable that cruise doesnt die amongst all foes  what i like best  its not predictable when you think they are going somewhere they quickly swerve left then right
Jul 30 2018,positive,okay just gotta say ittom cruise is nuts there is zero reason for a guy whos a very successful movie star to do jacky chanlevel stunt action in to his 50s there is no cliff he wont jump off of no building he wont scale no motorcycle he wont crashit just goes on and onfor the audiences entertainment twistyturny and more humor than one might expect and not always from simon pegg amazing 20 years in and the american james bond still top of  his game
Jul 30 2018,positive,maybe im crazy but i thought this was corny with a chopped up story the action was great and tom is the man but mi fallout reaffirmed to me that television is the new medium
Jul 30 2018,positive,great sequel probably the best mi ever hi action at all times
Jul 30 2018,positive,the action in it is spectacular it keeps you engaged and in the story story is good predictable but only because it follows what mission movies are known for and if it turned out differently it would have been too safe of a story acting of course is on point and the practical stunts are done with precision the nod thrown in to a previous mission movie is fantastic 
Jul 30 2018,positive,peak mission impossible amazing action twists turns and even some compelling actingsee it in imax
Jul 30 2018,positive,some crazy fight scenes and car chases
Jul 30 2018,positive,even though you know it will all work out n the end you still find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat during this movie up to the very end
Jul 30 2018,positive,for me this movie had 3 phases  paris  london   kashmir    to my mind i would have had phase 3 in another iconic city as  the contrast between phases 1 and 2 with phase 3 were too great  top marks for the stunts  except the two destroyed helicopter shells on a roller coaster ride down the side of a mountain and dangling via a cable seemed unnecessary given the edge of seat helicopter duel   i got lost in the london cellar when there was a round table on who was the villain  i probably need to re watch that scene several times to figure out who was who  my idea for the next mission impossible is a cross between the current one and district 9 one of my all time favorites and mission impossible fallout  where tom spearheads an attack on aliens on their turf to save the earth   aussie  bob  dixon
Jul 30 2018,positive,i never thought a sixth entry in a franchise could be the best one from its intelligent script and incredible practical action scenes
Jul 30 2018,positive,loved this movie it has action humor plot  very entertaining and fun to watch i do not understand why few people are complaining about it please lighten up and remember we all go to the movies for the fun for the fantasy for the fiction and to transport ourselves to another world go see this movie its really good 
Jul 30 2018,positive,this action movie is great i had no sleep for 24 hours when i watched this movie i was so hyped every time there was action stunt for a person who has a hypersomnia like me this action movie kept me awake last night and btw spoiler alert i think i saw vannessa kirby used butterfly knife or batangas knife  she used it with class all action stunt looks so natural  dmn cool
Jul 30 2018,positive,i thought it was a great film at first i rolled my eyes as there are only a few global crisis scenarios out there that you can plausibly discuss and the mi series has covered most of them already suffice to say that i was pleasantly surprised that a similar scenario that we have heard and seen before in other mis and other action films in general could have a fresh twist action was great acting was great except for maybe the guy who played walker he was acting a few times there cruise was impressive great ending overall we had a great time watching it and it made for a great evening
Jul 30 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout packs a thriller action punch to the gut by providing some of the best filmed set pieces you will ever encounter in a action movie tom cruise carries his role with confidence by also packing it with a smartly written espionage plot that features surprises and good character development with real stakes at them it is the best action movie you will probably get to see in 2018 
Jul 30 2018,positive,a bit slow to start and overall a bit long at 25 hours but enough edge of your seat in between time to make up for it great summer action film
Jul 30 2018,positive,as always u could expect lots of action in these franchisegood pop corn movie  having henry cavil in it wasnt too unpleasant either 
Jul 30 2018,positive,as is the same with all mission impossible movies great action humour and fab plot the best since 2 
Jul 30 2018,positive,best action movie of all time  tom cruise at the epitome of his career   a must watch  i will go and watch it over and over again to be able to contribute to its box office records 
Jul 30 2018,positive,a non stop thrill ride as we travel with cruise through another impossible mission the special effects are outstanding the story line is exciting and fast moving i would reconmmend 3d  imax or extreme viewing for the full experience this is one i will see againsomething i never do congratulations to all who were part of this spectacular project
Jul 30 2018,positive,one of the best action movie ive ever seen smart action pack suspenseful and fun to watch
Jul 30 2018,positive,one of the best spy action movies of the decade
Jul 30 2018,positive,in a world where many big franchises are overstaying their welcome and making diminishing returns mission impossible  fallout comes out with a jawdropping bang and sees tom cruise and christopher mcquarrie at the height of insane action filmmaking
Jul 30 2018,positive,amazing work by writer director christopher mcquarrie intelligent and action arent exactly easy dance partners   and tom cruise is at his best seriously the helicopter stunts prove hes the hardest working most daring actor working today
Jul 30 2018,positive,great nonstop action from beginning to end it didnt even seem like it was a long 227 hr movie
Jul 30 2018,positive,great action good story not alot of down time acting was good
Jul 30 2018,positive,this was so good very fun movie fast paced well done    you dont even realize that its almost 3 hours long and when its over you want to see it again possibly even better than the first mission impossible movie   
Jul 30 2018,positive,i think this is the platonic ideal of a mission impossible movie
Jul 30 2018,positive,awesome moviei love tom cruise
Jul 30 2018,positive,loved one of the best films of the year
Jul 30 2018,positive,such a good movie was never bored at all
Jul 30 2018,positive,the absolute best in the franchise
Jul 30 2018,positive,amazing movie best mission impossible ever tom cruise does his own stunts breaks his ankle on a huge building gap jump for real edge of your seat action packed movie with a really good plot wow cant wait to see it again dont miss this one cruise is back 
Jul 30 2018,positive,for me this is up there with the best action movies of all time incredible performances and the action is beyond amazing what an achievement
Jul 30 2018,positive,best movie of the year one of the greatest actionthrillers ever produced see it in imax 
Jul 30 2018,positive,wow mi and tom cruise keep the series going strong
Jul 30 2018,negative,found the movie boring yes there are moments of action that are top otch but then its followed by 20 mins of bad writing
Jul 30 2018,positive,usually people hate on tom cruise movies simply because hes in them so i figured with this having a 97 score the movie had to be greatand it was
Jul 30 2018,positive,amazing from start to finish the music is great the action is good its realistic and awesome
Jul 30 2018,positive,one of the best films in the franchise great cast action packed and not a dull moment throughout the film 
Jul 30 2018,negative,normally a big mi fan but hated this watched it in imax  everything shot in unsaturated colours with heavily blurred backgrounds  3d effects largely non existent and irritating watching over someones blurred shoulder loses impact after numerous scenes  chase scenes so long you are left praying for a crash or someone to get caught
Jul 30 2018,neutral,i was so disappointed in this movie   the reviews were wonderful   however i found the movie very slow   yes the scenes in the helicoptor were awesome   but this was a remake of the same movie   i am definitely over this franchise   i thought it was just me but we were a party of 7 and every one of us felt the movie was redundant and slow   i couldnt wait for it to be over
Jul 30 2018,positive,if youre a fan of the series or just love action films this is the movie for you i fall under both personally and you can add a fan of tom cruise movies with that said long running fans of the series will find the twists of be fairly predictable thats really my only knock on this film if you go in expecting a fun action film to pass the time youll get more than your moneys worth
Jul 30 2018,positive,the last 2 movies were outstanding and this one somehow topped them both
Jul 30 2018,positive,action sequence in this movie was great but there  not much meat in story line  
Jul 30 2018,negative,same mi script with average acting little twists and notso innovative action pumps
Jul 30 2018,positive,great action funny and slick this franchise continues to grow and get better when it should be tired and getting worse
Jul 30 2018,positive,mi fallout adds another worthy blockbuster to the iconic franchise with adrenalinefueled action reliable leads and breathtaking stunts
Jul 30 2018,positive,a theater experience at its finest uncommonly great action movie
Jul 30 2018,positive,riveting twists and turns hearty action sequences and wonderful screenplay presented by all involved mission impossible fallout is the best entry to the series so far heres hoping cruise  co still have big plans for the future
Jul 30 2018,positive,it has taken on average 35 years for tom cruise to release mission impossible movies since the first came out back in 1999  for my money over the last 20 years this is the best action franchise in hollywood still making movies  i stated it after i saw ghost protocol and again after rogue nation tom cruise  love him or hate him  is hollywoods best action hero  much like those other two film i just mentioned fallout earns its 5star rating and cements the franchise as one of the best    cruise is an anomaly  both revered for his acting chops but seared for his offcamera beliefs and actions in his private life i think he has mostly leveled out as a pretty genuine guy since he left the daytoday spotlight a handful of years ago  he is the best action star hollywood has for this generation  hes a selfproclaimed perfectionist  every stunt all done himself every thread and every interaction in the movie is tailored to his vision  the movie is a mirror to cruise as an actor exhilarating cool humorous and a bit dangerous  his stunts are breathtaking  from the halo jump in the opening third to the car chases foot chases and motorcycle chases in the middle to the unbelievable helicopter fight scene in the final third cruise leaves it all out on the table  theres a point where he says to his team on the ground he wont let them down  i have full confidence he meant for that to be a nod to the audience as well    also back for the first time is repeat director and famed oscarwinning hollywood screenwriter christopher mcquarrie  he filmed rogue nation so it was only right he return to wrap up a story over the two films we saw begin in the former      while i wont harp on the plot too much we get a brief recap of what the team has been up to in the two years from the end of rogue nation to the start of fallout after that its off and running with twists turns dips and dives of a classic spy thriller to keep track of where everyone stands    rebecca ferguson ving rames simon pegg and alec baldwin are all back  the only conspicuous actor missing was jeremy renner due to a scheduling conflict but i found it a tad off putting he wasnt even mentioned because he did survive rogue nation  also back is the villain sean harris as the vile solomon lane  we get introduced to three new players as well angela bassett as a cia big wig henry cavil as her cia operative and vanessa kirby as a new broker for bad guys pay close attention to her story for those easter eggs  all of them are tremendous in their roles      overall if you are looking for the summer blockbuster that was promises but hadnt delivered because of a slow and tired hollywood output look no further  mi6 continues to bring the pain and will almost certainly lend itself to a seventh film down the line  its just a shame we have to wait another 35 years to get the next
Jul 30 2018,positive,awesome action movie   the only action movie which is a competition is mad max fury road  overall an awesome movie
Jul 30 2018,positive,great fun tom still has it superman did great
Jul 30 2018,positive,great movie and story line must see
Jul 30 2018,positive,it might sound like hyperbole but this is easily one of the best action movies of the decade possibly ever made its got everything you want from insane stunts to a great script some good humor and a really good story surprisingly tom cruise dont ever stop being an insane person because we need more movies like this go see it asap
Jul 30 2018,neutral,i give this movie a 25 out of 5 the fact that it gets any stars at all is purely based on the incredible stunts performed by the cast stylistically and visually the movie is stunning especially in imax however as usual the modern action movie is relying a bit too much on flash without any substance the plot is an intermingled mess the villain played by henry cavill leaves you bored and of course if you really want to come out and say it tom cruise has made himself into a self anointed jesus in these movies its a bit too much take off the crown tom 
Jul 30 2018,positive,the best action movie you can ever see other movies are just mishmashes of junk and  bad action scenes buy this movie is just mind blowing the plot storyline acting graphics direction and action is amazing great movie for me the best movie i have ever seen till now is mission impossible 6
Jul 30 2018,positive,the best mission ever
Jul 30 2018,positive,cant fault this film  action packed and whats even more astonishing is that tom cruise doesnt even use a stunt double i genuinely didnt think that was possible until watching behind the scenes of him learning to fly a helicopter just so they could have him do it in the actual film  5 just for his commitment to the role
Jul 30 2018,positive,fantastic nonstop action
Jul 30 2018,positive,really cant figure out how theres currently a 98 critic rating on this movie while theres no question that it is visually stunning and with some amazing action scenesthe attraction ends there the plot is predictable most of the same old mi moves are rehashed the love triangle to try to add dramatic tension is contrived and not really believable theres one scene with ving rhames that is so poorly done as to be cringe worthy for pure action filled catharsis this is fantastic but if you are expecting some oscar type originality depth and complexity like i would expect from a 98 critics scoreyou will not find it here
Jul 30 2018,positive,tom cruise and company have returned for a sixth installment of the long running 6 films 22 years mission impossible franchise who wouldve thought theyd save their best stuff for the sixth film here is my review of mission impossible  fallout    in the sixth film in the series we are reunited with tom cruise and his infamous ethan hunt character as well as the rest of the gang simon pegg and ving rhames this film is directed and written by christopher mcquarrie this is the second mission impossible he has directed the first being mission impossible  rogue nation 2015 following all the hype mustered up by this film i found myself surprisingly excited to see it i got to see the opening day viewing and i was not disappointed christopher mcquarrie is the perfect director for these films as proven by two backtoback successful films as well as this being in my opinion the best film in the franchise to date fallout is a sheer epic it has everything you want in an action film and it does it all perfectly while giving the audience some intense and topnotch barrages of action writerdirector christopher mcquarrie balanced in a very strong and clear pointed plot this perfect balance made for a perfect action film     tom cruise yet again delivers a strong performance and his stunts continue to be jawdropping mcquarries direction with these action sequences are perfect and some stunning and edgeoftheseat scenes do happen rather frequently in this film henry cavill is also in this movie and it was great to finally see the now infamousstache on the big screen i had my slight doubts in him at times during the movie but continuously with each and every passing scene cavill seemed to just get better and better he brought a lot to the film and definitely served a strong purpose simon pegg is entertaining as always as is ving rhames sean harris is also in the film and he brings a good strong presence as the films mysterious villainous character harris owns the role and brings genuine darkness to the film     what puts this film head and shoulders above other action flicks is the insane and pristine camera work some of the shots that were taken during this film are absolutely stunning and i found myself turning to the person beside me admiring these shots on several occasions this all made for rather grand and certainly epic scenes the moment i left the theatre i was ready to turn back around and head back in for more     while the story isnt necessarily fresh christopher mcquarrie does a good job at telling this story and unfolding a very pictureperfect spy film there are some characters i definitely would have liked to have seen developed more as previously stated the brilliance in balance within the film is truly unmatched and story is not compromised at the hands of over usage of cgi or cheap jokes this is the quintessential action movie of 2018 and the summer blockbuster we needed oh so badly
Jul 30 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen actionpacked thrilling funny beautiful  everything youd expect to see in such a movie
Jul 30 2018,positive,simply put best one yet entire cast plot and visuals on point 
Jul 30 2018,positive,pretty good movie but not enough spaghetti
Jul 30 2018,positive,5 stars because it was my first 3d movie ever lots of action i would have given 1 star without the 3d i am not really into spy movies my suggestion is to watch this movie in 3d
Jul 30 2018,negative,overrated filled with cliches and cringeworthy dialogue you have to have a low iq for this type of film to enjoy it
Jul 30 2018,positive,excellent its a non stop hell of a ride tom cruise is a legend total badass
Jul 30 2018,positive,loved it summer blockbuster is back in a world of cgi action movies its always a treat to have another movie such as mad max which the majority of the stunts involve real people and real vehicles bravo to the stunt crew great film will def see it again
Jul 30 2018,positive,its truly impossible for a franchise to sustain this much momentum but here it is with an adrenaline rush of the highest order
Jul 30 2018,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Jul 30 2018,positive,thrillride from start to finish your mission should you choose to accept it the words we all have grown to connect with action spies secrets and of course tom cruise this sixth installment to classic and ever improving franchise series has proven to live up to the critics hype this film has surpassed its predecessors just as each installment has seemed to do from the opening scene to the roll of the credits this movie had me on the edge of the seat with palms sweaty and the steady sound of my thumping heart beat conflicting situations that seem to have no possible solution fill the runtime along with brilliant camera work thatll slow down the epic sequences into moments thatll be remembered forever mcquarrie proves he has the masterful talent to carry out this franchise into the masterpiece each new installment has become his filmmaking will leave you feeling for each character whether good or bad and feeling every punch they take as well proven with just one viewing this film is a masterpiece its one for the shelf and one thatll entertain for decades and decades to come calling it close as the imf team famously does is exactly what this film doesnt do it calls it as soon as it starts its first scene because this one has taken the top of its series and of the summer action adventure suspense running halo jumps helicopter chases and one hell of an ending thatll not be confirmed nor denied of course without the approval of the secretary 1010 te 72818
Jul 30 2018,positive,a flawless wildly entertaining summer blockbuster that wont soon be forgotten christopher mcquarrie and tom cruise deliver one of the very best action epics ever made
Jul 30 2018,positive,very predictable first half of the movie we were able to guess the next line in the script the second half of the movie gets more interesting
Jul 30 2018,positive,now this is how you do a summer blockbuster film the mustache problems from justice league was worth it in order for henry cavills role to be more effective this movie had everything you could ask for all the crazy stunts were all done by tom cruises stunt double tom cruise but seriously it makes the action sequences that much more exciting knowing that tom did all of his stunts the supporting cast also did a wonderful job the comedic relief couldnt be pulled off any more perfectly without being out of place by simon pegg as benji ving rhames is the down to earth tech specialist luther who brings a calming presence to such frantic scenes rebecca ferguson is essentially the badass mi6 agent ilsa who brings a balance with her action scenes and love interest to ethan hunt the story starts out with ethan hunt essentially trying to track 3 plutonium cores that he let get into the wrong hands because he focused on saving one of his team members instead of sacrificing them to save the millions alex baldwin is awesome as the head of the cia we are also graced by the ageless angela bassett who not only has short scenes but brings a presence of authority that no other person could pull off the only thing that may not be as powerful as the previous mission impossible entries is the musical score nothing really stood out to specially since ive heard the likes of hans zimmer put their touch on the series it was all mainly orchestral scores and it enhanced a lot of the scenes because theres so much going on the cinematography is well done the beautifully placed shots of the kashmir regions and the way the scenes are composed fit perfectly to the movie it didnt try to take something from a paul greengrass bourne movie with its shaky cam styles or a more muted color scheme like the latest bond films i recommend everybody to watch this film specially while its in the theater to fully get that summer blockbuster feeling the action scenes are so much better and you will have a great time oohing aahing and gasping much like my fellow moviegoers in the theater with me
Jul 30 2018,positive,very good movie best of the franchise ving rames is getting old brother enjoyed it very much i will but the blue ray when it comes out 
Jul 30 2018,positive,good movie story and interesting ending
Jul 30 2018,negative,too many characters and the characters are just not believeable the action is not believeable there are often times several different groups fighting in different loctions at once and you spin around to follow the dialouge is teenage the idea that these guys can understand how to diffuse a nuclear bomb is just too ridiculous to keep you interested without rolling your eyes if you like fantasy and you like dialog  for middle school teens this is ok for you if you like realisteic secret agent movies look at bond first
Jul 30 2018,positive,awesome at every second
Jul 30 2018,positive,why did this movie get 98 critics94 audience  i guess i understand the fans but the critics  this is a 2 12 star movie at best  formulaic predictable corny  the stunts were impressive as well as exotic locales  i guess someone finally figured out how to game the rotten tomatoes algorithm in their favor
Jul 30 2018,positive,love it one of the best
Jul 30 2018,positive,does what it says on the box
Jul 30 2018,positive,best of the mi movies  have to watch this one on imax to get the wow effect  story cinematography and stunts are out of this world and unique  got to give to a guy who at 55 and can still do those stunts the cast is also excellent  well worth watching
Jul 30 2018,positive,spectacular action movie must watch and probably the best in the series
Jul 30 2018,positive,when was the last time you went to see a perfect movie from beginning to end i am not the biggest tom cruise fan but this was just awesome entertainment
Jul 30 2018,positive,the best movie ive seen in 2018 so far saw it twice in one day tom cruise is the man in his best overall performance as the now iconic ethan hunt simon pegg henry cavill rebecca ferguson and sean harris are all great as well the action is some of the best ever put on film
Jul 30 2018,neutral,action is fine as always but why so long you reach a point that you just want it to end
Jul 30 2018,negative,long and same as last one 
Jul 30 2018,positive,a lot of action and unexpected plot twist totally recommend its worth the watch
Jul 30 2018,positive,some pretty cool twists and turns some predictable others throw you for a loop well worth the price of admission 
Jul 30 2018,positive,10 2 hours and 27 minutes they did not disappoint these movies are all about the same but i still enjoyed them if you were a fan you would like this movie as well plenty of nonbelievable actually in a pretty cool plot with a theme
Jul 30 2018,positive,tom does it again this time with a few new additions to the previous cast good story action and great stunts make for another enjoyable experience go see it and enjoy it for yourself
Jul 30 2018,positive,good action that you expect for this movie 
Jul 30 2018,positive,very much enjoyed this not sure that it has much greater emotional depth than the others but bless them for trying and the action sequences were amazing to watch especially in imax
Jul 30 2018,positive,i think this film is incredible as much as i have enjoyed that amazing resurrection of the series by jj abrams mi3 because of that great scooby doo implementation and overall quality of the story and action sequences i think mission impossible fallout is just extremely impressive    its rare to see something similar in todays cinema but tom cruise doing all the practical effect in the film is extremely admirable and brings some extremely exciting action sequences that wouldnt have looked as good otherwise    but this film is not just tom cruise and his insanity mi6 has a great story the story is actually incredible it knows what was done in the past it knows that people are going to figure our twists by now so what was done they twist the twist its just incredible    music in this film is also the best one yet in this franchise when i saw lorne balfes name at the start of the film i was like its such an obvious choice to have him on board hes made some incredible work in ubisofts assassins creed series and having him here bring that orchestral glory that the film needed so much the usual theme track was completely transformed it gave fallout the true sound and weight    overall i must say i dont think this franchise can get any better i think it should be the last film such a grand ending if theres going to be more films coming well im waiting but it probably wont be superior to this its actually  mission impossible
Jul 30 2018,negative,awful terrible acting writing is weak directing is barely passable action is boring and minimal and plot is painfully predictable and slow do not see this 
Jul 30 2018,positive,this was a fantastic action movie where i was entertained the whole way through bonus i walked out of the theater relieved i did not pay for 25 hours of liberal propaganda and brain washing
Jul 30 2018,positive,heart was literally clenched for the last 45 minutes
Jul 30 2018,positive,couldnt expect a better action movie than this love tom cruise so smart brave and gentlemen plan to go back watching again in 3d
Jul 30 2018,positive,best one yet and almost zero downtime ending proves that sequels are in the works 
Jul 30 2018,positive,had a lot of fun watching this one 
Jul 30 2018,positive,was better then i was expecting there is only one down side to it the actor who played superman was a bad guy i wasnt expecting that by any means
Jul 30 2018,neutral,mission impossible fallout was a very overwhelming film full of different plot twists which can make the audience confused the movie revealed different antagonists one by one bloating up the movie and causing the movie to be hard to follow
Jul 30 2018,positive,just mind blowing  must watch for movie fans
Jul 30 2018,positive,is the movie of the year 
Jul 30 2018,positive,there is no perfect movie and this one has its flaws too but man the action here is unprecedented and against beautiful backdrops these make it awesome sorry thats the best i can come up with  and the fact that tom cruise did his stunts really added so much interest and rave for this newest installment of the mission impossible series  in all honestly i hate watching films but its the first movie i reserved seats for earlier online in a posh theatre cmon its cruise and caville
Jul 30 2018,positive,mission ridiculous   we live in a time of total escapism in movies very few are serious or have any relation to real life   this movie is like that  it is hard to think of any scene in m that is believable  i found mysels saying cmon man this is just silly  there is a little winking at the audience in the midst of danger as if to say we know this is just pretend  oh well nobody agrees with me
Jul 30 2018,positive,tom normally a tom cruise fan but i do enjoy his mi movies still this was also very good granted there were the usual movie magic parts where everything happened perfectly for the heroes but thats expected i would have preferred the movie start off a little darker to give some more tension i always enjoy movies better when the bad guys do in fact win a few rounds because it actually ups the intensity as you dont always know exactly what will happen that wasnt the case with this movie and why i only give a 4 but overall a very solid and entertaining action movie
Jul 30 2018,positive,tom cruise is able to outdo himself once more with the deathdefying stunts and effortless drawpower mission impossible fallout utilizes its starstellar cast dynamic plot and unique twist and turns to serve up another blockbuster hit to add to the nowinnovative action franchise 4455
Jul 30 2018,positive,3d was amazing i might go back to see it again
Jul 30 2018,positive,best mission impossible film released with clever shots surprising twists and great moments
Jul 29 2018,positive,hands down one of the best action films to have come along in quite some time the films many action sequences are well done but they arent the only elements carrying the story in this one the flashy chases and stunts are effectively balanced by an engaging narrative that despite a few plot holes provides a riveting tale full of twists turns and misdirections this is a franchise that just seems to be getting better with time fasten your seat belts
Jul 29 2018,positive,tom cruise is badass in this thanks for the entertainment
Jul 29 2018,positive,fallout is everything you would expect from the mi film series espionage backstabbing twists intense action scenes some over the top but not fast and furious level bits of comedy especially from ving rhames and simon pegg and tom cruise running like hes chasing usain bolt by this point everyone knows what theyre in for the shit hits the fan and tom cruise and his lovable cast of merry agents have to clean it however adding henry superman cavill to the cast for this go around did add more intensity and seriousness then usual which is good you will see some twists a mile away but honestly if youre reading this youve probably seen at least 2 mi movies and know the drill i really liked the soundtrack for this movie and the action scenes are never too far apart for those that hate too much talking in an action blockbuster it was a fun and entertaining ride probably my favorite one next two mi 2 yeah dont hate lol  final review 9 out of 10 is tom cruise a vampire he doesnt age
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie the story follows the series blueprint but masterfully executed rian johnson the last jedi director should take note on how this movie subverts tropes without alienating the dedicated fans and simultaneously entertaining the general audience
Jul 29 2018,positive,awesome acting action and adventure everything you could want for an outing to the movies brisk pacing with wonderful locations only complaint is i wish their had been more time to develop the romance next time perhaps cruise  ferguson make a lovely team
Jul 29 2018,positive,at least this series continues to entertain thanks to the outstanding cast for delivering yet another great segment to an outstanding product it did not disappoint
Jul 29 2018,positive,this one is hard for me  for me the plot just tried too hard to be a mission impossible plot  there were some nice twists and surprises but sometimes simpler is just more enjoyable and more entertaining   that being said the action sequences and stunts were simply incredible  cruise doing so much of his own work just adds a level of authenticity to the sequences that maybe no other movie can match  simon and ving were phenomenal as always in their supporting roles  i do wish rebecca has a meatier part in this and would have really enjoyed a showdown with venessa kirby  henry was simply outstanding in his role as walker and i was hoping he could be a recurring foil in upcoming mi films  hopefully this will be a springboard to more action films bond anyone post superman era  the bathroom fight scene might be one of my favorite ever  good movie  great actors
Jul 29 2018,negative,holy krapper bada critics and audience in their mindless slavering are once again overflowing with breathless cliches and brainless superlatives to laud a film that consists of cynical formula actionnonstop chases explosions and expensive video game mayhem talk about a formula run into the ground and a star with so little integrity he keeps producing this mindless entertainment for undiscriminating viewers  dont support this disreputable  tom cruise who has been a shameless shill for scientology for decades  call this waste of money and time mission interminable  as for the craven and uncritical reviewers who laud this formula trash they should have their credentials revoked
Jul 29 2018,positive,possibly the best movie in the serieswe really enjoyed it 
Jul 29 2018,positive,this is the best mission impossible movies ever and the best action movie so far for this year 
Jul 29 2018,negative,best comedy in a while 
Jul 29 2018,positive,of course this movie has all the ingredients and delivery of a summeraction blockbuster movie tom cruise once again shows that he is one of the best action movie stars of all time the action scenes are perfectly executed and nonstop breathtaking love it
Jul 29 2018,positive,its definitive the best mission impossible up to date that was so intense
Jul 29 2018,positive,a bit too long could have shaved those extra 27 minutes off there was a young guy snoring sitting next to me
Jul 29 2018,positive,one heck of a thrill ride that keeps you strapped in your seat it is truly the best mission impossible yet
Jul 29 2018,positive,455  this has footprints of the rising of the dark knight himself  but a mi movie through and through staying true to its roots go see it in imax
Jul 29 2018,positive,another blast of a movie mission impossible fallout delivers on everything that i want from this series  while it doesnt reach the highest of highs like ghost protocol and that breathtaking burj khalifa scene the motorcycle chase along with the final helicopter scene at the end almost make up for it  henry cavill has been working on his american accent  and that mustache along with him charging up his arms during the bathroom fight be still my beating vagina  i loved this movie  cant wait for mi7  justice4henrycavillsmustache
Jul 29 2018,positive,best action movie since skyfall 
Jul 29 2018,positive,awesome storyline and actionpacked scenes all the way throughout a must see flick
Jul 29 2018,positive,unbelievable stunts and the music was perfect could have cut 20 minutes or so and it would have made it tighter best action franchise in the game 
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie action good fun movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,very good  best mission yet 
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of tom cruisees best films a must see
Jul 29 2018,positive,this film is just spectacular and my favorite movie i have seen this year
Jul 29 2018,negative,a james bond movie with none of the cleverness none of the charm and no james
Jul 29 2018,positive,action packed thriller
Jul 29 2018,positive,simply marvelous action sequences
Jul 29 2018,positive,your mission should you choose to accept it i wonder did you ever choose not to the end youve always feared is coming    woah    you know i normally stay cool and collective when movies with this amount of hype blows up but fk it this freaking lived up to the hype i mean wow probably one of the best action movies of the year from start till finish youre captivated by the practicality of these action sequences never feeling repetitive or boring foot chase car chase or helicopter chase  its going to be awhile for any action movie to top what they did    this franchise has age like fine wine    first things first the action scenes  where do i begin or which scene to talk about oh yeah the bathroom scene holy sht talk about a whiteknuckled hand to hand fight no dialogue no music and no shaky cam whatsoever rough and brutal with nothing pretty about it also henry cavill reloading his arms was the cherry on top we will come back to cavill later    the halo sky dive scene was amazing and nuts but whats even more nuts when you find out tom cruise did the stunt over 100 times along with poor craig obrien who captured the stunt from the massive imax camera this explains why it was so intense to watch of course the helicopter sequence which could have been 2 hours and 27 minutes long and i wouldnt be bored    the sound design is really fantastic and really detailed with everything thats going on you can hear the whoosh when someone throws a punch gunshots hitting brick walls or whizz by brought up the intensity    christopher mcquarrie returns as director for the sixth installment and i think he outdid himself this guy knows how to set up the domino effect with certain scenes to surprise and make your jaw drop masterpiece in film making and shot composition  beautifully done by cinematographer rob hardy while its unknown right now who will take over directing for the seven movie but oh boy they got some shoes to fill i dont think mcquarrie can top himself then again i said something similar about rogue nation i will never learn    and hey the villains were pretty menacing this time around a rare thing sometimes in these movies    tom cruise is nearly 60 years old and yet continues to prove age is just a number you can hate or criticize cruise all you want but you gotta respect someone who puts this much dedication in life threatening situations for the right take an action star who puts in the hard work hes basically killing himself for two hours    henry cavill makes a welcome addition to the franchise as a mustache twirling agent cavill is best known for playing superman and made a big name for himself however the movies themselves failed to meet his success in this movie he plays a big bully who isnt afraid to kill on instinct theres something deeply unpleasant about him every time he walks in frame with this stone cold look adds to the uneasiness especially during the fight scenes where cavill shows off his physicality and fast brutal punches this is the best ive seen from him justice league never heard of it    the team dynamic was excellent and gives plenty of room for character development among the anarchy ving rhames simon pegg and rebecca ferguson are all terrific    how is the actual story of the film well nothing original just like the previous ones elevating on presentation and ties in with events on the other movies  involving plenty of twist and turns some people may have an issue with that which i can understand the film demands your attention throughout as references are dropped left and right the movie builds a lot off the previous film which you have to see or remember about because if not then youre lost    if i have to pick any issue it will have to be some of the score now dont get me wrong i thought the score was good and blends perfectly along with the action scenes but it did sound familiar yeah the dark knight rises score people have already brought this up so i become more aware when listening bit distracting as i had the every frame a printing video on hollywood scores  soundtracks in my mind thats it really    overall rating please do yourself a favor and see this on the biggest screen you can the action sound work characters and acting were all superb believe the hype
Jul 29 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Jul 29 2018,positive,fun if you like watching a 56 year old sprinting across the world 
Jul 29 2018,positive,amazing action sequences worthy of any superhero film wonderful to see so many character brought back to tie stories together through the series 
Jul 29 2018,positive,best mission impossible ever
Jul 29 2018,positive,outstanding special effects loved the all the chase scenes especially the helicopter chase well done to all the directors 
Jul 29 2018,positive,i kept thinking  what a badass movie while watching  tom really kicked ass in this one
Jul 29 2018,positive,the best of the series i never thought that they could ever surpass the greatness of ghost protocol however they proved me wrong the stakes were raised and the action scenes were just pure joy and fun thank you tom cruise for this masterpiece and thank you henry cavill for your amazing role as well this is truly amazing
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of the best ones nonstop action 
Jul 29 2018,positive,wow hold on to your seat
Jul 29 2018,positive,best movie in a long time freaking awesome
Jul 29 2018,positive,the movie is great it is twice as insane as ghost protocol in certain ways
Jul 29 2018,positive,super entertaining action flick wont disappoint
Jul 29 2018,neutral,really feels like your typical action movie i wasnt all the impressed great action scenes but a real cookie cutter plot i feel like ive seen 100 times rotten tomatoes ratings are constantly bull
Jul 29 2018,positive,i thought this movie was one of the best of the mi series thus far highly recommend seeing it 
Jul 29 2018,positive,loved it great action love ving rhames chopper scenes and chase scenes were awesome see it 
Jul 29 2018,positive,first off cavill looks more like supermanclark kent in this than has in any movie to date its a pity dc cant get it right  and this does it without even trying    action action action if movies were rated only on the unbelievable stunts and nonstop action this would get 5 stars but at some point you just have to shake your head and stop reveling in just how much tom cruises 58 yearold can really take and just how much luck or conincidence ethan hunt can count on at a certain point you just have to say come on    add a plot thats always twisting and turning outside of the obvious callbacks to previous mi movies youre who now the twist that almost every mi movie has already made really who didnt see that coming music that goes from amazing to annoying  often in the same scene and runtime that just seemed to go on too long    it can be  and is a fun movie there are many gasp inducing moments but it almost seems to be look at what we can do action rather than move the plot along action the awes are awesome and it makes for a thrilling ride but outside of that its goes on too long and relies too much plot twists to be any sort of convincing spy caper
Jul 29 2018,negative,same old same old  save your  and time
Jul 29 2018,positive,another great mission impossible movie cruise and his crew did it again hes getting a little old to play this type of character for me i dont know that i would like it if he was a couple of years older but its been a great run of fun movies
Jul 29 2018,positive,entertaining but formulaic and exceptionally predictable
Jul 29 2018,positive,movie had an intense feeling through out the whole run time best movie in the series in my opinion
Jul 29 2018,negative,this was a very predictable and benign movie this was poorly written the action scenes lasted 23 of the movie making the plot moot the actors did their best and the mi  series  is typically good but this one sucked
Jul 29 2018,positive,wow i think this was the most intense mi of all but it had such amazing twist and turns that i have to see it again loved it 
Jul 29 2018,positive,such a great action movie try and see it in the theater
Jul 29 2018,negative,way to long  im all for impossible stunt scenes but some of these are just a bit to much  most of them took forever to playout  this is a wait for it to come out on netflix movie at best
Jul 29 2018,positive,one action packed train that slows down only briefly at the end to set up the thrilling finale amazing that all the stunts for tom cruise were done by he himself
Jul 29 2018,positive,dont let the last mi movie worry you too much cause this one makes up for it and then some 
Jul 29 2018,negative,nothing but stunts and action scenes no plot 
Jul 29 2018,positive,tom was increduable the casting was great  must see film
Jul 29 2018,positive,quite a thrilling ride with healthy dosage of humor cruise and team worked hard and it really shows in the action scenes with the long helicopter chase one of its kind in contemporary movies the romace stuff felt funny and imposed but understandable the asian character choice clearly went to appease an asian customer base which was clever ending scenes were quite breathtaking supposedly in kashmir cruise did look a bit dated but worked hopefully he has a few more mis in him
Jul 29 2018,positive,yes its long yes its predictable yes its exaggerated but still a great action packed movie
Jul 29 2018,negative,completely predictable and boring one critic summed it best not one ounce of tension
Jul 29 2018,positive,alwaaaayyyssssss worth it for watchig tom cruiseloveeeeeeee
Jul 29 2018,positive,start to end thriller
Jul 29 2018,negative,actiongasim the plot was average and the action was beyond realistic even for this mass marketed franchise after the helicopter scene he free climbs up the mountain to stop the bomb no human in any circumstances can do this this movie lies more than trump
Jul 29 2018,positive,best movie of the summer
Jul 29 2018,positive,amazing loved it 
Jul 29 2018,positive,if youve seen one youve seen them all nothing really stands out on this one
Jul 29 2018,positive,our villain attempts to destroy the current world order because he deems it necessary to clear the board for a fresh start a new evolution sound familiar  mission impossible fallout is a roller coaster ride once again the mi franchise is feeling the jj abrams touch as part the bad robot production family there are plots within plots double crosses and triple crosses the core of this mission has tom cruise and the imf team shadowed by cia operative walker played by henry cavill superman a lot of the humor comes from this virtual male appendage measuring contest cavill is great at this  along with regulars ving rhames alec baldwin and simon pegg fallout is an mirogue nation reunion of sorts with the return of sean harris as villain simon lane and rebecca ferguson as mi6 agent ilsa faust this one has a great feel of the 19601970s tv series mif is also a movie post card of one of the most beautiful cities in the world paris france the valley in the kashmir doesnt look too shaby either directorcowriter christopher mcquarrie has made a tight fast paced movie the action set pieces are some of the best in the espionage action genre ever  your mission if you choose to accept it is to go see this movie
Jul 29 2018,negative,if i had never seen any of the previous entries into this franchise i might have been more impressed  this just felt like more of the samecue mission impossible theme see tom run see tom jump off buildings see tom ride a motorcycle see tom suffer horrific violence but recover within seconds  then have simon pegg put on a scooby doo mask and completely con the bad guys  make sure the bad guys you know the elite syndicate of global assassins stoop to every movie cliche in the moment of truth and sabotage their own plans  there should definitely be a scene where one of the good guys has a noose thrown around his neck and is hung up only to have his partner kick a box to him so he can stand on tiptoes while the fight continues on  and by all means set a 15 minute timer on the bomb and let us watch our beloved bomb defusing squad clip wires for 20 minutes  way too many played out aspects to this movie to stay invested  cant wait for the next chapter
Jul 29 2018,positive,thank you tom cruise you have done it again put simply the movie is just a ton of fun and provided one of the better times ive had at the movie in many years
Jul 29 2018,positive,tom owns those motorbike scenes
Jul 29 2018,positive,move over 007 thats ethan hunts chair now
Jul 29 2018,positive,this is why i go to the movies
Jul 29 2018,positive,yooooo great movie and i love how they tied every o e of the movies i to this one
Jul 29 2018,positive,exactly what you expect from tom cruise this movie is action packed eye candy 
Jul 29 2018,positive,tom cruise shows that it can be more and more impossible mission impossible  fallout  is more intelligent and more elaborate it does not delve into what we have not seen yet but it can be impossible from start to finish it becomes complicated in a few points but it concludes very well
Jul 29 2018,positive,it was non stop action entertaining
Jul 29 2018,positive,loads of action definitely a worthy installment to the series 
Jul 29 2018,positive,with a 98 rt rating i expected a great movie when i went to see mission impossiblefallout this afternoon what i didnt expect was to watch my now favorite movie of the year and possibly the greatest action movie ive ever watched the action is amazing with lots of laughs but i have to tip my hat to tom cruises stuntwork the man is simply fearless absolutely loved this film
Jul 29 2018,positive,lets just keep this simple everything about this movie is perfect i was undone put back together and wrecked all over again multiple times this is the new benchmark for summer action movies
Jul 29 2018,positive,fantastic  solid performances all around  i only had a problem with a few scenes i feel these moments could have been written better and that  these agents who plan very elaborate schemes but then ultimately lose an important item because they leave it sitting out in the open completely unattended  asking to be stolen
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of the best in the series i love the fact that tom does most of his stunts if not all which is even cooler  a must see movie  
Jul 29 2018,positive,although i saw both twists coming one really early on it was still a really good movie the movies seem to be getting better as the squeals go along
Jul 29 2018,positive,greatest movie i have seen all year
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie well balanced cast and everyone had a significant part and played it well excellent followup to rogue nation loved vanessa kirby  badass rebecca ferguson was great not as kickass as last time  but great ensemble henry cavill is in every movie  does a great job  scenery stunts both fantastic solomon lane was brought back in the best way and it worked  we got to see him do some exciting moves saw twice might see again
Jul 29 2018,positive,wow im not a huge action fan but this was epic like top 10 ever up there with true lies watching it again
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of the best mi franchise movies love it i thought the beginning is a little slow but the 2nd half is beyond great with a good story go watch it
Jul 29 2018,positive,so much fun to watch each insane action sequence if only the script had lived up to that quality still it would have been fine but then they had to dip it in cheddar fondue at the end but yes i sat there mouth agape through each stunt scene after scene if a movie could be an extreme roller coaster this would be it
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie from start to finish  tom cruise still has charisma to pull off this character
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of the greatest action films of alltime
Jul 29 2018,positive,probably the best mission impossible movie in the series so far heck it might actually be one of the best action movies ever    story its very simple but honestly that is fine mission goes bad and could now lead to an even worse event involving nuclear bombs its very generic but the journey itself is full of twist and turns that manages to surprise you and keep you hooked    characters everyone from rogue nation is back except jeremy renner and it also includes angela bassett as the new cia leader and henry cavill as walker a cia assassinagent all of the returning cast do a great job but props to ving rhames as luther for giving a much different side to him in this film henry cavill is amazing as an counterpart to tom cruise ethan hunt which makes me feel like the moustache was worth it angela bassett on the other hand was very underutilised in this film which is a shame since she did good with the limited appearance she had in the film we get to see much more inside the mind of ethan hunt and we finally know a lot more about his personality which makes this film feel much more like a personal story which the other mission impossible films lack    music its by lorne balfe so of course its amazing    action some of the best action scenes in the franchise and of course tom cruise does it for real which leads to some great camera shots the bathroom fight scene with tom and henry was amazing with terrific choreography the halo dive was shot phenomenally  the motorcycle chase sequence was much more tense compared to the previous one and the helicopter scene in general was amazing while none of the stunts top that of the dubai scene in ghost protocol it was still almost as good and there are 34 of them in this film    overall this is no doubt one of my favourite movies of this year and is something no one should miss
Jul 29 2018,positive,actor choice 45  videography 45  special effects 55  music and background 455  action 9510  character design 12815  storyline 12220  final rating 5265 810
Jul 29 2018,positive,mi fallout was the best to date in terms of story and dialogues it was more solid the actions was superb until the helicopter crashestoo unrealistic for me the film was bit long especially in the middle section you get again a very long cruise running sectioni though it was funny at first but it was way too long the best acting comes from the villains the music was inspired from batman dk and mi and it was good resulti give it a 80
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of the most ambitious well directed well acted and executed action films of all time tom cruise deserves an oscar just from sheer intensity will power and professionalism not your average cgi bloated superhero film see it in imax
Jul 29 2018,positive,the franchise that never fails fast chases silly stunts triple crosses a new hot villainess and the masks are back even earns a few laughs poking fun at toms height running and stunting
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie  was full of action with great gut wrenching scenes
Jul 29 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is a great action movie with incredible cinematography and insane stunts and action sequences tom cruise stars as ethan hunt who is out to take down the apostles who are trying to detonate nuclear weapons to wreak havoc on the world the story takes a while to get going but the setup is important once it starts it rarely slows down as we see tom cruise jump out of a plane fight in a bathroom jump off a building crash a helicopter and many more crazy stunts and that is where he movie overwhelmingly succeeds henry cavill does a decent job as does the rest of the cast the score is fun and the plot is fine overall it cant live up to rogue nation or its own trailer but fallout is still a great entry in the mission impossible series
Jul 29 2018,positive,almost perfect the action is pure awesome tom cruise still has it if you love action spy movies go see this movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout nonspoiler review insane action sequences heart pounding close calls and witty one liners throughout everything you could hope for in a mi film and more i dont know how tom cruise continues to one up himself but he does and of course the supporting cast was great as always henry cavill was a very well placed addition i hope to see more like this from him outside of the dceu overall probably the most fun youll have at the movies this summer rating 8510
Jul 29 2018,positive,teeth clenching spectacular
Jul 29 2018,positive,non stop fun best movie of the year
Jul 29 2018,positive,the best action movie in a long time  great movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,i just went to see mi for the second time but this time i went to see it in imax it was really cool the stunt scenes are amazing tom cruise was brilliant the scenery was spectacular in imax and to know that they really filmed in these countries and it wasnt just digitally added in i enjoy it the second time as much if not more because of the imax screen  highly recommend seeing
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie actionpacked great acting with the incomparable tom cruise
Jul 29 2018,positive,it was an action packed movie from start to finish the last 30 min were nonstop intense action i highly recommend you view a behind the scenes on this movie so you can appreciate the stunts performed by tom cruise amazing what he can do at his age i hope hes got one more in him 
Jul 29 2018,positive,lots of action and fun enjoyed the movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,excellent action all the way though 
Jul 29 2018,negative,i never would have watched this if i had known alec baldwin was in it terrible decision to put him in it
Jul 29 2018,positive,another great mission impossible film stunning action scenes that make your stomach clench to view with memorable villians for ethan hunt and his team to face  a must theater watch
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie a thrill ride from beginning to end
Jul 29 2018,positive,absolultely fantastic this movie had so many twists and turns and kept me at the end of my seat every time i thought it was moving in one direction another was around the corner completely worth viewing and already planning to see this movie again
Jul 29 2018,negative,a storyline so convoluted and cruises continued poor acting can only be saved by action phenomenal action shots  so this is worth seeing once its on cable
Jul 29 2018,positive,fun summer action pic 
Jul 29 2018,positive,awesome movie love tom cruise and the whole cast go see it now
Jul 29 2018,positive,lots of action predictably unpredictable cruise doesnt age 
Jul 29 2018,positive,fantastic film tom cruise is a rockstar great direction  editing as well
Jul 29 2018,positive,i thought rogue nation would be the highest this franchise could possibly go i was wrong tom cruise is still a legend also this is the only cavill performance i thoroughly enjoyed so far
Jul 29 2018,positive,this was an incredible blockbuster will it change cinema no but i do hope other movies follow this one in quality and story
Jul 29 2018,positive,awesome movie so well directed with great action set pieces
Jul 29 2018,positive,we watched this on a 4dx screen and this made it a good film into an excellent film loved it
Jul 29 2018,positive,best mi to date great story with lots of twists to keep you guessing and the most amazing stunts ever i dont know how tom cruise does it but he definitely outdoes himself in this one  a must see
Jul 29 2018,positive,the best one yet excellent plot twists and  requisite car chase thru paris hitting every major site london scenes added bonus of alec baldwin getting stabbed
Jul 29 2018,positive,if you think of onscreen chases as being an art form in their own right i do then this picture certainly meets  perhaps even raises the bar the same cant quite be said for the storyline which seems a tad convoluted and lacking in resonance but hey its a summer blockbuster best enjoyed on the big screen
Jul 29 2018,positive,incredible movie thoroughly enjoyed
Jul 29 2018,positive,no matter what your opinion of tom cruise it must be obvious to most that he is one of the greatest action stars hollywood has ever produced  the commitment this guy has to bringing his audience the most spectacular stunts is second to none  this film is no exception with bone crunching fight scenes and 2 knuckle gnawing chase sequences one on a motorbike and one in a helicoptor   i only took note of this franchise from number 3 onwards when jj abrams company bad robot took over proceedings  the first 2 films no longer seem like they are part of the same franchise the style of both are very different number 3 has always been my favourite ghost protocol and rogue nation were both decent but paled in comparison to 3 which was mostly down to phillip seymour hoffmans excellent bad guy   fallout is now probably my second favourite and in some ways the story is linked to number 3 which is maybe why i enjoyed it so much  the usual supporting cast were good but the one new addition who stood out was henry cavill playing a brutal enforcer for the cia and superman really does pack a punch in this one  very impressed with this latest addition to the franchise
Jul 29 2018,positive,my review on mission impossible fallout    story  customary action packed plot race against time finding the missing plutonium explosives nothing complicated or head scratching moments except for few twists and turns that demands attention to the plot    directorial and acting department     christopher mcquarrie started off his career as a screen writer  one of his most popular works usual suspects which won him an oscar for best original screenplay this movie kicked off as a basic 33 pages of seeded script mcquarrie developed the script along side the production process and he is that capable there are many charactersbut would only like to discuss on ethan hunt aka tom cruise ilsa aka rebecca ferguson henry cavill aka august walker and julia aka michelle monaghan ethans char in this movie has layers he is dissolved into this game of imf vs cia vs rebellious groups to an extent that he suffers from ambiguity against his own morale whats right wheres the limit that has to be drawn and the anxiety attacks that he suffers worrying about the one he loves and them being in danger because of the kind of work hes involved in in short the movie revolves around ethans character which is him fighting against the physical world by fighting against his own consciencehere goes redundancy the love between ethan and julias characters is one of the most matured and well understood relationship ive seen in the recent times of cinema ilsa is nothing but a female ethan hunt apart from catalysing the plot she serves as a full circle in ethans personal life henry cavill hes just okay a decent foe    technical aspects     the color grading is more saturated in mi series gives that muddy feelaction scenes are spectacular  halo jumpa fuzzy ride washroom fist fightuninterrupted long take and well choreographed  bike chase in paris here i would like to heed the sound design especially in this chase scene tom cruise rides bike against the traffic you clearly hear the doppler effect you literally can hear blue shift compact sound molecules and red shift distant sound molecules and the same effect amplified when ilsa cruises through the closed pillared road on bike just spectacular and visually satisfyingeven during the halo jump scene when the lighting strikes the bgm goes mute    box office   its been 22 years since the first mi movie released 1996 none of the 5 movies grossed 700 million the maximum was made by mi4 690 million right now the franchise is worth 25 billion i am guessing this movie will end up making 750800 million total in its whole run at the bo
Jul 29 2018,positive,i havent seen the last 2 but this movie had a lot of action and twist and turns
Jul 29 2018,positive,fantastic movie great action mixed with suspense and twists this will be one of the best movies of the year i highly recommend it for fans of this franchise and for fans of a roller coaster action movie 
Jul 29 2018,positive,just got back from this one and we loved it nothing really new here but the good tried and true mi themes are all there long chase and shoot out scenes elaborate and complex story line twists and turns you never know who the good and the bad guys are tom cruise enjoys these movies and it shows henry cavill superman is very good and does some great stunts tome cruise does his own stunts and youll see one go wrong and the limp is not acting breathless conclusion as is the norm for mi movies ive liked them all and will go again in a couple of years to see cruise dont stunts on his walker very much recommended
Jul 29 2018,negative,what a disappointing mess overly complex contrived convoluted plot and nobody eats for 2 and a half hours is it too impossible for somebody to grab a bite made up for only by the  pigs surrounding me at the trough gnawing tubs of popcorn
Jul 29 2018,positive,tom cruise is phenomenal explosive movie action packed non stop all the characters were extraordinary not a single dull moment music and sound effects were mind blowing definitely a popcorn movie youre at the edge of your seat during the entire movie the best film of the year i definitely recommend watching it its always worth every penney watching a tom cruise film never a let down first of all die hard step aside because mission imposible fallout just set the bar high
Jul 29 2018,positive,excellent movie its was amazing scenes super i loved it first of all teams was do hard work its was brilliant movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,this was the best movie ive seen ever i cant tell you how many time i said wow  whoo right out loud i saw it this morning in 3d it was awesome i recommend you see it in the theater in 3d to get the full effect of it
Jul 29 2018,positive,greatest on of this series
Jul 29 2018,positive,excellent movie with nonstop action  great plot twists
Jul 29 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is the best on the saga
Jul 29 2018,negative,it was very very predictable the action was alright but not amazing all of the good buts were shown in the trailers a very forgettable movie nothing special as all of the review would have you believe
Jul 29 2018,negative,why do people like this  some good action but so much boredom
Jul 29 2018,positive,an excellent action spy movie  you think its a bit low on twists until a huge one very near the end  and even a pretty big fakeout      i highly recommend watching rogue nation before seeing it as it is sort of a sequel to that movie glad i did     all the stunts and action were top notch but it did sort of lack that one over the top stunt and true lies stills owns the best bathroom fight ever  the chases were great and there were some damned funny parts
Jul 29 2018,positive,great fx and acting for the genre was tip top plenty of action and story line was reasonably coherent if a little over complicated storyline could have done with some refinement and maybe reduced to 2 hrs in runtime however this does not take away from an entertaining and engaging action movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,excellent direction the story was really good best of all the action scenes were more thrilling than a roller coaster ride 
Jul 29 2018,positive,my favorite action movie of the summer hands down much more fun than the last mission impossible better than jurassic and incredibles 2  and i am not kiddingl if you like the franchise this mi is one of the better ones
Jul 29 2018,positive,im not a big mission impossible fan and saw this movie on family movie night due to lack of other options but i must say this movie was fantastic i totally recommend it to anyone
Jul 29 2018,positive,a great set piece machine mcquarries work on rogue nation was good but hes only improved his action staging and direction here
Jul 29 2018,positive,one of the best movie this year so far and tom cruise  no words for himjust watch
Jul 29 2018,positive,this latest mission impossible has a gripping plot that kept me and my adult daughter gripping our chairs throughput every bit of action on the screen cruise gave another intense and believable performance surrounded by his team members who kept the humor and drama at its highest pitch yet the writing the directing and acting were fantastic the addition of henry cavill added a dynamic new interchange that i loved it is the best entry in the franchises offerings ever
Jul 29 2018,positive,full of action and twist 
Jul 29 2018,positive,an entertaining action film full of marvelous stunts thrilling set pieces and exciting chase scenes  the story is the weak part functional and derivative but has plenty of double crosses and a world threatening scale to it  good use of light hearted moments and a strong supporting cast although cruise is the star of the show and in this case deserves it has he continues to dominate with his screen presence  overall it is great fun with a clever plot and fantastic action pieces
Jul 29 2018,negative,action packed with mostly bad acting
Jul 29 2018,positive,great ecape for 2hrs amazing stunts great cinematography see this on as big of screen as possible  story is well its mission impossible who cares   tom cruises dedication to stunts shows in this watching the behind the scenes on youtube and its not wonder why dude is a beast 56yrs old or something  damnvisuals are stunning    get another one into production starting monday must see in theaters imaxdolbyrpwxd what ever big screen  big sound format you can  this is why we go see movies in big theaters and i have a 15k home theater i may go see it again then buy it when it comes out
Jul 29 2018,positive,awesome set pieces insane stunts and cool action yupdefinitely a mission impossible movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,full review 
Jul 29 2018,positive,the set pieces are of the high caliber weve come to expect from the franchise and it ties nicely into previous episodes a nice change my problem is that the latest offers up really juicy plot possibilities time and time again only to reveal it was all a ruse or a dream or a fantasy and then settling for formulaic action tropes a decent entry and mcquarries direction is improving i just wish they had had the nerve to go down any of the darker alleys they passed during production
Jul 29 2018,positive,if you want to see some real stunts and not an entire movie comprised of visual effects this is the one to see great store line great action fun and kept my girlfriend and i on the edge of our seats
Jul 29 2018,positive,a simple story filled with thrilling action sequences which make you feel vertigo had a blast watching it
Jul 29 2018,positive,this is better than the other movies in this franchise except probably the first im giving it another star for vanessa kirby oh okay i gave it a four because of vk on another note fallout gives a whole new meaning to 15 minutes lasting a lifetime
Jul 29 2018,positive,best action movie of 2018 for me
Jul 29 2018,positive,after seeing it a 2nd time its even better after seeing it the first time i still liked rouge nation a touch more however after having calmed down from originally going in with high expectations and going in knowing what to expect the movie blew me away even after seeing it twice my palms are sweaty which only a hand full of movies have been capable of doing to me prepare yourself for one of the greatest action movies ever made topping rouge nation and ghost protcol fallout may very well be the best action movie ever made
Jul 29 2018,positive,stunts  clever  engaging   humorous
Jul 29 2018,positive,stuntsaction and a motorcycle chase twists and turns its all there we saw it in dolby thats the way to see this
Jul 29 2018,negative,so bored by tom cruise these days i wish this followed more like the original tv series with someone else taking the lead yes it has everything thrown in and its just boring and all been done before seems these trilogies are the only way tom can get a hit at box office these days so how many more must we endure
Jul 29 2018,positive,literally a cliff hanger 
Jul 29 2018,positive,this is a sixth film in this long running franchise and shill has a lot to offer pure action with a story line and turns and twists absolutely what you expect from ethan hunt right
Jul 29 2018,positive,so far this film is the best âmission impossibleâ movie iâve seen hopefully many more to come but as an actor myself they can have me take tom cruise place because heâs getting too old for the stunts and the series needs a fresh face now
Jul 29 2018,positive,the best action movie in history if there was an oscar nomation for best action film of the year this movie deserves it amd tom cruise deserves an oscar after his amazing performance
Jul 29 2018,negative,big cruise fan found the movie to be boaring more of the same we al saw again first part of second half you forget what the plot is about  complicated better keep it simple i think
Jul 29 2018,positive,best action movie of the year
Jul 29 2018,positive,runninglots of running
Jul 29 2018,positive,two words henry cavill 
Jul 29 2018,positive,it is rare for a franchise to improve in quality as the sequels stack up and yet this one does the filmmakers have really dialed in the formula the fake outs and masks the car chases tom cruise running yet always find a tweak to make it fresh im not sure how they keep topping themselves space maybe but they have yet again
Jul 29 2018,positive,amazing action definitively lived up to the hype hcavill was pretty good the bathroom fight scen was particularly awesome even with having seen some via trailer very impressive and kick a scene for all actors personally i enjoyed mi5s comedic nuances and little callbacks to the original mi scenesstyles more than the attempted gravitas into ethans fears in mi6 the story itself at first seems to be taking the viewer through a maze and we anxiously await gasping twists and turns but the story seems to come up a bit short as if it couldnt decide where to turn  so just keeps sprinting straight through relying mostly on adrenaline vs the smart forward thinking gotcha control every outcome surprises those gotcha moments still exist in the film but not in satisfying crescendo that we have come to love from mi franchise leaving the film to feel more like bourne movie than a miision movie but maybe mi felt like such foolery has been thoroughly played out and the film just wanted to show us ethans determination and personal drive is what saves the day bottom line excellent action movie extremely satisfying and exhilarating very impressive and admirable fight scenes and stunts opting for action adrenaline more than clever suspense  surprise
Jul 29 2018,positive,this movie was pure adrenaline loved every minute
Jul 29 2018,positive,wow tom cruse did it again he never stop surprising us he was awesome he is one actor that keeps getting better and better every movie he makes 
Jul 29 2018,positive,full of action story and such smart twists although mission impossible fallout is an amazing addition to such a strong franchise it is also full of cliches
Jul 29 2018,positive,the best mission impossible movie one couldnt predict the twist turns and stunts other franchises loose steam such as fast and the furious and jurassic park movies but this franchise is the exception and this movie is exceptional
Jul 29 2018,positive,this movie has it all action story humor heart tension globetrotting cinematography crazy stunts good villain teamwork and ties all the previous mi movies together best one of the series
Jul 29 2018,positive,mission incredible
Jul 29 2018,negative,boring and unsuspensful rehash of hundreds of movies that came before it
Jul 29 2018,positive,amazing film ive always found some enjoyment from the mission impossible films but this one has more roots in its tv show predecessor its about teamwork deceit and subterfuge within subterfuge what stands out the most with all tom cruise films is not just his performance i always liked his acting but the action pieces they are so good that they almost hurt and set you on edge with the more extreme stunts henry cavill and his moustache are a great addition along with the rest of the usual suspects ving rhames simon pegg etc this has got to be the best one since the first mission impossible
Jul 29 2018,positive,tom cruz and henry cavill are great in this movie and i have to admit that there chemistry are pretty good getting to see them go toe to toe it makes it better for the movie benji should do stand up because he always makes me laugh in all mission impossible film 
Jul 29 2018,positive,movie was fantastic tons of action and the action sequences were well done the only negative i would give is a weird scene where alec baldwin gave a cheesy dying performance tom cruise was on point and this is probably the best mi of the series definitely see it in the theaters
Jul 29 2018,positive,the helicopter scene at end was too over the top for me the burnt tape was very nostalgic
Jul 29 2018,positive,just saw this we felt it was very overrated and a bit ridiculous the only it get 3 stars is because it kept our attention the entire time so thats worth something 
Jul 29 2018,positive,yup  they nailed this one im a medium fan of the series and a big fan of this one its a great ride  enjoy
Jul 29 2018,positive,excellent movie worth watching  thumbs up
Jul 29 2018,positive,3255 stars    there are a number of great sequences here  the martial arts fighting scene near the beginning is one of the bets martial arts scenes ive seen in a very long time  the carmotorcycle chase through paris is pretty intense  and the helicopter chase scene is pretty good too    in between these scenes the movie drags on just a little bit  the movie probably could have been trimmed by 2030 minutes to make it tight   but it never feels too long    the twist on the bad guy felt predictable from the start but there are lots of other twists and turns that are well done    overall it was enjoyable and fun to watch and a well done action flick
Jul 29 2018,positive,great movie this is what action movies should be
Jul 29 2018,positive,good in the same way that all the previous mi movies were but very predictable having seen all the previous mi movies knowing that none of the main characters could get killed off stole all the suspense from the movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,what an amazing movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,the mission impossible team never fails to bring tension excitement and entertainment every bit is far fetched but it all works kudos to cruise  co they are still at the top of their game 
Jul 29 2018,positive,it delivers what it is supposed to deliver but maybe too many of the usual tricks that make it a recognizable mi film and thats why it felt way too long to me and a bit boring
Jul 29 2018,positive,easily the best mission impossible yet
Jul 29 2018,positive,well slap my pickle this movie made me want to be henry cavill tom cruise great as always and the theater actually treated this movie like a marvel movie clapping at dope scenes and gasping at the actual cool stuff and had fun with it
Jul 29 2018,positive,it was very entertaining
Jul 29 2018,positive,highly entertaining best action movie in a while
Jul 29 2018,positive,exciting entry in the franchise that delivers some of the series best set pieces along with adding a deeper story and some fantastic villains  tom cruise continues his intense run as ethan hunt and allowed to give him some extra shades this time as he starts to question how far he is willing to go to win  he gets great support from the rest of the cast with new addition henry cavill bringing nice physicality and menace as cia operative walker in a nice twist cruise lets cavill even physically tower over him  behind the camera christopher mcquarrie crafts a slick fastpaced thriller with some of the best action sequences of the series from bathroom fights to the helicopter chase made all the more brilliant by being done with practical effects often with tom cruise front and center seriously this is proof the man is really crazy  best of all a more personal story is added to ethan hunts character who begins to questions the choices of his past while delivering some grade a villains sean harris returns as solomon lane but is far creepier and more interesting this time  overall probably the best entry in the franchise to date

Jul 29 2018,positive,wow mission impossible fallout is the best action movie i have ever seen and one of my favourite films of all time despite having the same director as the last one rogue nation fallout has a very different tone the story feels more serious and the stakes are the highest they have ever been the cinematography is incredibly beautiful every scene was shot perfectly with smooth wide angles the action is intense and heart pounding every stunt had me on the edge of my seat as i was marvelling at tom cruise every character has their moment to shine and henry cavill is an absolute badass it doesnt get better than this rating 1010

Jul 29 2018,positive,taut action scenes specially from cruise himself with some stunningly orchestrated stunts engrossing plot from the start to the end with some comic moments interspersed at the right moments granted there are some overboard overexaggerated superhero moments but in the end it is good entertaining spygame stuff for the weekend
Jul 29 2018,negative,oh dear god can we have an action film thats not totally void of any intelligence first it is still slightly entertaining due to characters likeability and action but the story makes zero sense  full of holes and too long  but the climatic action sequence is the ultimate of stupidity spoiler 15 min bomb timer lasts at least 45smg i was laughing out loud throughout that timewait for dvd or tv  mi 3 is still the best of series hands down positive its better than equalizer 2which isnt saying alot 
Jul 29 2018,positive,dont just read reviews do yourself a favor and see this on the biggest screen possible one of the best theater experiences you can ever have
Jul 29 2018,positive,yeah this franchise still has it alright and by it i mean nonstop thrills superior set pieces and stunts that exist without equal and enough fun and surprises to keep you hankering for more i still feel as though this was missing one or two signature mission impossible moments ie the kremlin hallway scene from ghost protocol or that server pool deep dive scene from rogue nation but even if the brunt of this installments action came in the form of set pieces ive technically seen before in other movies a motorcycle chase a foot chase a fight in a bathroom etc these are still some of the best attempts at the kind of set pieces in question a real solid action movie  the best of the summer for sure
Jul 29 2018,positive,this is a good movie and various emotional that very very good cool movie
Jul 29 2018,positive,action packed all the way through best in yet
Jul 28 2018,positive,fun and fast moving though 212 hours it does not seem like it the story was plausible the action breathtaking at times and overall super entertaining fallout is probably the best mission impossible movie yet
Jul 28 2018,positive,best in the series by a long shot 25 hours of awesomeness
Jul 28 2018,positive,i watched this in imax and it was crazy this might be the best one in the franchise so far
Jul 28 2018,positive,very impressive no doubt the greatest movie of the year 2018 dont miss it
Jul 28 2018,positive,its always a pleasure seeing our beloved tom on the big screen still doing his own stunts and all the film is action packed as usual and it covers all the grounds from motorcyclecar racing in paris to cliff hanging in the himalayas or so it could have ended with a skiing shootout but it was elicopters it features the most convoluted plot in the history of film but dont worry it clears itself out once all the bad guys are dead 
Jul 28 2018,positive,some moments of dialog malfunction but the action was great with some amazing cinematic moments best seen in imax
Jul 28 2018,positive,unbelievably epic jaw dropping stunts riveting high octane nonstop action tom cruise  team deliver insanely fun escape must see movie go nowdont wait
Jul 28 2018,positive,best one in the series watch it in 3d
Jul 28 2018,positive,great action  excellent special effects  difficult to follow the plot line  some scenes frankly were overacted  a little derivative
Jul 28 2018,positive,top notch  this should be the standard for all future action films  i never thought i would say a bathroom scene was a highlight of a movie  this is the most excitement you can possibly pull out of an action movie and it all works      there are some predictable moments but they are thrown in with enough unpredictable moments that you find yourself eventually second guessing yourself so you are never really entirely sure    the scenery is beautiful the locations are great and the film is be the best of the year
Jul 28 2018,positive,exelent movie from the start till the end   must watch
Jul 28 2018,positive,this movie was great great storyline great acting some twists and turns i wasnt expecting 
Jul 28 2018,positive,totally in to this movie from start to finish great story believable action all the actors delivered excellent performances and the females in this movie were especially excellent highly recommended 
Jul 28 2018,negative,an ideal action film for todays adhd instant gratification culture mission impossible  fallout satisfies the bare minimum plot  character necessities that its target audience requiresnamely that any scenesactionsdialogue that follow each other sequentially no matter how incongruous tonedeaf or plain silly constitutes an acceptable narrative    the problem with a film such as this one that is in essence an action sequence bukkake is that no matter how elaborate or wellexecuted those sequences are there are so many of them piled one on top of the other with nary any logic behind them that they lose any sort of dramatic oomph that they might have otherwise carried in a competently plotted and written film
Jul 28 2018,positive,so great 25 hours of action great story line too fun awesome movie overall
Jul 28 2018,positive,good movie a little too long
Jul 28 2018,positive,tom cruise missiles series the best franchise series

Jul 28 2018,positive,my favorite one of all  loved this
Jul 28 2018,positive,to me this movie is basically perfect mission impossible im someone who held mission impossible 3 as my favorite for a long time and this movie feels like the perfect way to end the overarching story theyve built with these characters since that movie on top of that it feels like a nolan directed mi movie with the way the action is shot edited and scored im a little worried about 7  8 as i felt this was the perfect ending but im hopeful
Jul 28 2018,positive,best mi yet stressed out
Jul 28 2018,positive,quite possibly the best of all the mission impossible films in my opinion no cliché action scenes and the plot was full of unpredictable twists and turns this is what a summer blockbuster should be

Jul 28 2018,positive,excellent movie lots of action
Jul 28 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout cements tom cruises franchise as perhaps the only cinematic series that gets better with each instalment and christopher mcquarrie delivers an intriguing engaging and harrowing espionage story as the backdrop for some truly breathtaking and genuine action sequences ever put to screen 
Jul 28 2018,positive,pure actionnothing but fun
Jul 28 2018,negative,as bad as mi iiterrible dialogue zero character development unoriginal plot obvious twists i expect better from this franchisethe last two were brilliant and this was just so disappointing

Jul 28 2018,positive,fantastic movie amazing plot cast and stunts of course it amazes me how these movies are able to continually get better and better its cruises stunts though that truly make the movie bettet
Jul 28 2018,positive,good exciting film if far fetched like normal best part alec baldwin dying now we dont need to see him bringing the franchise down further
Jul 28 2018,positive,best movie off the series if you like mi you wont be disappointed 
Jul 28 2018,positive,amazing action regardless of the storyline you are invested because it is executed so well
Jul 28 2018,positive,this movie was amazing     cast and acting  amazing   plot amazing     the only thing was the picture was grainy and it was kinda blurry also many of the times they got the lights in the frame it had that odd shine you dont want  otherwise this film was amazing
Jul 28 2018,positive,just another top notch actionpacked entry into the mi world  talk about manufacturing tension and anxiety

Jul 28 2018,positive,knowing that tom cruise performed all of his own stunts made the hair on the back of my neck stand up as i watched the stunt sequences wow im sure the fear on his face during the stunts wasnt acting very good actionspysuspensepopcorn flick it met my expectations for a good mission impossible movie wow again
Jul 28 2018,positive,tom cruise has done it again what a great action packed movie mission impossible  fallout has returning faces and a couple of fresh ones the storyline is solid and the action never stops one scene makes me think of the movie true lies go see this movie and you will understand

Jul 28 2018,positive,wow best mission impossible of all time definitely one of the best action films ever incredible cinematography beautiful locale insane stunts and keeps you on the edge of your seat
Jul 28 2018,neutral,phoned in like an amusement ride youll get your moneys worth in stunts and special effects mcquarrie always backs away from potential wittiness in order to preserve the tom cruise image a product like the other products
Jul 28 2018,positive,there is never a moment where this predictable movie feels fake its all real
Jul 28 2018,positive,the mission impossible films have once again continued the consistent streak of greatly improving with scale action tom cruises insane stunt work and pure aweinspiring spectacle with each entry making it easily the best current running action franchise today by far final verdict   masterpiece  one of my top favorites

Jul 28 2018,positive,love the movie saw it with my friend it was awesome 
Jul 28 2018,positive,kick movie we loved it found myself holding my breath for felt likehalf the movie lots o action
Jul 28 2018,positive,i love the mi franchise but have to say this was my least favorite of the mi movies the plot was more complicated than it needed to be and the dialogue was not as clever as it has been in the other mis tom cruise is still one of the best action stars around and the stunts are great so worth seeing on big screen just go i with lower expectations and youll enjoy
Jul 28 2018,negative,should have stopped after the first one
Jul 28 2018,positive,the mi franchise lives on as one of the best action franchises ever and fallout marks the pinnacle of the series for now anyway
Jul 28 2018,positive,two and a half hours of pure enjoyment there wasnt much downtown between the action yet the storyline kept you engaged and excited to see what was coming next the long and flowing action sequences took you on a stimulating journey and never left you asking if that was it i saw it with movie pass but will probably pay to see it again on the big screen 20180726
Jul 28 2018,negative,tom cruise seems to want to pretend that ethan hunt is a superhero this movie will strain your eye rolling muscles
Jul 28 2018,positive,you went to a tom cruise movie you got a tom cruise movie not an mi movie his ego was on full display action sequences were the only saving grace here
Jul 28 2018,positive,absolutely the best one yet in the franchise one of those rare movies where youre not just watching a movie but you feel like youre experiencing it
Jul 28 2018,positive,the best of the franchise
Jul 28 2018,positive,possibly the best action movie ive seen the story is great as well do yourself a favor go see this movie with your friends 
Jul 28 2018,positive,adrenaline fueled action sequences and cleverly crafted narrative misdirects mission impossible fallout pushes the series to new heights in one of the franchises most alluring chapters
Jul 28 2018,positive,an absolutely amazing thrillride 
Jul 28 2018,positive,mucho action exciting and blissfully mindless entertainment
Jul 28 2018,positive,the best of the missions this franchise never disappoints
Jul 28 2018,positive,i found the movie very predictable i would have thought they would have put more imaginative plot twists in it still there was a decent amount of action so it kept my attention most of the time
Jul 28 2018,positive,if you had high expectations for this movie then you wont be disappointed with action comedy and suspense at every turn mission impossible fallout wins its mark as the best movie of the summer
Jul 28 2018,positive,a roller coaster ride at full speed with mostly big dips corkscrew turns and upside down flips taking your breath away almost every minute tom cruise just amazes with his very very dangerous stunts making the movie even more thrilling the music and sound effects were incredible especially at the dolby  theatre you might need a seat belt for this great action movie so buckle up and enjoy the ride
Jul 28 2018,negative,way too long recycled material  confused plot  boring
Jul 28 2018,positive,several times i had to make a conscious effort to readjust myself in my seat from constantly being tensed up its pretty amazing how seamlessly one action scene can pirouette into another without it becoming tired or getting to the point of ridiculousness there was one moment in a car chase where the music dropped out and the movie allowed the experience of following tom cruise weaving between cars to play out and i couldnt help but laugh in awe speaking of the music it was definitely minimal but effective the acting was pretty great as well and kept the movie going in the inbetween action scenes i suppose if i had to nitpick about something it would be henry cavills character not being too menacing he definitely seemed a lot more menacing in the trailer though his character isnt weak by any means
Jul 28 2018,positive,one of the best if not the best action flicks i have ever seen and i have seen a lot
Jul 28 2018,negative,seen it all before at least 10 times no originality in it at all
Jul 28 2018,positive,ok eye candy yes lots of car chases and bullets flying around yes lots of dead bodies yes romance you got it decent acting you bet nice cinematography cool vistas and enough tension that you find yourself forcing your muscles to relax check check and check so why only three stars the whole movie was based on one moment one moment where the hero makes a decision it wasnt the decision i had a problem with but what happened immediately after that hunt makes his decision and then walks away from the car no one would have done that  secure the package and then make sure that what you knew was the right decision  was actually that the whole freakin movie is based on that one second not only that but wtf was up with the plot the scene where hunt meets up in private with the cia director felt like a uh we gotta put this in moment after the movie had been screened and speaking of cia i know angela bassett can act but what the hell was that i didnt feel a word of what she said it was like i expected her to say just kidding nah man im just playing after every line and dont tell me that plot wasnt sort of confusing the decoy in the bathroom almost killed the guy he was supposedly decoying for what would have happened if he really did the whole back end of the movie would have been meaningless the 15 mins and if you saw the movie you know what im talking about literally went on for 45 mins real time the ending was so unlikely it really literally was mission impossible there are so many confusing questions in this movie to me i am obviously the idiot here because 224 of the 230 experts loved the movie its certified fresh what did i like the white widow venessa kirby youve seen her in the crown as princess margaret in the crown is a stud up and comer she plays a perfect villainlove interest she could actually be a bond girl that knows how to act also loved sean harris as crazy guy overall the movie is fun its a eye candy see it in the theater movie but 97 nah
Jul 28 2018,positive,we just saw this at cinemark xd in 3d and it was everything i thought it would be simply amazing they nailed it once again nonstop and thrilling all the way till the end epic
Jul 28 2018,positive,the action story and cinematography is unlike anything else ive ever seen tom cruise is a bamf
Jul 28 2018,neutral,so dissapointing the pace was all over the place so many cliched moment throughout the movie and the movie itself was half an hour too long
Jul 28 2018,positive,amazing how is tom cruise so good every scene left me on the edge of my seat
Jul 28 2018,positive,best one  mr cruise is great  many fantastic stunts     a long movie
Jul 28 2018,positive,right up there with infinity war deadpool and black panther for best movies of 2018
Jul 28 2018,positive,the action is oretty good but the plot gets really messy in the middle plot can be somewhat confusing but hey at least they are trying to be original
Jul 28 2018,positive,better than bond better than bourne
Jul 28 2018,positive,adding some epic new tricks to the franchises arsenal that work toward its evergrowing wow factor the 6th mission may not reach the franchises compelling character highs and the story is pretty much a bloated part 2 to rogue nation but it still has amazing camerawork and impactful action
Jul 28 2018,positive,in my opinion this is the best mi film to date they have refined there characters and really uped there game in the stunts there were only a few 12 parts that i think i saw cgi even though i know some of the effects had to be fake the stunts were real and even more fascinating then cgi stunts there were countless scenes that i physically reacted whether it was an insane carbike chase or revealing a clever twist this is an unforgettable movie and another marvelus page to the mi story
Jul 28 2018,positive,one of the best movies of the year highly recommend this movie go see it now
Jul 28 2018,negative,seen it all before and its way too long
Jul 28 2018,positive,this is a rare series it gets better with age if they can make it to mi8 that would make tom cruise the greatest action hero of all time
Jul 28 2018,positive,wow the only word for this movie the franchise has to continue for many years as long cruise still acting
Jul 28 2018,positive,probably the text book action movie not just because it has great action but also because you truly care for characters involved and that is what raises the stakes and outcome more satisfying
Jul 28 2018,positive,another great mission impossible it keeps you on your toes at one point i thought the movie was going to end and be continued lot of actions love the motorcycle scenes 
Jul 28 2018,positive,great addition to the franchise  definitely ranks as 1 or 2 alltime
Jul 28 2018,positive,as a fan of the original tv show i get the premise of the team and what they do  its not called mission plausible or could be  its impossible  it you expect closer to reality this may not be the show for you  its not a chic flick  there was a couple of scenes where many in audience broke out laughing not because of the comedy intent  it was the absurdity of the action  i loved it  my wife not so much  the acting was good and cruise did a good job  be advised
Jul 28 2018,positive,so far this summers action and adventure films have been very boring however mission impossible  fallout is far from boring its full of adrenalinepumping action i believe that this is the best summer action  adventure film of the year and the best mission impossible film to date    in this film we see ethan hunt tom cruise as he receives a mission he chooses to accept but fails to complete because of an ambush as a result ethan and his imf team must work together with the cia and other familiar allies to stop solomon lane sean harris john lark henry  and his group known as the apostles from trying to execute a nuclear threat to the world    what i really enjoyed about this film are the sound designs stunts plot cast and all the mindblowing illusions imf uses to trick the bad guys i must say the sound design is fantastic the audio for explosions and gunshots sound authentic it sounds so real that i felt as if i was in the scene the stunts are intense because if you dont already know tom cruise does all of his stunts when he performs them it is hard to watch since he jumps off of many things such as planes and buildings i felt so nervous that these stunt are real the stunts are so nerve racking because most of the movie isnt made with cgis so most of the stunts are done exactly how the movie shows it the story is very interesting i like that you really dont need to see the other films to understand what goes on in this one    the cast overall is superb simon pegg and ving rhames are excellent as the imf since every delivery is spot on i like that benji is the most nervous character and you feel what he feels when a dangerous event happens also i enjoyed the performance of sean harris who really brings in the mystery of this character since he doesnt speak a lot until the end of the film rebecca ferguson as ilsa faust makes a great curious assassin since she always goes the opposite way of the imf and always finds something different and important which helps the imf also angela bassett and alec baldwins performances as erica and alan are fantastic i like how their relationship is shown as contradictors because they both argue their own points it is a shame we dont get to see more of this in the film henry cavill as august walker is also fantastic i like how ethan and august have different ideas about what they should do in the missions and they both try to incorporate their ideas but those ideas come at a cost    i really like how each scene feels more intense than the last scene at one point i thought that the movie was going to end a certain way and i was so nervous about what was going to happen that i almost fell out of my seat finally what i extremely like about this movie is the tricks the imf use to trick the bad guys in certain scenes i was surprised that it was an illusion my favorite illusion is the masked one where benji wears a mask that allows him to look like anyone    this movie had a lot of great things going for it the only thing i did not like about it is that it shows way too much in its trailer however it is fantastic i give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to people who like action  adventure and thriller movies i recommend it gor ages 13 to 18 as well as adults    reviewed by ryan r kids first film critic for more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org
Jul 28 2018,positive,mission impossible six a lot of things are falling upon us this summer from jurassic parks fallen kingdom to mission impossibles fallout  good news in this case the latter is way better than former you can read my review of the fallen kingdom down below mission impossible is one of those series that has somehow managed to not fall apart at the seams despite the many sequelsin much the same manner 007 james bond films do arent we grateful mission impossible films never seem to disappoint and neither does fallout the action suspense and even some emotional elements are amped up here in fallout it is as if the series took a 5hour energy binge and you might feel like the movie was 5 hours long but you wont mindyoull be glad my favorite mission impossible films are mi1 mi3 and ghost protocol it is too early for me tell where this one fits in the running but it still doesnt beat those three for me the first film of course is your first love you cannot deny its charm and its first kiss you had such great characters played by the likes of john voigt vanessa redgrave as max and others it was superb spy adventure bliss mission impossible 3 was great because of the new additions and great use of the following elements simon peg and jeremy renner the face rendering technology and the amping of action the humor high tech and ramping up of action made those two films         fallout does not disappoint either far from it there is an uptick with the action suspense and twist and turns that keep you wanting you more im not exaggerating somehow they managed to do it even if at times they sacrafice believability  it is on a level that is greater than other films in the series in this regard when you think you have seen it all you will find yourself admitting you were wrong there are some real gasping nailbiting and jaw dropping scenes too fallout director christopher mcquarrie who directed rogue nation is back and he brings in some elements we arent used to references and characters from prior films and even more encounters with hunts estranged wife these are very pleasant if not heartwarming surprises that none of the other films have there are scenes with helicopters and mountain ranges that are memorable in their own right who knew you could do all that with a helicopter but you will be wincing more than once  nevertheless there is one small drawback here all these elements with the increase in action and twists did not leave the film with much room for humor the humor comes in the second half of the film and fell a bit flat for me i will admit some others in the theater did laugh out loud but i didnt our two adorable modern day laurel and hardy agents played by simon pegg and ving rhames are largely absent in the early portion of the film until about the middle when they are back their humor is mediocre jeremy renner isnt present at all he was on the avengers infinity war set the absence of the three of them in the film is noticeable we are used to them being there since the start of mi 3 and as intense as the scenes are we need their humor and partnership there is too much high stakes running for the humor to have time to land and when peg and rhames do rearrive the humor dribbles in here and there another small drag on the film is some believability we all get that this is fiction but the amount of physical running we are supposed to believe hunt does in this film with leaping over buildings like spiderman all the way across town goes way beyond what any of the other films do when theres a lot of action we are all too distracted to think about believability its easier to suspend belief because we are being wowed when all we are doing is watching tom cruise run through gorgeously filmed landscapes as cool as the backdrop is there comes a point where we arent distracted enough to ignore that no one but a superhero could run that fast that many miles at full speed and then leap over and through buildings it edges itself a little over the believability radar when there is not much else happening to distract us  excuse the pun but it appears and feels impossible however these two elements are a small nuance  it doesnt ruin the film nor make it impossible to enjoy but it doesnt make it the best either still another great installment in a rather lack luster summer season with dinos for sale at auction and mutant shark named meg swimming about theater waters this film is a muchneeded thrill and delight   the story starts us on a mission that ultimately fails to retrieve the intended item because hunt decides to save one of his crew instead luther play by the incomparable ving rhames he is as much a staple to the film as tom cruise himself when things amp up about the failure of hunt at retrieving three plutonium orbs hunt takes things into his own hands once again while the cia questions his loyalty and motives thus soon hunt is being hunted and watched by the cia through agent august walker played by the mouth watering henry cavill  despite saving his life august clearly has other motives that arent seen readily  meanwhile hunt is on a chase for an old enemy from rogue nation solomon lane august walker and the cia have their own interest in lane as well lane is an exoperative who became an anarchist imprisoned and tossed around from government to government since the last film lane is somehow hoping and manipulating things to happen so that hunt is forced to get his hands on him hunt hopes by capturing lane that he can stop a new league of terrorists called the apostles who lane has spearheaded however lane is blinded by an apocalyptic ending for himself and hunt the apostles just merely want to end the world system through nuclear explosions pick your poison hunt has to deal with them both if he wants to save the world its a triad of dangers when you throw in the cia which intersects ethan hunt everywhere he goes hunt and his team are on a race against time to prevent a global catastrophe but they get far more than bargained for in this one this mission once again tests them all to the limit yes even further than we have seen before in the series so far    see a further breakdown at my website gotwordsorg

Jul 28 2018,positive,tom cruise is master in his game
Jul 28 2018,positive,great movie up to about the last about 20 mins its like someone kidnapped the writer and finished the movie from about the epic hanging off the cliff pose if youve seen the movie you know what i mean to the end i let out the most appropriate but not so appropriate laugh at that moment sorry why over the top cheese for me after that it downward spiraled with sappy lines and bad acting its worth going to see but calling it the best movie of the summer is a stretch
Jul 28 2018,positive,amazing addition to mission impossible series tom cruise does it again running more in 2 hours than most do in their whole lives also supermans in this one so that makes it even better ethan hunt is the most badass agent of them all

Jul 28 2018,positive,guys you got to this thisthe best action movie this year it was awesomeguys you got to this thisthe best action movie this year it was awesome
Jul 28 2018,positive,theres an old joke first said about the original mission impossible tv series which asks how we can continue to describe the tasks undertaken by these heroes as impossible if they manage to successfully complete them week after week this question is even more applicable to the barely connected film series of the same name where the stakes keep getting raised the odds ever more unlikely and the risks taken even more ludicrous with every release with each film the mission impossible part of each instalments title seems to refer less to the adventure that the characters go on than it does to the challenge of finding a danger great enough to trouble our protagonist ethan hunt theres a famously impossible philosophical question which asks what would happen if an unstoppable force was to run straight into an immovable object at times the mission impossible movie series feels like an endless futile search for an obstacle big enough to finally stop or even slow down the unstoppable force that is tom cruise    cruise is something of a contradiction since he first appeared on screen as a young man his good looks natural charm and intense charisma made him in instantly recognisable onscreen presence by the time of the first mission impossible movie back in 1996 it felt almost as if he was perfectly designed in a factory somewhere for the sole purpose of being the flawless example of a modern day movie star however in the years which followed that metaphor felt a little too accurate as cruises onscreen perfection started to feel somewhat artificial as cruise aged his incandescent confidence ceased to be merely the cocksure attitude of youth and increasingly started to feel more like the vainglorious assuredness of religious fervour its no coincidence that this perception began to take hold around the same time as cruises involvement in the church of scientology started to become a subject of public discourse he is still obviously a major star and commands the screen powerfully but his attempts to continue playing loveable everyman heroes increasingly fall flat while many of his best roles have been morally questionable supporting parts if not outright villains think interview with the vampire magnolia collateral hell even tropic thunder directors of major action blockbusters arent always sure exactly what to do with cruise the mission impossible series alone has changed director along with tone and style no less than five times across six movies so far however the mission impossible films have started to become increasingly beloved by critics and audiences despite varying wildly in their casts plotting and the way in which they are executed the mission impossible films are all united in their fascination with the legend of ethan hunt often mistaken for a characterless cypher hunt is as alec baldwin calls him in 2015 rogue nation the living manifestation of destiny hunt is a force of nature hunt is a fucking madman but hes our madman the trailers shouldnt say tom cruise is ethan hunt because that would be redundant ethan hunt is tom cruise    and cruise as expected gives everything to the role the stunts in mission impossible  fallout are simply unbelievable cruise famously broke his ankle during production while jumping between rooftops and completed filming the scene before getting medical help but by the time that death defying stunt actually appears on screen it feels like a fairly regular everyday occurrence compared to the utterly insane risks already taken in earlier and later scenes its not just surprising that cruise managed to avoid injuring himself worse its simply staggering that he is still walking around and breathing after production on all this mayhem wrapped the most jawdropping of these involves hunt partaking in a halo high altitude low opening parachute jump to arrive covertly at a heavily guarded event all credit must be given to camera operator craig obrien who had to to not only follow cruise all the way to the ground but keep him in perfect focus the whole time while careening towards the earth at 180mph from the cruising height of a 747 the audience should be given oxygen canisters too just to keep them breathing while watching it    despite being the longest and probably the most convoluted in the franchise it would be an understatement to say that mission impossible  fallout moves fast having already established most of its main cast and their relationships in the previous movies it barrels straight into action stacking set pieces on top of each other and constantly moving forward at breakneck speed theres also a certain confidence to the directing on show which no doubt comes from christopher mcquarrie becoming the first director to helm a second movie in this series everything about this film is trying to be bigger bolder and braver than its predecessors case in point fallout is not just the only film in the series to feature dream sequences but has hunt vaporised by a nuclear blast terminator 2 style in one of them much like the fun if more lowbrow fast and the furious series the mission impossible films took until their fourth chapter to really feel like theyd found a voice they were comfortable with mcquarrie clearly understands how to deliver it exactly as audiences expect if there is a flaw to this its that the lack of a new hand at the wheel has prevented the film from having anything resembling a unique style or character of its own mission impossible  fallout feels much more like a direct sequel to mission impossible  rogue nation than a mere installment in a larger series almost all of the main cast of that film return and this one resembles it in plot character theme and style apart from featuring a final sequence that combines explosive spectacle with ticking clock tension better than any of the previous climaxes the biggest difference between mission impossible  fallout and its immediate predecessor is that it doesnt have as many moments of lighthearted humour to balance the constant gloomy shadow of shady espionage and doomladen terrorism    despite the twisty narrative full of betrayals warring agencies and double crosses there are no real surprises here and most of the major reveals are more likely to inspire shrugs than gasps there are nods to each of the previous films in the series though and there is a sense in both of mcquarries releases that he is using these films to try and reconcile the first four movies which often feel like they could come from parallel dimensions to each other into one coherent timeline    so what is new vanessa kirby appears as a secretive arms dealer known as the white widow a kind of younger sexier update to vanessa redgraves max from the first movie angela bassett plays erica sloane the head of the cia becoming the latest great actor to bring extra gravitas to the series by playing a disapproving authority figure but the new cast member who has gained the most press is henry cavill he plays august walker a cia assassin tasked with keeping tabs on ethan and his team to prevent them from yet again going rogue in the line of duty cavill is yet to convincingly display the kind of onscreen personality required for roles like superman which he plays for the dc extended universe but here he is mostly tasked with appearing like a massive human brick wall with a moustache at that he is perfect he towers over most of the cast and he somehow appears to reload his arms before charging at opponents like a solid iron battering ram also it is a luxurious moustache    the violence in the film is one of its strong points the fight scenes are the best of the series so far and each punch or kick has solid weight behind it and lands with a visceral crunch however up until the films frankly brilliant final chasefightbomb diffusion sequence there isnt that much sense of real human peril sure the action sequences are excellent shot with clarity and vision and keep you on the edge of your seat with ingenious reversals of fortune however although you are often left wondering how the characters could possibly get out of their predicament you never really feel that this time they simply might not and that ultimately is the films biggest weakness theres a running joke throughout the film where characters are asked what their plan is and they can only reply were working on it suggesting that they are simply winging things half the time and hoping that luck will carry them to safety by this point ethan hunt resembles the bumbling overconfident parody spy sterling archer as much as he resembles the suave james bond type unfortunately their confidence is contagious leaving you with a certainty that things will somehow work out in the end    like its lead characters mission impossible  fallout is running at full tilt creating startlingly smart and confident solutions as it goes its a ballsy efficient and powerful piece of action filmmaking that understands how to build character and forward plot while on the move it supplies truly outstanding whiteknuckle thrills and just enough spy intrigue to keep things interesting in the downtime however it still cant quite complete the impossible mission of making you truly emotionally connect with these characters enough to fear deeply for their safety    from mogulamania  
Jul 28 2018,positive,splotionscheck  mask wearing triple crossescheck  last second countdownscheck  tom cruises advertion to wearing motorcycle helmetscheck  questionable physics check  improbable coincidencecheck  and most of all tom cruise running and running and more runningcheck check and check

Jul 28 2018,positive,today i went to the movies waiting for se  mi 5 part 2 a really funny movie but instead i see a drama movie a little bit more daker with one more time tom running and in a motorcycle i understand the writer main point he experimented to  give more time for every action develop in order to create a situation of suspense but it make the movie too slow for me and too many talking at least everybody have a lot of time the trailer spoil the character of henry cavill nothing importante and i still dont understand why he cannot just shave his mustache but anyway good movie good sound maybe the best ving rhames dramatic performance paris was beautiful one time but its looks bad a happy ending but my wife enjoy it more than many she also like more the jokes
Jul 28 2018,positive,best movie or the summer hands down 
Jul 28 2018,positive,christopher mcquarrie direction returns once again for a sixth entry in a franchise that continuously upgrading and exploring its potential keeps showing the masterful ability of tom cruise as an action hero without equal adding the always welcomed thrillingspyatmosphere enjoyably fun and entertainment characters and crafting an impeccable production fallout stands not only as one of the best installments in the series but also one of the best action films of the decade
Jul 28 2018,positive,i havent seen yet but my family wants see it and i cant wait
Jul 28 2018,positive,even though this was probably the worst written mi its still entertaining cruise is getting too old to do these physically demanding stunts for much longer so enjoy the noncomputer generated action while you can     plot holes everywhere but the fans wont care    for your 8 ticket youll get a dangling 1234 worth of entertainment
Jul 28 2018,positive,best mi movie since the second one  surprising better with a coherent story throughout and the typical over the top stunts  best action flick in 2018
Jul 28 2018,positive,you know what to expect when you go see an actionthriller in the mission impossible series  this movie will delivers on the action side but the 2 hours and 30 minutes makes it difficult to deliver on the thriller side
Jul 28 2018,positive,this movie was much better than i expected from the moment it started to the moment it ended  this movie was action packed cruise did an amazing job as did his costars there was plot twist after plot twist there were only a few things that i was able to guess the outcome of the script was amazing as was the cinematography the lighting the color the positioning  it was great this was definitely a must see if you enjoy a good actionsuspense film this is the movie for you 
Jul 28 2018,positive,the franchise gets better with each installment this one takes you deeper into the person of ethan hunt along with many plot twists the action was nonstop but had you grabbing your seat wondering why and how one person would sign up for that risk cant wait to see it again
Jul 28 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout was an actionpacked entertaining movie however it lacked the charm and charisma found in the rest of the mission impossible franchise
Jul 28 2018,positive,best mission impossible movie yet  tom cruise owns ethan hunt love it going to see it again
Jul 28 2018,positive,spoilersi was looking forward to this movie as it seems like the franchise keeps improving itself over time i was right as this movie takes whats great about rogue nation and amplifies it by 100 the action scenes and stunts are breath taking and stunning such as the helicopter chase in the finale and the halo jump at the beginning tom cruise gives the a more emotional performance as we see that he is not perfect and how throughout the movie he is making mistakes to show he is flawed we also get to see that he wont be willing to let a man die henry cavill was amazing as a ciaapostle and he really fought great the movie bounces all over the place and while that can be a good thing sometimes it feels too bloated but this film is an amazing piece of cinema and this the best mission impossible movie one of cruises best movies and performances and one of the best action films of all time
Jul 28 2018,positive,an incredibly fun and insane movie to watch with friends so far the best movie of the franchise thanks to the stunts and psychological mindfucked scenes

Jul 28 2018,positive,best film in the mi series
Jul 28 2018,positive,its twisty turny fascinating and picks up perfectly where rogue nation left off tom cruise is an absolute beast in this movie henry cavill proves his acting chops after his dc duds simon pegg and ving rhames are still perfectly cast as the rounding members of hunts team rebecca ferguson and vanessa kirby are stunning as the ambiguously motivated allies of hunt the action scenes are so tense and ridiculously insane and the finale is absolutely mindblowingly awesome the one problem i have with this movie is that one of my favorite characters from the last two movies william brandt jeremy renner is not in this movie and would have fit perfectly here as ethans ally yet foil but this movie does not suffer too much from his absence 99510
Jul 28 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an exhilarating action rollercoaster ride that leaves you spellbound with its thrill wit and intensity

Jul 28 2018,positive,started a little slow but really got moving eventually some really incredible locations and some of the shots they got of tom cruise doing something insane were really incredible
Jul 28 2018,neutral,overall a disappointment entertaining if you dont think too hard about all the convoluted plot points and plot holes
Jul 28 2018,positive,another fantastic addition to the mission impossible franchise the action was continuous and the story and plot twists were great too this is possibly the best movie in the franchise loved it
Jul 28 2018,positive,fun actionpacked and entertaining from start to finish mission impossible  fallout is an exhilarating entry in the longrunning franchise director christopher mcquarries followup to 2015s rogue nation is a thrilling film that improves in every way on its predecessor packed with plenty of jawdropping stunts exhilarating action and intimate character moments it delivers everything that fans could have possibly hoped for as far as the years actionpacked blockbusters are concerned they better suit up and get ready because its going to be an impossible mission to top this one
Jul 28 2018,positive,wow so good best tom cruise film since war of the worlds

Jul 28 2018,positive,mind blowing action with thriller
Jul 28 2018,negative,tom cruise obviously bought all of these good reviews this was the worst movie of the franchise awful
Jul 28 2018,positive,heart pounding edge of your seat action rebecca ferguson needs a spin off movie and fast
Jul 28 2018,positive,this is explictly outstanding having the actions too heavy in the movie the more tom cruise runs longer the hit it becomes the live actions is what most directors have been missing in movies these days cgi effects have their own place but why not try live action for once after all mission impossible 6 is an undefeatable action movie and hard to break the record
Jul 28 2018,positive,what going to the movies is all about definitely one of the best spy movies in nearly a decade the stuntwork and action sequences will definitely leave you wanting to see more cruise as always is a perfectionist and definitely one of the industrys best and knows how to entertain his audience must be seen on the big screen
Jul 28 2018,positive,completely ridiculous but a great deal of fun
Jul 28 2018,positive,a great action film
Jul 28 2018,positive,homage to the old tv series unbelievable amount of action has your heart the last 15 minutes cruise just keeps delivering and if rebecca ferguson doesnt become an a list actress after this something is wrong shes this generations grace kelly with the ability to carry action

Jul 28 2018,positive,very entertaining action packed from beginning to end was impressed with tom cruise and his physicality even at over 50 years old heard he did all or most of his stunts i know he did get hurt while filming this one movie lives up to what the mi films are all about 
Jul 28 2018,negative,yes there was a lot of action but when so many other action franchises are stepping their game up this one was pretty terrible not funny poor chemistry and an overall sense that everyone was over it
Jul 28 2018,positive,a great action movie that i thought hollywood doesnt make anymore 
Jul 28 2018,positive,great action flick tom cruise is a beast once again the realness of the action is as amazing if not better than usual thanks to tom cruise being crazy and doing his own stunts lots of amazing scenes with epic music i do think it has its flaws most notably a few cliched moments 2 viewings
Jul 28 2018,positive,wow the action in this is intense how he keeps doing those kinds of stunts blows my mind  best one yet and possibly one of my favorite action movies of all time definitely in the top 5 the score just amps up this sense of danger and dread throughout the big action sequences no one feels safe and the twistsspy stuff is also written pretty damn close to perfect find the largest loudest theater you can and go enjoy it
Jul 28 2018,positive,fiat olor bit puré action stunts are amaxing
Jul 28 2018,positive,by far the best mi movie yet and best movie of the summer amazing action scenes over the top of course but thats part of what makes mi movies so great tom cruise and rebecca ferguson were great once again 
Jul 28 2018,neutral,even many intense and actionpacked moments couldnt save this film from being a 25 hr waste of time the dialogue intrigue and real invention of the first mission impossible has never been duplicated fully in these films although i honestly thought 3 was pretty close and this film is just more of the same save your money and rent
Jul 28 2018,positive,action movie with a good storyactingtwists and no blurry camera shaking never saw any of the other mi movies but liked this one

Jul 28 2018,positive,another great action picture tom cruise at his best
Jul 28 2018,positive,as expected tom cruise and everyone else in the cast bring stellar performances to an action packed and well directed screenplay
Jul 28 2018,positive,excellent movie very entertaining i think this was the best one so far
Jul 28 2018,positive,tom cruise is the hardest working actor in history go tom
Jul 28 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout 5 out of 5 stars mission impossible fallout is an awesome exciting action packed sequel that shows tom cruise is up for more crazy stunts from jumping out of an halo plane being chased on a motorcycle in paris running and jumping on rooftops in london and flying an helicopter and being caught in a dogfight these movies get better through sequels and i am not complaining that they should stop each movie gets better and tops the one before fallout is probably the best one out of six movies now sure i find tom cruise climbing the burj khalifa to be the most intense stunt and the motorcycle chase scene in rogue nation to be well done and the best action sequence fallout in general has a lot going for it from a plot that has a lot of pieces moving with characters betraying another double and triple crosses with each other but it all makes sense in the end when everything is pieced together the plot follows ethan hunt tom cruise and his team benji simon pegg and luthor ving rhames are on a mission trying to retrieve stolen nuclear devices when the mission goes awry and ethan has to face the consequences of saving ones life over millions they are forced to have a shadow from the cia with august walker henry cavill tagging along with them on there missions while a terrorist group called the apostles are after the nuclear devices a lot more goes on with the plot which makes it better but the less you know before going to see it the better there are a few twists that will surprise you characters wearing masks and fooling the audience that will leave you surprised and a few triple crosses yes ilsa faust rebecca ferguson returns with her own agenda that may interfere with hunts mission the movie is loaded with action packed set pieces throughout i will consider this to be the best action movie of the year so far definitely a summer blockbuster type of movie while it is keeping you thinking and focused on its heavyhanded plot writerdirector christopher mcquarrie does well with topping each action scene over the one before that from a halo jump scene that is dizzying and crazy to a brutal fight scene in the bathroom at a club to a convoy breakout that leads ethan being chased by the police with more bad guys after him while faust is hot on his trail as well to an overlong rooftop running scene that shows tom cruise can jump and sprint for long distances then the climatic finale with tom cruise being in an aerial combat dogfight while flying a helicopter which is dizzying and thrilling but the best aerial combat scene shot on film tom cruise is at his best again henry cavill is a great addition as well playing a character that is hard to trust ving rhames and simon pegg are still good pegg having more hands on action this time rebecca ferguson is great playing a character that is difficult on trusting but has feelings for ethan while they have different agendas on their mission sean harris returns with that monotone voice but is still menacing alec baldwin was great too with having more confidence in ethans actions and choices even though he does not show it the music score lorne balfe was also good and helped create the tone of the movie which is a bit darker his score almost sounds similar to hans zimmer overall mission impossible fallout is a great film if you are into the series or not this film will definitely win newcomers the action sequences are top notch exciting and thrilling there is a lot of action from beginning to end the cast is great the plot is all over the place but works well with the twist and turns tom cruise is not holding back with stunts this 2 and half hour film does feel short when the pace flies so fast with its busy plot and non stop action you may finally catch a breath when it is over
Jul 28 2018,positive,perfect follow upaction up end to end adrenalin with great plot and stunts
Jul 28 2018,positive,suspenseful action packed  great story nail biter  deff a movie worth seeing  just when you think tom cruise is done he comes out with one more 
Jul 28 2018,positive,best one in this series
Jul 28 2018,positive,an epic roller coaster that will leave you exhausted in the best way possible
Jul 28 2018,positive,fastpaced intense and beautifully shot mission impossible  fallout continues to not only prove that tom cruise is the go to actor for death defying stunts but also that the mission impossible franchise isnt slowing down anytime soon

Jul 27 2018,positive,quite possibly the best action movie ive ever seen  fight me
Jul 27 2018,positive,crappy unoriginal plot terrorists threatening the world with nuclear weaponsbut admittedly one with a few good surprises esp the ending  the joy of this movie though is watching tom cruise doing all his own stunts some of which are very impressive  and there were a few chuckles watching alec baldwin get into a fistfight
Jul 27 2018,neutral,great action scenes as usual irritatingly recycled story  grab the package almost always nuclear of some kind save the friend imf is undermined bang bang boom cut the wire blah blah blah same old stuff this is as creative as we can get eh if you like consistent and reliable yet painfully stale action films go for it
Jul 27 2018,positive,thoroughly thrilling satisfying wellpaced wellcrafted insanely ambitious and incredibly successful privileged to have watched this great cinematic achievement

Jul 27 2018,positive,this is gonna be the action movie to beat for a while
Jul 27 2018,positive,believe it or not i think this one is really the best of all series nearly 2 and a half hours provided intense action sequences keeping tension and eyepopping tom cruise had a great energy and obviously did all his own stunt overall its fantastic the best summer action movie and indeed a lot of fun
Jul 27 2018,positive,loved it best one of the series i especially loved that they essentially tied together the entire series minus mi2 even with call backs to the very first movie all around great action comedy and twists

Jul 27 2018,positive,i have to say this was an amazing movie with integration of past movies stories it put it past ghost protocol as the best in the franchise i cant think of a better action movieever
Jul 27 2018,negative,oh wow a billion dollar gopro video
Jul 27 2018,neutral,so so slow start helicopters scene is a little much 
Jul 27 2018,positive,hands down the best mission impossible movie ever made its come a long way since the 1996 original and this one was well worth watching 
Jul 27 2018,negative,this so called movie was anything but remotely good the cheesiest lines seems as of it were written by a third grader the night before his homework was due i barely made it through this utter embarrassment so many cringy moments its hard to say what was the worst part the entire beginning the middle or the long lasting neverending ending waist of time but i had fun making fun of every moment  so there is that
Jul 27 2018,positive,the helicopter scene is way too fake and the idea of detonating a bomb is not exactly thrilling watching this at marco island was a boring experience since ana kept falling asleep i have not been enjoying this vacation the bathroom scene in paris was very gay an orgy like experience the scenes of paris and london made the movie seen like a virtual ride through 2 iconic european cities
Jul 27 2018,positive,incredible movie the stunts are just crazy hats off to tom cruise
Jul 27 2018,positive,what a ride the whole squad kills it henry cavill is great addition to the cast  when you think youve seen peak cruise he comes and he tops the expectations

Jul 27 2018,positive,one of the best action movies of the year and my favorite in this franchise  go see this one on the big screen
Jul 27 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout brought a whole new level of action and cinematography both amazing also not just good action and pace a good storyline with good characters and they ended the movie perfect like a mission impossible 
Jul 27 2018,positive,fast paced intriguing and kept me leaning forward in my seat the final battle scene grips the watchers attention as long as you remind yourself that this is not a realistic movie the action will leave you extremely pleased and excited
Jul 27 2018,positive,for a series where the same damn storyline keeps recurringthere is a global threat crystalized in some big bad antigod conveniently precarious objet a and in the course of preventing said threat from actually manifesting ethan hawk and his team must be disavowed their loyalties called into question before the true turncoat is revealed and the world savedthe narrative here is so full of genuine twists that even though you know where youre headed you never quite know whats around the next turn cruise is committed as ever to pulling out all the stops and stoping at nothing for seatgripping thrills and the movie benefits from having allowed his supporting team to slowly grow in number and character over the past few movies
Jul 27 2018,positive,best mission impossible so far the whole cast did great cant believe tom cruise keeps pumping out these movies and vanessa kirby oh my god need more of that as well as rebecca ferguson my new crush
Jul 27 2018,negative,this movie does not deserve a 90 its good but wtf peopleghost protocol one was better this movie was average 75 tom cruises stint were awesome as hell thought bravo
Jul 27 2018,positive,this film from nearly the start to the finish almost never let up on the suspense plot twists and action it is one of the most well shot directed musically scored and intense action movies i have seen in years this is the best of the mission impossible movies and one of the best action films ever made
Jul 27 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is a franchise saviour  hang on to your seats it is actionpacked thrilling entertaining movie of the summer the movie has many  decoys and sub plots and suspense  you will be not be disappointed mission accomplished by ethan hunt and the imf
Jul 27 2018,positive,loved it  great chase scenes and excellent story line
Jul 27 2018,positive,this is private information  if i tell you this is a good movie than the cia knows that this is a good movie look at the stars and and infer for yourself also i might be in love with rebecca ferguson
Jul 27 2018,negative,super mediocre where these glowing reviews come from i have no idea horrible bmovie acting no plot if you have a few working brain cells left dont waste them watching this trash
Jul 27 2018,positive,nothing super deep of course but if youve come for action super solid love how it was shot love the sfx love the fight and chase choreography its tough for these guys to come up with new material but it felt fresh the car chase and motorcycle chase scenes were terrific helicopter scenes were a little hokey but still okay loved how the original cast was still there henry cavill was an awesome addition he did really well this film definitely has high replay value
Jul 27 2018,positive,a thrill every minute  amazing helicopter scenes motorcycle scenes cars truck fun fun fun movie  loved it
Jul 27 2018,positive,the action was fun but the dialogue was an unforgivable cheese fest if you want to see it id say wait to rent it an hour too long and a messy overly cliched plot 
Jul 27 2018,positive,this exciting addition to the franchise gets a solid 45 icees out of 5  it has action twists great fight scenes everything youd expect from a mission impossible movie  the only thing that knocks it back is that some parts of it are just a little too predictable    newcomers angela bassett and henry cavill along with vanessa kirby add some good depth to the file but the cool thing about this movie is that it brings back as shown in the trailers rebecca ferguson as ilsa and michelle monaghan as julia i think mr hunt has a type just sayin  throw in an ample amount of ving and simon mixing in just a touch of alec and you have the whole gang  well except for jeremy renner which i missed not being a part of this one  i liked his character  oh well  interesting side note about jeremy  he wasnt in avengers infinity war hawkeye and he wasnt in this  i sure hope he didnt pass up roles in those two movies to be in tag  that would just be sad    anyways back to mi6  the stunts in this movie were incredible and even if some were done in front of a green screen they were still pretty darn good  there are some obvious twists that you see a mile away but some that come as a surprise  either way there are twists aplenty    if you are a fan of the mission impossible franchise you will thoroughly love this movie  if not well i still think youll like it    no scenes during or after the credits    enjoy
Jul 27 2018,positive,fantastic  what a fun movieso worth it
Jul 27 2018,positive,fantastic action fast paced tom cruise on the top of his game the ending is a shocker so good

Jul 27 2018,positive,prepare for 25 hr of non stop action awesome 
Jul 27 2018,positive,mission impossible is a franchise that much like its protagonist ethan hunt just doesnt quit while the first three entries in the film series ranged from alright to pretty meh the most recent three films have set new high bars for action films and have exhibited some of the most impressive stunts ever done for a movie ghost protocol and rogue nation are two of my favorite films and have showcased tom cruise at his best and most daring fallout continues this trend you would think that a franchise that is six films in would have started to slow down but mission impossible has impossibly kept the momentum and excitement with its most recent entry    mission impossible  fallout features the same actors and characters that have become familiar to fans of the series tom cruise is of course back as ethan hunt the skilled and seasoned agent of imf impossible mission force who has prevented worldchanging disasters more times than he probably ever wanted to cruise is somehow still at the top of his game in fallout and its hard not to respect the man for the dedication he gives to his craft as per usual the insane stunts that you see hunt perform in the film are done by cruise himself and this is something that continues to bolster the films alreadyincredible action shots of cruise piloting a helicopter through mountains jumping from a c17 or leaping across buildings look completely real because they are completely real even though hes getting old 56 years old as of july 2018 i hope he continues to do what he does for just a few more years    cruise is joined by many of the franchises recurring favorite characters ving rhames returns as luther stickell who is finally given more to do in the film and serves as a permanent member of the imf team of agents rather than as a brief cameo or supporting role simon pegg is back as benji dunn another imf agent and pegg does an excellent job again even though the writing dials back the characters humor this time around rebecca ferguson continues her role as ilsa faust an mi6 agent and love interest  of hunts and she delivers another convincing performance henry cavill joins the cast of fallout as well portraying a tough and burly cia assassin who is tasked by the cias director angela bassett to supervise the imf team every performance in mission impossible  fallout is superb and no one except for cruise really outshines the others this is especially important when considering the team dynamic in the film something that ghost protocol in particular nailed on the head everyone on the imf team feels as capable as the rest and each contributes their own unique skills and personality that make them compelling and worthy additions to the team    now lets get into the meat of the film the action the mission impossible franchise has always been about the highstakes edgeofyourseat nailbiting action this is something that fallout doubles down on and i can confidently say that it features the best action of the franchise ill even venture to say that it features some of the best action of all time its handtohand combat sequences are brutal the edits and camera angles bring out the force of every punch kick jab and block and the fight choreography is directed beautifully vehicular chase scenes are filmed in a way that you never lose track of where characters are in relation to each other and the landscape feels familiar and easy to follow gunfights are intense and made powerful by the sound editing and cuts the action is simply marvelous to behold and assembled masterfully by a director christopher mcquarrie who proves that he has harnessed his craft these scenes which are memorable to say the least have been replaying in my head over and over since i walked out of the theater giving me the urge to watch the film again    aside from the films stellar action the other aspects of mission impossible  fallout are great as well the writing is superb it fills the plot with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat and probably confuse you a bit it adds development to characters in ways that you wouldnt expect from an action film it also makes the most ridiculous things seem plausible and believable in the films context something i cannot elaborate on without spoiling things the acting as i already mentioned is topnotch and the entire cast contributes greatly to the movie the cinematography is excellent as well beautiful wide shots of cities mountains and landscapes are present throughout and the camerawork during the films most gutwrenching moments enhances the intensity and emotion    can i name any flaws with mission impossible  fallout i have one single flaw that comprises a single second of the film there is a single shot of computergenerated rocks tumbling over the edge of a cliff and this shot looked really bad like something out of a 1980s video game    thats it the only real flaw with mission impossible  fallout is a secondlong unfinished cgi shot you could argue that the films twists and turns that i mentioned could be too much or be too confusing but that is purely a preferential issue with the film and one that did not affect me one could also point out the clichéd lastsecond resolutions that happen a few times and the deus ex machina that is scattered throughout but i honestly thought these were handled so well in the script that they were not a problem at all    mission impossible  fallout is the rare action film that is smartly written beautifully directed wellacted memorable and an absolute joy to watch this is the first film i have seen all summer that ive loved and had no significant issues with without a doubt it is the best film in the franchise and one of the best action films i have ever seen and i have every intention of seeing it again buying it on bluray and convincing as many people as possible to see it this is a franchise that i hope continues to pump out excellent films as long as tom cruise is willing to work on them rest assured that you will find me in line to see it on its opening night whenever it is released mission impossible  fallout gets 5 out of 5 stars
Jul 27 2018,positive,favorite mission impossible movie maybe even favorite action movie  intense for every scene with great acting and amazing action set pieces i would highly recommend seeing it in imax
Jul 27 2018,positive,its hard to believe that this franchise began more than two decades ago  tom cruise once again excels in a role that he was well cast for  far more so than jack reacher  he is once again aided by a terrific supporting cast that has great chemistry  there are some thrilling action sequences here as well  though i think christopher mcquarrie has seem the 1993 sylvester stallone movie cliffhanger because i saw some similarities in this movies climax that reminded me of stallones action thriller  i was never bored despite the two hour plus running time  however there was one liability here  henry cavill  he just did not work for me in his role as cia operative august walker  also plottwists that were supposed to surprise the audience can be seen from a mile away  still i liked this movie enough to recommend it  if you want to see a great movie in this franchise go back to the beginning
Jul 27 2018,positive,this action thriller deals not not his abilitiesbut his much more personal issues of ethan hunt and became the best in the franchise till date alsoall time best action thrillers magnificent
Jul 27 2018,positive,i thought this was an excellent movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,excellent fast paced addition to the series  every expectation was hit out of the park  best movie of the summer so far
Jul 27 2018,negative,i have no idea how a movie with such a shallow plot even gotten 98  except for the amazing cinemotography incredible locations and great editing   the scrip was awful and shallow   the twists were too predictable   the action at times seemed unrelated to the story just for the sake of cruise attention and his abilities     some of the acting was poorly done especially the female cop say was that she looks like she is just smitten by cruise rather than acting her part     i could go on and on i think if the expectations werent set so high i wouldnt even bother with a review 
Jul 27 2018,positive,this movie was worth the mustache scandal over justice league
Jul 27 2018,positive,one of the best mission impossible movies highly recommended to be seen in imax cinema filled with action thrilling  breath taking scenes tom cruise keeps on getting better and better a definitely deserved 55
Jul 27 2018,positive,really well done great story  stunts 007 watch out imf hunt  team are here to save the day and get the girl

Jul 27 2018,negative,horrible movie  not worth it  slow impossible
Jul 27 2018,positive,on the edge the whole time i felt every line of dialogue for whats worth is the most different and original of the saga simply amazing and breathtaking 100 lives up to the hype ill see it again this weekend 
Jul 27 2018,positive,tom cruise deliver his strongest performance ever and the best movie of all the mission impossible franchise with an unstoppable action sequences a mind blowing script and unpredictible plot twists most of them i strongly consider this one as the best action movie in a long time since 007 skyfall  rebecca ferguson and henry cavill are the best supporting characters ever   the music was one of the greatest additions in this movie as well
Jul 27 2018,negative,well there goes the franchisehenry cavills acting and character are just simply crap  just another formulaic hollywood offering to appease the masses who are seduced by gratuitous special affects and constant impending periljust insulting to the audience  i would have walked out had it not been with my wife who tolerated the movie  not even close to goodreally disappointing
Jul 27 2018,positive,sure it has its clichès but it is an action film and an entertaining one
Jul 27 2018,positive,probably one of the best one out of all the mission impossibles 
Jul 27 2018,positive,the best of the mi series
Jul 27 2018,positive,this movie is simply a lot of fun no pretense no nonsense its just plain good best summer movie so far
Jul 27 2018,positive,the best of them all ill definitely see it again 
Jul 27 2018,neutral,same old plutonium deactivation at last second and saving the world i dont think tom cruise realize that its not 90s or 2000 anymore be honestly i dont feel anything new or interesting in whole 2 hours just another same old action movie made for tom by tom    pros   1henry kavil  this movie may help him to be next bond  2 nice camera work all around  3 tom cruise  even though he is 56 years old he still delivers the best like in his 30s
Jul 27 2018,positive,mi just keeps getting better best yet and i dont know if anything else can top this in 2018
Jul 27 2018,positive,fantastic addition to the mi franchise  picks right up from the previous film and adds a fresh emotional layer to ethan hunts character and story arc
Jul 27 2018,positive,awesome thats all you need to know
Jul 27 2018,positive,absolutely insane everything fires on all cylinders 
Jul 27 2018,positive,close between this and ghost protocol but undoubtedly the best movie ive seen this year tom cruise rebecca ferguson simon pegg ving rhames and all the rest continue to amaze
Jul 27 2018,positive,great movie with amazing stunts worth watching on imax tom cruise is one crazy dude
Jul 27 2018,positive,insane action and stuntwork should go down as one of the greatest actions films ever made

Jul 27 2018,positive,actions awesome and appreciated the plot twists that keep you guessing
Jul 27 2018,positive,well tom cruise knocks this movie into the top 3 of not he number one spot in action films of all time from the crazy stunts to the great story line and plot twists this movie keeps you on your toes the movie starts off running and doesnt stop till the end credits roll im not even a huge tom cruise fan this movie is just that good 1010 
Jul 27 2018,positive,enjoyed and loved alec baldwin rebecca fergusson ving rhames and simon pegg but i must be immune to only action  moved from one action shot to the next without much of a script
Jul 27 2018,positive,best sequence and very funny ever
Jul 27 2018,positive,insane action and i still cant believe tom cruise does all his own stunts whatever you say about tom cruise nobody can deny that he is a true badass action star wow

Jul 27 2018,positive,the greatest movie i have ever seen
Jul 27 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Jul 27 2018,positive,tom cruise gets better with age henry cavil played the bad guy so well that i actually hate him now high class action movie yet again from an unstoppable franchise 
Jul 27 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is another outstanding entry in this series expertly written and directed by christopher mcquarrie this is easily one of my favorite action franchises of alltime and fallout just may be the best action film in the last few years the story here is so thrilling executed so well and then topping that off with some of the best action and chase sequences recently seriously this films story is so smart  i love that about this franchise being a large summer blockbuster it doesnt just throw action at you for the sake of action you have to pay attention to the story every spoken line in order to follow along with the plot points there are so many surprises excellent twists and turns but wow the action in this the sixth film in this franchise is out of this world    perfect interactions between each character everyone is amazing here tom cruise as ethan hunt this man is still a monster what cant this guy do all of the insane stunts he does at such a fast pace top notch physical performance here of course ving rhames and simon pegg are incredible as usual but henry cavill i have a strange connection with i am not actually a fan of cavills acting as far as line delivery but his physical performance here is incredible his stunts performed as well providing some of the best action sequences in this film kept me on the edge of my seat
Jul 27 2018,positive,why are you reading this to see it
Jul 27 2018,positive,another fun entry in the mi series and at this point quite likely the best of all of them its still not perfect though the villains motivation is silly and generic and he is played extremely blandly by cavill we get a lot more characterization of the rest of the team this time though and i genuinely cared when they were in peril
Jul 27 2018,neutral,more twists in this plot that in a whole bag of twizzlers  it was an ok movie but about 40 minutes too longbut i used that  up taking a short nap
Jul 27 2018,positive,very good movie edge of your seat from beginning to end 
Jul 27 2018,positive,best mission impossible movie since the 3rd installment awesome action scenes and intensity tom cruise is the man
Jul 27 2018,positive,relentless action thats both fun and insane breathless entertaning entry in one of the best film franchises of all time
Jul 27 2018,positive,excellent movie  i was on the edge of my seat for most of it i would have rated it 5 stars but the plot was weak props to tom cruise for doing all of the amazing stunts himself that takes skill and courage all of the supporting cast was top notch and the special effects were exceptional well done
Jul 27 2018,positive,i love these films and this one was no different beautifully filmed and action scenes were not zoomed in so you cant tell whats happening my only issue was the story was a little weak but still an all around great movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,as silly as ever but you cant deny the spectacle theyre all looking very old though
Jul 27 2018,positive,loved it the best one so far i love tom cruise in this series but all of the main characters are really good
Jul 27 2018,positive,awesome movie on the edge of your seat the whole time
Jul 27 2018,positive,wow and wow it has been a while since i have watch a nonstop action movie with a good thrilling story and edge of your suspense all roll in one gotta watch it again
Jul 27 2018,positive,great action sequences mostly real and not cg plot around one girl elsa was a little rushed but the rest of the plot keeps the intrique up
Jul 27 2018,positive,best spyaction film ever made bar none epic in every scale imaginable this is why we go to the movies pure escapism in every sense of the word tom cruise jumping out of planes hanging off helicopters and injuring himself all for entertainment wow this man is a legend this must be seen in imax 1010
Jul 27 2018,positive,great action in general what a mission impossible movie should be 
Jul 27 2018,positive,whats done is done when we say its done
Jul 27 2018,positive,very good much action very boom boom pow shoot shoot xd
Jul 27 2018,positive,good but not great entertaining action but definitely had its share of cheesy moments 
Jul 27 2018,positive,it was a great movie if you are between the ages of 12  17 if we have learned anything from the classic movies and shows it is that death brings out the raw emotion that makes a great movie a classic movie this is a prime example of that for christ sake can someone die instead of being saved at every last second movies and series have shelf lives there should be three remaining movies in the saga movie 1  a new villain is introduced and kills his wife movie  2 the villain kills his team movie 3  ethan sacrifices his life to save the world and seek vengeance if they do this it will be remembered for all of time
Jul 27 2018,positive,its got some good stunts and a fun and surprisingly fallible villain but like all mission impossible films it lacks any particular emotional engagement
Jul 27 2018,positive,a fine example as one of the best if not the best modern action movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,believe the hype this movie was everything i wanted it to be its actually jaw dropping its the perfect action movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,not a huge fan of tom cruise i think the cast makes the movie having said that after a slow start the movie finds its groves and knocks it out of the park  action packed edge of your seat drama definitely would see it again
Jul 27 2018,positive,ethan hunt is number 1  mi fallout has great filming locations awesome actionjust an all around terrific movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,i wasnt sure how they could top mi ghost protocol or rogue nation but fallout does while taking elements from each of its predecessors it crafts a new tensionfueled action movie that rightfully is talked about as being the best of the franchise  oh and tom cruise solidifies his place as the best living movie star with his incredible drive to bring deathdefying stunts to the big screen ps he doesnt have to hes fckin tom cruise
Jul 27 2018,positive,one of the best action movies you will see but see it in 3d if you can  didnt give it five stars because the plot was hard to follow and it was a bit sappy but again the action is so good you have to see itl
Jul 27 2018,positive,this movie is truly incredible if you want to watch a movie that completely makes you forget about what else is going on in the world then i highly recommend this movie  this movie has it all and enough to completely pull at your heartstrings tom cruise poors everything he has on the movie and it shows beautifully  
Jul 27 2018,positive,if you like the series this chapter will not disappoint incredible stunt work and chases balanced with returning characters and new ones was a fun movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,fun what action movies are all about 
Jul 27 2018,positive,same old same old i dont know why this movie was rated so high ghost was better
Jul 27 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is the 6th in the series and doesnt disappoint the movie is full of action some jokes and an enjoyable plot recommended
Jul 27 2018,positive,one of the best tom cruise movies i have seen
Jul 27 2018,negative,the dramatic scenes are undramatic the humorous scenes are unhumorous and the action scenes are twice as long as they should be to top it all off you need a spreadsheet to keep track of all the double triple and quadruplecrosses 
Jul 27 2018,positive,fantastic  loved this film so much   please bring back the red light green light chewing gum
Jul 27 2018,positive,omg the best mission impossible movie ever two and a half hours of amazing nonstop action just suspend belief in reality and enjoy 95 out of 10
Jul 27 2018,positive,amazing highenergy nonstop action flick went into this one thinking it would be good but long left feeling like the 2 12 hrs flew by and the movie was great i think it was the best one in the series yet and i do think sean harris character is such a great villain in this one and the last introducing henry cavill was genius as well go see it ill be going again 
Jul 27 2018,positive,saw an advance screening of mission impossible fallout im a huge mi fan now when it comes to the mission impossible series the odd numbered movies have always been great the even numbered ones not so much still wish i could erase mi2 out of existence im happy to say that fallout has broken the streak of bad even numbered mi movies  now thats not to say its one of the best the movie did not have to be two and a half hours long i really wish they had trimmed it down and made it tighter fallout is basically a follow up to the last mi movie which is by far my favorite sadly even though it had the same director given its heavy run time the movie frequently stalls between action set pieces some action sequences go on to long especially the one at the end which from a story perspective is just damn silly  still its a fun movie worth the 15 not 20 in imax it is not just a mindless popcorn flick what lets me down is that everything was there to make it one of the better mission impossibles its just so bloated that the good stuff gets lost in unnecessary excessiveness they really needed an editor with more of a backbone  my mi movies from best to worst  mi rogue nation  mi3  mission impossible  mi fallout  mi ghost protocol  mi 2 would be at the bottom but i still choose to believe it doesnt exist
Jul 27 2018,positive,all the features you expect from a tom cruise movie  action stunts locations humor and emotions  recommended
Jul 27 2018,positive,tom really sets a high value for this movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,loved it this movie has every thing in it summer blockbuster filled with abundant of entertainment tom cruise and cast shines brighter than ever in this amazing action marvel directed by chris mcq
Jul 27 2018,positive,whether you personally believe in this notion or not the mission impossible franchise has been on an upward trajectory for years with the release of the first film entertaining action fans and tom cruise fans alike it was inevitable that a sequel would be made personally i think the second film easily could have sunk this franchise easily mission impossible 3 revitalized the franchise in terms of character and story and the rest is history in terms of critical reception and fan appeal this franchise is better than it has ever been mission impossible  fallout has just hit the big screen and i would be lying to myself if i didnt give in and say this may be my favourite of the entire franchise i know thats a bold statement due to the fact that the previous two films were fantastic but lets dive in    picking up a couple of years after the events of mission impossible  rogue nation this is the first film in the franchise to directly continue a storyline from movie to movie i was slightly wary of this notion but i believe it worked very well following ethan hunt and his team after a failed mission this team seeks out three orbs of plutonium to prevent further global catastrophe while it seems like these are the macguffins of the story solomon lane the previous villain also becomes a macguffin for the team as he stirs up more trouble for them along the way this is a very complex movie at times which leads me to my only real complaint    although this isnt technically a negative because they pay everything off in a very nice way throughout the third act it does feel like there is a little too much going on at times the reason i dont find any of these movies absolutely perfect is due to the fact that they choose to be overly complex in their execution of certain storylines from worldending possibilities to doublecrosses to bringing back previous storylines from past movies and even to relying on an emotional core to the film that some viewers may not latch onto if they havent seen the other movie it can be quite the task of a movie to sit through that being said im a huge fan of this franchise and i was able to follow everything quite easily so i think the execution of my possible aforementioned complaints are only an issue if you havent seen its predecessors    mission impossible  fallout almost seems like a culmination of everything since the third movie and the action is just the icing on the cake although slightly ridiculous at times which of these films isnt though the action throughout this film is some of the best that this franchise has ever seen in my opinion from the handtohand combat to the aerial chases to the terrifically daring stunts this is a sequel that doesnt pull any punches and satisfies in both storytelling and pure adrenalinefuelled excitement at a pretty lengthy 147 minutes i never once felt bored thats probably due to the fact that i loved a lot more than just what was on its surface    christopher mcquarrie returns from the previous film to direct and although each film has a history of switching directors i believe he did a job worthy of continuing from the previous instalment he along with superb cinematography by rob hardy and a surprisingly fresh sounding score by lorne balfe everything about my experience of this film was nothing short being utterly impressed its not very often that i find myself praising a movie for being near perfect on a technical level as well as story and action but mission impossible  fallout did it for me    in the end mission impossible  fallout at least deserves to be in the discussion for best of the franchise even if you personally dont agree if you can allow yourself to be completely immersed in a movie for nearly two and half hours then i believe this may be one of the better moviegoing experience youll have at the theatre this year aside from feeling a little too complex at times there are many arcs that come full circle and i felt incredibly satisfied mission impossible  fallout may not be an oscarcontender but i had an absolute blast with it and its surely going to be included with some of my favourites of 2018
Jul 27 2018,positive,posssibly the best mission a bit overlong and the bad guy just wasnt interesting but those are minor annoyances great stuntscamerawork and a fantastic score 
Jul 27 2018,positive,marvelous stunt action

Jul 27 2018,positive,tom cruise does it again  another great mi film with amazing action set pieces  almost flawlessly executed as a fast paced and surprisingly funny action movie  highly recommended
Jul 27 2018,positive,this has got to be the best in the mi franchise the chases familiar allies and risk taking all pays off in this christopher mcquarrie 2nd directed movie long but didnt feel long with all the riveted scenes especially the bathroom scene and halo jump best helicopter scene  skydiving scene ever tom cruise defies his age for real his commitment to this movie is worth watching over and over again
Jul 27 2018,positive,best action movie since the dark knight
Jul 27 2018,positive,thats tom cruise whatever she accuse  he wasnt really drunk he just had a frew brews
Jul 27 2018,positive,i have to admit it was beter than i expected not a fan of tom cruise but this was gripping with plenty of plot twists albeit a few that were predicable actions scenes impressive but dialogue not that great worth seeing
Jul 27 2018,positive,my favourite mission impossible romp this is a riveting and highstakes actioner that will leave you breathless with its adrenalinepumping set pieces and numerous plot twists
Jul 27 2018,positive,if you like the other mission impossible movies youll love this one  fantastic addition to the story  insane action scenes
Jul 27 2018,negative,dont understand how people like this
Jul 27 2018,positive,action packed  very entertaining  i am a huge fan of the series so i have realistic expectations and this delivered
Jul 27 2018,positive,damm this movie is is great
Jul 27 2018,positive,action from start to finish
Jul 27 2018,positive,where did two and a half hour go wow that was one exciting action filled movie constantly keeping check at the edge of my seat totally awesome
Jul 27 2018,positive,probably one of the greatest action movies of all time
Jul 27 2018,positive,was it tom cruise or usain bolt man he ran more than all of these previous franchise movies worth it every step   fallout bigger  better than all previous movies i think the best of them all the chasing sequences are just out of the world cinematography is so intense you can feel the adrenaline rush  story was good although grey shades to the characters as we predict the mission was so impossible they made a film on it  really i liked the action sequences very much nothing like any other movie some will say its the best action film of the year  tom cruise movies are always unique as he does all the stunts himself in this movie also some dangerous stunts were there but dont worry tom cruise is there for the rescue so fasten your seat belt  enjoy   tom cruise ethan hunt sixth movie still looks fresh  energetic as of its the first mi salute to the stuntman cruise   henry cavill superman sorry walker so this was the movie he was shooting for with a mustache which had to be cgied in justice league hmmm played well   ving rhames when humanitys existence is in danger who do you call luther d   simon pegg the good ol benji brings humour to the movie mask is getting in his skin ssshhhh no spoiler    rebecca ferguson killer beauty she can kick some a of course we watched her in rogue nation this time was nonetheless    sean harris angela bassett vanessa kirby mitchelle monaghan wes bentley frederick schmidt alec baldwin gave support very well  all in all the best entertaining action flick for the running year so the rating is drum rolls as always dhadhadhedhedhadhadhedhe awesometacular    peace v
Jul 27 2018,positive,probably the best movie i have ever seen truly great work
Jul 27 2018,positive,good but not great mission impossible hard to top previous two installments ghost protocol and rogue nation i thought it was weak and lazy to use the same villain again definitely missed having jeremy renner the action sequences are awesome and amazing but again pale in comparison to previous two films i will however go see this again cant wait for the next sequel i consider this the best franchise going
Jul 27 2018,positive,it was thrilling and so intense you really have to watch this if you like action movies
Jul 27 2018,positive,holy crap was this movie awesome way better than my expectations and some of the best stunt work ive ever seen it all felt so real highly recommend ps if you dont like this i would never listen to any recommendations from you and your opinion is void seriously i say that about very few movies too
Jul 27 2018,positive,not quite up there with rogue nation but still a great ride while its predecessor and ghost nation had a more comic book action vibe fallout has gone down the gritty and emotional route which does tend to bog it down at points  most of the action sequences are very well done but feel a bit generic  fist fight gun fight car chase foot chase etc  with nothing as stylish or inventive as the underwater server hack or opera house scenes from rn and certainly nothing as iconic as the cia infiltration from mi1 that being said the final set up in kashmir is incredibly tense and wellexecuted
Jul 27 2018,positive,it does exactly what its supposed to it thrills it reminds us why tom cruise is a moviestar hes achieved a bondian stature harboring the gravitas of sean connery while delivering gags some groaners without the mugginess of roger moore chris mcquarrie directs the hellfire out of this flick and editor eddie hamilton cuts it like an endlessly faceted exploding diamond rebecca ferguson smolders vanessa kirby fascinates and simon pegg pushes for more than sidekick henry cavill is solid and complicated hot fun
Jul 27 2018,positive,tom cruise knows how to make a great action flick and mi fallout doesnt disappoint ive seen all of the mi movies and fallout may be the best
Jul 27 2018,positive,i saw mission impossible six on the opening night and wow did i enjoy this actionpacked edge of your seat thriller tom c hide and his team did such an amazing job in the sixth instalment this one and i could probably see another six more mission impossible once again this is a must see now there was a bit of fat in the middle but of course the huge stunts came in      bye for now
Jul 27 2018,positive,enjoyed this movie a great deal  definitely a plot we have seen before so to speak  however this was a great ride with superb cinematography and action scenes to keep you on the edge  main fight scene motorcycles and helicopters add to the much great action
Jul 27 2018,positive,the best movie of tom cruise and henry cavil  best of the series  must watch for the intense action and study line and jaw drop
Jul 27 2018,positive,its nothing new but its fun 
Jul 27 2018,positive,this movie was dope definitely better than bond mcquarrie is a beast on the script one of the best writers of our time tom cruise runs with the high knees and high hands i wont give out spoilers but the plot did a good job of making you guess whos who might be the best one
Jul 27 2018,positive,what a fantastic ride
Jul 27 2018,positive,best mi movie series ever gonna watch it again
Jul 27 2018,positive,i just want to put this out there    cruise  mcquarrie  match made in action packed heaven     the mission impossible movie series feels a lot like the fast and furious and i know its a strange connection but with each movie it seems to find its footing and place and when it does it gets better and better and crazier with each movie and with this latest mission impossible fallout this once again solitifies tom cruise as a beast when it comes to stunts and top notch actiondont forget the running cause theres a lot of that too the story provides just enough twist and turns to keep you occupied as well as putting you at the edge of your seatonly two mission impossible movies have done that in years and it wasnt mi 2 that crappy ass movie    the story comes after the events of rouge nation where whats left of the syndicate is trying to find peace though chaos by stealing three nuclear cores and once again ethan hunt tom cruise and the rest of his imf team must go on a globe trotting adventure to stop a newly formed rouge nation from causing devastation on a massive scale the story is something we have heard of before in any other typical spy thriller but without spoiling anything the fun and the twists that come from this feels close and pays some homage to the series as well as the first movie without going overboard in fact it feels like throughout this movie that they take alot of elements from every missionimpossible movie here and there just to add on to the fun and the way the director and writers add these features its a beautiful mix worth watching      i love how each character gets their time to shine more in this movie than any other mi films well 1 3 somewhat 4 and 5 im a big fan for luther vhig rhames and i felt his character is underutilized in at least 2 of these said movies and i was glad that he gets a much bigger role in this movie and in fact he feels moreso like the heart of the group the one that knows ethan more than anyone being that hes been around him for years and both trust each other with their lives and i felt it showed much more in this more than a film like mi 2 the dynamic of the team is every bit as great than in any other film previous and you see how loyal they are to ethan as ethan is every bit as loyal to them and thats the human aspect which works so well in this movie cause at the end of the day its not always about tom cruise its about him and his team that works with him henry cavills character of walker was that hammer the person who would do whatever it takes to stop the weapon and the fight scenes omg the action sequences i saw this in imax so the punches feltsounded brutal and the action sequences like i said before proves that tom is rising up there next to jackie chan in providing the best by doing his own stunt work for a man pushing 50 he got what it takes to get a movie done rightnow i can argue that henry should have kept that beard for justice league but thats neither here nor there     so wheres the flawwell 1 this movie should have been longerlmao i wanted more i wanted more intensity that this movie put out you had moments to take a breath and then the action kicked itgives you a brief moment rest again and then action overdrive and it was so goodit worked for every scene and it puts a sense of humanity ethans character cause you know hes not superhuman but he cares about the lives that hes willing to do what he can to save them 2nd flawthe final climax did feel a bit wash rinse repeat of itselfit felt like something youve already seen before and while this movie did a good job with the climax i couldnt help but to say to myself in the theater you know how this will end and of course it ended that way so that was pretty much it     overall i will go as far and say this is the best in the series hands down   while i do love the first movie and mi 3 was mediocre but fun to say the least and the ghost protocol and rouge nation were the most fun fallout pretty much says hold my beer to its own franchise its fun smart intense and while it falls into predictable territory towards the last act it still kept me wanting more from this movie and with that im going to go see it again cause its damn worth it    55 stars  i will add one more star for tom cruise doing his own damn stunts its amazing   and another star for actually using the footage from that infamous rooftop scene of him limping that was really ballsyi loved it      black guy that reviews movies
Jul 27 2018,positive,best action film of the decade best entry in the franchise and certainly the best summer movie of the year everything in this movie is superbly done respect and salute
Jul 27 2018,positive,best in the franchise
Jul 27 2018,positive,probably the second best in the franchise after the original
Jul 27 2018,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in a very long time it rivals mad max fury road as the best in at least a decade
Jul 27 2018,positive,love it  much better than mi rogue nation  i give 485 go and watch  you will be entertained for that long hours
Jul 27 2018,positive,impossible white man at its best love the movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,tom cruise at it again
Jul 27 2018,negative,like most action movies they are way overthe top this is no exception 
Jul 27 2018,positive,the best action movie of the year between the amazing directing writing and plot fantastic performances and stunts there is nothing this film cant do sit back soak into this world dont think too hard too and enjoy the show
Jul 27 2018,positive,excellent movie easily one of my favorite mi movies instant classic  it delivers the goods round after round  edge of your seat action mixed with just enough laughter
Jul 27 2018,positive,give it all the money all the stars i kept forgetting to breath fallout 
Jul 27 2018,positive,fallout is one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life
Jul 27 2018,positive,its okay but not great the previous one was way more dynamic
Jul 27 2018,positive,90 out of 10 this is the dark knight of the mission impossible franchise not sure they can ever top this one for me incredible jawdropping stunts real sense of danger  consequences all while dramatically putting its characters in morally tough spots see this in imax tom cruise saved this summer
Jul 27 2018,positive,these movies get better and better spectacular
Jul 27 2018,positive,intense and pretty easy to follow 
Jul 27 2018,positive,amazing action sequences pays off most loose ends
Jul 27 2018,positive,oh my god  tom cruise is back
Jul 27 2018,positive,wow what a movie has everything you want on a movie tom is amazing a must see already i want to see it again 
Jul 27 2018,positive,the best mission impossible yet intense filled with action excellent story and pacing stunts are more intense than ever definitely worth seeing
Jul 27 2018,positive,good movie solid not a 98 though 
Jul 27 2018,positive,it was entertaining and fun to watch however some of the typical action movies issues are on display corny one liners unrealistic health after huge crashes and somewhat expected twists its good for someone who has seen the rest of the series
Jul 27 2018,positive,on the edge of my seat from the very beginning 
Jul 27 2018,positive,a little hard to follow but what mi movie isnt amazing stunts loved henry cavzil in it too very action packed spoiler alert would really love if julias husband ends up being lark in the next one 
Jul 27 2018,positive,best movie of summer 
Jul 27 2018,positive,this is one of the best action films ever made its smart challenging the audience to follow every sentence and every move the set pieces are on a whole other level here and i cant wrap my head around how they filmed some sequences each character is used quite well and nobody was wasted tom cruise continues to prove that hes an incredible and versatile actor with his performance and his stunts im so pleased that the 6th film in a franchise could be the best this series just keeps going up and i hope that theres more to come from these characters
Jul 27 2018,positive,lives up to the hype 
Jul 27 2018,positive,pretty good with tons of twists and turns 
Jul 27 2018,positive,this movie sets a new benchmark for action and its possibly the best in the franchise the stunts are unbelievable huge respect to tom cruise for all the risks he took to make this film
Jul 27 2018,positive,your mission should you choose to accept it will involve watching tom cruise live out his fantasy of being a stuntman for a torturous two and a half hours on the big screen yes cruise is back as spymaster ethan hunt in this sixth installment in the mission impossible franchise this time leading his imf team on a joint mission with a cia assassin henry cavill to stop a terrorist group from launching a nuclear attack aimed at destroying a third of the worlds population this sequel has all the clichéd dialogue contrived spy vs spy cloak and dagger melodrama and ridiculously over the top action sequences weve come to expect from the franchise over the years and then there are the car chases and foot chases and helicopter chases and probably other chases that we cant recall due to the pulsepounding mindnumbing sensory overload of action that while entertaining fails to mask a laughably silly convoluted storyline that takes itself way too seriously cavill however is a nice fresh addition to the film as is the super charismatic vanessa kirby princess margaret in netflixs the crown as the sarcastic knifewielding white widow in all a fun albeit mindless film that will likely selfdestruct from your memory five seconds after leaving the theater b  thereelnesscom
Jul 27 2018,positive,nonstop action do not leave to go to the restroom insane twists and unbelievable stunts
Jul 27 2018,positive,as we all know this is the sixth instalment of the franchise supposedly by this time the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about so within so without sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of however mission impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement as the impossible becomes possible as it suggests that statement is merely a myth as the ideas never entirely run out as the stunts are afresh and eyecatching but can this new instalment keep up with the others putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree its the worst or will it have a serious fallout    one thing to talk about is the plot it is superficially heavy this time in fact the heaviest out of all the series plus it is intertwined and ultracomplicated for a summer hollywood movie that you will be exhausted after the 147 mins ride what makes this successful is that it has that oscarworthy vibe and it solves the puzzles very neatly towards the end despite some revelations might come off as predictable and before i forget to mention this movie has a lot of deep connections with rogue nation the 5th instalment watch the previous instalment before stepping into this new mission or you will hardly relate with the characters and if youve had the time revise the 3rd one too    now you must promptly be wondering how about the stunts let me get to this part the stunts are real every time you go in watching this best ongoing franchise in the world you should bear in mind that cgi is a nonexistent element and the stunts are performed by tom cruise himself the daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this years other action blockbuster movies to shame the bathroom scene will leave you in total shock the paris scene will make you gasp due to many unexpected moments the rooftop scene will make you wonder which one that got tom cruise injured the kashmir scene will make your heart jitters and probably pees in your pants because the stunts are all real    acting is well done of course henry cavill savors his swashbuckler swagness simon pegg brings less comedy to the table but executes a more matured lad rebecca ferguson has improved a lot since her debut in rogue nation and she has lost a lot of weight that perfectly suits her role michelle monaghan makes us miss her character so much and eventually fall in love with her and tom cruise is anything good you can possible talk about he is a legend    what i like is it plays a bit different this time in which there is less overthetop artificial techs and more to realistic stunts that put the gadgets to rest this time this is a classified mission where nothing is impossible in reality but it is impossible to commit because of how dangerous and menacing there are     they opt on breathtaking locations as they fill with richness and intensity making the movie charges with a load of energy that transmits to the audience who becomes alive and fully realizes that this is the exact location without any usage of cgi    when the action scenes come in especially the paris scene the sound effect is topnotch you can hear those tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall sucking the audience as if we are in the action movie ourselves    what i dislike is the repetitive dialogues by tom cruise it is semicool and semiirritating because he keeps saying the same phrases at every different location it comes off as irritating but why is it cool is because sometimes it uses the thirdact solution technique in creating a storyline and humor apparently    another thing i dislike is the scene when the theme song emerges on the big screen dont get me wrong i love and salute the theme song however i hate it when it shows glimpses of scenes and stunts that about to happen afterwards followed by its chronological order in my opinion that is a big spoiler    and i dislike that they fail to tell jeremy renners character whereabouts after rogue nation as far as i can remember    truth to be told i wasnt a huge fan of the mission impossible series until three months before this movie came out i felt a whole energy down my spine and knew this is going to be a good one bloody hell how wrong was i it isnt just good it is stateoftheart masterpiece action blockbuster film    so if im going to rank all the six impossiblemade films it would be from best to worst    6 4 3 5 1 and 2    is there any hope for this franchise to survive in hollywood very possible is there any story left that this franchise can get hold onto for the next instalment possible is there any chance you might doze off during the movie at any condition impossible is there any chance left that the stunts can get any better than fallout very impossible    your mission should you choose to accept it is to see mission impossible fallout in theaters    overall 90100    this message will selfdestruct in 5 seconds
Jul 27 2018,positive,omg tom is crazy stop doing your own stunts your going to kill yourselves but dam does it make a fantastic movie edge of your seat excitement seeing it again
Jul 27 2018,positive,the action and fight choreography are wonderful just dont expect to be surprised by anything the twists are telegraphed a mile off and are virtually impossible not to see coming
Jul 27 2018,positive,hands down best movie of the year
Jul 27 2018,negative,this is actually the first time ive ever walked out on a movie great actors not acting but robotic and obvious incredibly boring 
Jul 27 2018,positive,a bit too much predictable action even for a mission impossible film but i thought it was exciting through out with brilliantly directed action scenes with a storyline that had the viewer guessing at what was to follow again it was predictable but for what it is a really fun and enjoyable action movie which is the brands intention right
Jul 27 2018,positive,saw on wednesday night in abu dubai awesome 
Jul 27 2018,positive,another great mission impossible tom cruise and company never fail
Jul 27 2018,positive,a well done example of modern film making
Jul 27 2018,positive,the best mission impossible film since the original and easily the best action movie of the year thus far i seriously doubt there will be another major release in the next 5 months that will keep me on the edge of my seat the way this one did everything i wanted and more
Jul 27 2018,positive,its face paced and actually requires you to watch closely at the details of certain scenes overall one of the greatest  greatest action movies ive ever seen looking for more cruise action
Jul 27 2018,positive,this is what action cinema should be amazing practical stuntwork that must be witnessed and experienced on the biggest screen you can find
Jul 27 2018,positive,best mission impossible film ever
Jul 27 2018,positive,awesome  action packed
Jul 27 2018,positive,i cant stop looking at her scene good job tom 
Jul 27 2018,positive,100 the best entry of the mission impossible franchisethe most hardcore tom cruise fast paced with pure adrenaline you will want to jump run and drive like a crazy after the credits roll and action level just as mad max did in 2015
Jul 27 2018,positive,my husband and i saw the movie tonight and we just got back can i just say omg that movie was a total rush and the minute it was over i said to my husband we have come back tomorrow night to see it again  i think it is the best one and i have seen them all  and tom cruise is ageless wowowowowowow
Jul 27 2018,positive,the setting is so gorgeous it almost makes your eyes bleed all of the acting is stellar monaghan and cruise are able to portray a sensitive relationship paradox with clarity and sweetness and fallout succeeds in making hunt human while also firmly reaffirming his demigod status though the film deserves four and a half stars my love for the franchise could not make this any less than a five
Jul 26 2018,positive,spoiler alert tom cruise does run a lot in the latest impossible mission not only is this mission possible it is downright probable despite what any sort of contrived plot parameter demands it not be like any of the previous installments in this beloved action espionage franchise offer we are treated to two and a half hours of nonstop setup and payoff double agents defy orders single agents defy borders hot triple agent action occurs in a bathroom stall for the frenchmen to earnestly catcall and the badman tries to nuke civilization for the nth time despite how silly all of the dialogue is and despite how undercut the spy film tropes are for the sake of staying fresh this is an awesome return to form for modern american action cinema    you could sit there in your big boy chair tearing apart the screenplay like you rend your fried chicken tender flesh from its amalgamate finger form but you would be doing yourself a disservice henry cavill sacrificed his mustache credibility for this role and damn you if you cant appreciate what he did it for from the cold and deceptively prolonged opening sequence to the first plot point where ethan hunt has to decide if he will defy utilitarianism to the second plot point where ethan hunt has to decide that he will defy utilitarianism we are ensured all sorts of daunting nuclear moral conundrums but dont worry hes such a stand up guy that not only will he choose his friends over his accepted mission or responsibility to ensuring the safety of millions but hell sacrifice a crap ton of efficient use of screen time for a really awesome extended set piece and lets face it thats what we came here for    anything you have heard about the action in this film is not overstated ill admit theres a bit too much tealamber for my taste in the cinematography but the movie is damned beautiful bar the editing of the scene in the club with white widow  that kind of cut contrast is just gross looking the action sequences are what justify this mainstream approach after all how else could you unify sky jumping through a thunderstorm traffic chases through paris fist fights in a rave bathroom and helicopteraphying the peaks of kashmir doesnt matter action man punched and shot his way out of authoritarian disillusionment and saved all of the plebs to spite them thank xenu for sweet baby action christ tom cruise
Jul 26 2018,positive,absolutely outstanding film  i wasnt sure how this franchise could outdo itself but with each and every installment i am blown away  fun movie that leaves nothing to be desired except maybe a longer duration  go out and see this film  the most thrilling film out there
Jul 26 2018,positive,best mission  impossible so far possibly true what a ride this movie is
Jul 26 2018,positive,does tom cruise ever make a disappointing movie i cant think of one and this one would be one of the better ones
Jul 26 2018,positive,i never know what to say about the big budget cgi fests  its two and a half hour run time feels like half that thanks to the fun set pieces and the ageless charisma of tom cruise      in the end will we remember these in a few months if we dont see it again no  but who cares  final score 7510
Jul 26 2018,positive,a stellar action movie the action and direction are stunning
Jul 26 2018,positive,the acting is amazing as always in these series quality is excellent however storyline of events is not surprising we are getting bored of infiltration story and countdown sequence 10981 solved
Jul 26 2018,positive,incredible action and effects best mi yet
Jul 26 2018,positive,if plot is your thing then this movie comes with a lot of twists and turns  there is significant pleasure in watching cruise pull off his super human feats  and while the the story is beautifully designed something in the fun and heart of the series has been lost since ghost protocol  brad birds presence injected the franchise with a much needed dose of imaginationwe saw cool gadgets great gags and very imaginative set pieces that raised the bar for cruise and company  but since christopher mcquarrie has taken the helm we have been treated to beautiful imagery and stunts that dont fully cohere  there are pacing issues in both rogue nation and fallout action sequences that seem to end on a flat note and yet want you to interpret flatness as nothing less than cleverness  there are moments where the sequences in fallout seem to reach a state of transcendence for action cinema until you realize that the scenes are not in fact transcending anything you havent seen before instead they are allowing those moments to play longer than normal   for me the central flaw of this fiilm was returning to a villain we have seen beforein that fallout plays like the typical sequel that would have played in the 80s same characters same general moments slightly different plot  in fact one can almost replace rogue nation with fallout and the franchise would be much better off for it   as an ardent fan of the mission impossible film and television series i always look forward to another movie installment  there is so much satisfaction in character of ethan hunt to keep me coming back for more even when the emotional engagement is contrived and artificial  i hope the series returns to the type of balance of plot  gadgetry and imagination that we saw in ghost protocol   otherwise im not interested in seeing another mission crafted by mcquarrie
Jul 26 2018,positive,omgits so good tom cruise is pretty much the best movie star in the history of cinema  its just a wow
Jul 26 2018,positive,just watched this latest mi and two big thumbs up great plot with funny dialogues and surprises beautifully filmed and choreographied highly recommended
Jul 26 2018,positive,one of the best action movies of all timed period you may think im just saying that because its new and fresh but this film has some of the most jawdropping scenes ive ever seen all in one movie the story is very emotionally charged this time which is a step in a different direction for the franchise i think for the better the stunts are flawless the action is endless and the mission is impossible go see this movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,spoilers ahead      best mission impossible movie   best summer movie  best movie of 2018    this is hollywood at its finest a tier 1 film with tier 1 sets tier 1 actionstunts tier 1 actors and tier 1 camera work this is the extraordinary story telling i love fast paced smart treats the audience like adults and enthralling the entire 150 minutes    best score in the franchise  solomon lane redeemed himself to be up there with owen davian psh as villian    best emotional stakes since mi3    every character gets their moment even alec baldwin    best opening in the franchise i  mean my god how good was that reveal    ving rhames emotional speech about ethan to ilsa    and the cops massacre in ethan head before actually capturing lane gave me dark knight vibes especially with the scoring    showing the stakes and the affect on the world for ethans and imf actions felt real serious heavy and deep making this film stakes exciting serious and important that id say 95 of action films cant capture    i cant explain the importance and spectacularity of the real stunts real effects and camera work you know if you saw it    this film is miles ahead of assembly line action crap we get in abundance every year this set the bar high and the more i reflect on this i do believe this is one of the best action films of all time    this film could never be nominated for best picture but it should it does everything right such a shame    1010    all my opinion though
Jul 26 2018,positive,an action movie master piece great pacing perfectly timed humor and overall fluid and some of the best action scenes ever to be shot

Jul 26 2018,positive,loved it    action  story drama
Jul 26 2018,positive,best action pack movie in a long time
Jul 26 2018,positive,great film and the last 3035 minutes is jaw droppingly amazing absolutely at the fury roadindiana jones level which i consider to be the current pinnacle of real life action in hollywood even little scenes were directed and crafted with great care    having watched all five prior films over the past week i am stunned that they took the time to really match up events and answer unanswered questions from prior films weve been waiting for three films for a full explanation of what happened with julia by the way  ethan has a type    cavill was fantastic the resolution of the lane storyline was great i cant believe they fucking got me again with that doublefake in the middle    can i say again how jaw droppingly amazing those final sequences were    i feel like it was with this movie shockingly the sixth in the series that we finally get a full picture of ethan hunt our protagonist hes been a cypher for so long with only a few layers peeled off in each film it almost feels weird to actually have him snap into place as a fully fleshed out character roughly 23rds of the way through this film    i love scifi and comic book action gimme big cgi space portals on a regular basis but you know what it was so goddamned refreshing to feel like real people were doing real stunts and it added an absolute ton to the immersion and seat of your pants feeling maybe a little too much in imax  i felt like i was being put through the wringer and cruise my god if he really did everything that it clearly looks like he actually did he should get a ton more credit for putting himself through this the leaping and motorcycle scenes  ye gods
Jul 26 2018,positive,jeez this movie is intense the beautifully choreographed fight scenes and the crazy stunts make this movie awesome to watch visually and then the twists and turn make it awesome mentally every single character is great and the final act is maddingly intense if there is one flaw at all it would be the difficulty to follow is quite high but other than that mission impossible fallout is a must see with might i add greatly placed humor in the mind melding fury of an action crazy tom cruise
Jul 26 2018,positive,awesome and action packed
Jul 26 2018,positive,it was much better than cats im going to see it again and again
Jul 26 2018,positive,incredible up there with mad max as the best action films of the last decade somehow this franchise keeps getting better its out lasted bourne and is more consistent then bond other filmmakers should learn how to craft action sequences from this movie cant believe how good this is
Jul 26 2018,positive,one the best mission  impossible movies one of my favs  tom and superman all the way
Jul 26 2018,positive,great action thriller with well choreographed fight scenes overall a 10 out of 10 slam dunk of an action film
Jul 26 2018,positive,my family loves this franchise and this was the best one yet will go back to see it in 3d just for the helicopter scene alone a bit of a predictable start that then blasted off into a movie that felt much shorter than than it was my 8 year old and i were thrilled with it ps the last 30 minutes or so was such a nail biter that people were hiding behind their hands  shirts in the theater 
Jul 26 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout 2018   1010  crizzyview  27 july 2018  this movie is a blast its nonstop action and well written it represents tom cruise at his all time best he far exceeds expectations the trailers are only a small fraction of the magnificent action scenes in this movie the sound is top notch especially the gun shots the visuals are stunning well done tom great job i give mission impossible  fallout 2018 ten fingers
Jul 26 2018,positive,stop whatever youre doing phone a friend and go see this damn materpiece of a movie imo one of the best action movies ever made and certainly the best action movie since the dark knight
Jul 26 2018,positive,awesome movie best action
Jul 26 2018,positive,one of the most exciting seriously entertaining and outrageous action events of the summer with amazing stunts and fight scenes and edge of your seat thrills
Jul 26 2018,positive,holy cow   i read reviews and thought ok its probably a good movie but it cant be that great  i was so impressed i will see this again within the week a truly must see movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,when taking predictable baddies constant twists and frustrating escalation of the climax into account this movie is still unreasonably more fun than it has any right to be as the sixth installment of any franchise i had a blast
Jul 26 2018,positive,good movie entertaining but too long  the could of made it a normal two hour movie and probably been better   the ending for me was too much enough is enough just move on   tom is getting too old to play the action hero and needs to start being more the  guy who fight more with his wits than his fists
Jul 26 2018,negative,if you enjoy movies with zero plot superherolike fiction tied to action sequences and car chases galore then this is your film it has no where to go and gets more intolerable as the movie progresses for the few moments it has they arent enough to make this a good movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,the electrifying duo that is christopher mcquarrie and tom cruise have yet again produced a spy thrilling masterpiece as if they were in their prime      it seems that each mission impossible is better than the last  of course if you remove the second instalmentdisaster from the list however the recent joining of director and screenwriter christopher mcquarrie to the mission impossible production has sent this franchise through the roof with each action sequence you believe cruise more and more it is safe to say now that tom cruise has truly become ethan hunt the film is sensory euphoria with a core rooted in what we all want realism to be mcquarries screenplay is filled with plot twists and deception to the viewer that could be perceived as cheesy but it is hard not to get caught up in this film you will want it to take you for a ride to what every spythriller movie strives to be
Jul 26 2018,positive,amazing tom cruise can do no wrong
Jul 26 2018,positive,very good movie this is the longest and the best mi yet theyve really upped the ante on the locations and camerawork this time especially on the last location showcasing the mountains and the snowy terrains while the action is still present
Jul 26 2018,positive,its got every element of a great action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat a few nods to previous mission impossible films and has loads of action humour stunts and great storylines probably my newfavourite mission film up there with james bond
Jul 26 2018,positive,awesome movie the action is incredible and the plot is on point with stakes worthy of an impossible mission i already want to see it a second time great acting superman is amazing in this film and tom cruise never disappoints but the rest of the cast was phenomenal loved it
Jul 26 2018,positive,many people will be wondering why the 6th installment of this franchise is getting critical acclaim and being praised by most people if you are one of those people please go see this film for yourself if youre a fan of action practical stunts adrenaline infused tension great characters great humor and surprising drama then this film will likely be the pinnacle of satisfaction
Jul 26 2018,positive,best mission yet by far probably one of the best action movies ive ever seen in my life the action was so onpoint furious and intense ive only seen was mission impossible rogue nation and thats it along with this one so its my second movie for me i need to see all of them in order to know whats really going on with the other plots to them rogue nation is what got me interested in these series and i absolutely love them tom cruise is a beast and he is such a great stuntman i love the fact how the action sequences looked so practical and there was hardly any use of cgi most of the time like maybe 8590 was real while 1015 was very little cgi even though they used a little bit of cgi it wasnt that noticeable in any way since it already looked realistic i enjoyed the heck out of this awesome movie tom cruise still has it and wow its a miracle that he didnt fail the stunts except with the one part on the rooftop where he was running and jumped off the edge of the ledge on a platform and bruised his ankle that was insane how they kept that shot in the movie thats why it does makes this movie look better and realistic because he actually did hurt himself while he was filming and it proves that hes the man to do it and doesnt hesitate to do so he doesnt mind taking any risks in his life a very brave man im telling you this was so amazing and thrilling and maybe is a better improvement from the others it will have you off the edge of your seat and hell that was an awesome experience especially seeing it in 3d everything about it was great loved it
Jul 26 2018,positive,this is hands down the single best mission impossible film to date best writing best plot best acting best action best comical moments best score  i loved the soundtrack because they had more classic cues from the original series    everyone in the film was just terrific but henry cavill is the single best part of this film he owned this character
Jul 26 2018,positive,cinematography acting writing pacing sound    total score 1220  10 score 9510    camerawork lighting fight choreography it was all done exceptionally well with many memorable shots the acting was great with a few powerful moments but nothing that raises it to a  on its own the innovation in tom cruises stunt work is why the acting rating is rightfully brought up the writing wasnt perfect but had good dialogue with an easy to follow story and minimal plot holes there were some issues with pacing toward the beginning and maybe a few missteps in the middle but in the end managed to flow very well which definitely serves its purpose in maintaining its suspense sound design and soundtrack are as great as ever except for some music being a little too noticeable at times making parts seem cheesy when theyre taking the serious route  all in all mission impossible  fallout is beautiful well acted and an intense and immensely enjoyable ride this is a mustsee    wanna see where it landed on my 2018 top movies list go here 
Jul 26 2018,positive,omg   best one yet  one of the best movie experiences ever  on the edge of my seat the entire movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout combines the mindblowing stakes and beautifully directed set pieces of the more recent films with the twisting storytelling of the original film to create a product significantly better than the sum of its parts incorporating great performances from an even more allstar cast than before to truly sell the drama and the jokes thank you simon pegg in spite of a curiously absent jeremy renner
Jul 26 2018,positive,hard to believe it but this movie series keeps on getting better with each new addition talk about an adrenalin rush of a movie the cast is solid and you will be floored by the stunts that tom cruise does wow easily the best movie of the series and definitely one of the best movies to see in 2018
Jul 26 2018,positive,great the critics like it that means i will not
Jul 26 2018,positive,the best james bond movie in the franchise by far
Jul 26 2018,positive,really starts out cheesy with cheesy lines but then the action picks up and boy does it pick up def worth seeing in the theaters
Jul 26 2018,positive,5 up excellent action movie excellent plot  simply excellent   highly recommend it   
Jul 26 2018,neutral,if you only care about jawdropping action sequences you might enjoy this movie plot is weak and predictable and nothing is particularly realistic  characters or action 
Jul 26 2018,positive,this is truly acting
Jul 26 2018,positive,an exuberant extravaganza that plays with its audience like a mere 4 year old kid    mission impossible  fallout    4 out of 5    mission impossible  fallout is a plot driven thriller feature that may not be the game changer in the franchise but is deliberately a palindrome to its predecessor in its own edgy and shady way     ticking for almost 150 minutes it neatly edits out all its commercial aspects leaving the audience with all the husky bit which is utterly complicated to its core if lost any focus the rest of the material may come out as mumbojumbo demanding the attention through it and allowing the audience not a split second to breathe     having said that it doesnt suggest in any way that the writing is smart it basically is all cheat and all tricks to a point where the audience start questioning everything the pace too is uneven at some points which is frankly inedible but this is where mcquarrie the writerdirector comes in and smartly makes it all glorifying for the audience to chew in the characters perspective easily     it is rich on technical aspects like breathtaking camera work stunning production design and alluring visuals addition to that the choreography of all the chase or action sequences is so finely detailed and lethally performed that leaves the audience in an awe of it     with all the buzz of the cast performing their own stunts especially by cruise after a certain point seems essential to get the audience enchanted into it and calculate the magnitude of the stakes projected in here and connect instantly     the only two reason why the feature fails to enter the major league would be its lack of creativity on the concept and the poetic theme that seems to be the missing puzzle in here cruise is confident mature and has evolved a lot on portraying the character where he may be vulnerable but not weak     pegg cavill ferguson and rhames gets their own stand out moments which they hold on to it decently live locations exhilarating stunts throatslicing politics and cruise at the heart of it are the high points of this feature that unflinchingly delivers     mission impossible  fallout is an exuberant extravaganza that plays with its audience like a mere 4 year old kid and the wise thing would be to nod along
Jul 26 2018,positive,i saw the mission impossible movie on july 25 its already released in asia and it was great very entertaining and great action scenes the whole way through the movie the same excellent quality as of the other mission impossible movies definitely a must see
Jul 26 2018,positive,spectaculartom cruise never ceases to amaze he is a perfectionisttop notch performance in an action packed  thriller as good as it gets
Jul 26 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyable spy action
Jul 26 2018,positive,this was the best mission impossible so far reminded us a lot of the very first one kept us on the edge our seats the whole time great movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,the stunts were awesome and a great movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,meh only great thing about this mi movie alec baldwin died the movie was waaaaay too long 
Jul 26 2018,positive,without going into too much detail i liked the movie the storyline plateaued for a bit in the middle prior to the climax but all in all another great entry into the franchise 
Jul 26 2018,positive,yes i did shout out oh shit when  hunt tom cruise sails over the bonnet of a car during a fantastic car and motorbike chase around paris  particularly exciting is the contraflow part around the  arc de triomphe  and yes blessedly benji simon pegg is toned done from being a complete slapstick guffoon  the edge of the seat action makes for more entertainment than you can shake a stick at  this has to be the finest movie of the all mission impossibles so far  and i am really hoping theres going to be more of this calibre
Jul 26 2018,positive,superb action movie does not disappoint  must watch on big screen
Jul 26 2018,positive,best missions impersonation 
Jul 26 2018,positive,what the movie does well it does extremely well firstrate action setpieces and even though you know twists are coming it still pulls some amusing and clever plot sleightsofhand movie is weighed down by more or less being a tom cruise show good in some ways but grating when the script goes into fullblown ethan hunt hagiography as it feels unnecessary schmaltzy and extremely superficial and i couldnt help seeing it as tom cruises thinlyveiled love letter to himself ving rhamess talent and screen magnetism is especially wasted in service to this alec baldwin isnt given anything special to do here also wasted potential but boy the skydive into paris the action scene in the bathroom the rooftop chase scene the scene where ethan hunt is posing as a terrorist and has to pretend to lead an organized and weaponized extraction of the worlds topfugitive from lawenforcement hands while simultaneously thwarting said extraction without blowing his cover thrilling sequence simon pegg is an excellent sidekick and angela basset and henry cavill turn in fine enjoyable performances
Jul 26 2018,positive,entertaining and not a dull moment  mi is up to its usual antics but you will still love every turn and twist
Jul 26 2018,positive,really really good great action movie does what it says on the tin
Jul 26 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is a a major return for the franchise after the disappointing rogue nation it has a more serious tone which i noticed straight away the action sequences are breathtaking and the cinematography is superb however the storyline and last 15 minutes let it down for me up until that point i was enjoying it immensely but thinking about it i would probably consider it to be the best in the franchise cruise performs some of the most dangerous stunts ever put to screen and for the most part they are pretty much grounded and thrilling it was sad to see a fast and the furious style ending which let it down it didnt need it the film pretty much collectively sums up all of ethans previous exploits and again puts the people he cares about in jeopardy its not very original but its is slickly made and reminded me more of a bond film the chase sequences on motorbikes and on foot are nothing short of spectacular and cruises very publicized broken ankle sequence is still as shocking when you see it again on screen henry cavill and his mustache put in fine performances as menacing cia agents tasked with keeping an eye on ethan the action sequences on display here are sublime its just a shame that theres not a better plot to back them up 
Jul 26 2018,positive,not the most realistic but a clever well written movie
Jul 26 2018,positive,wickedly good action movie  best ive seen since mad max fury road
Jul 26 2018,positive,good flick action packed and entertaining
Jul 26 2018,positive,thank you very much christopher mcquarrie
Jul 26 2018,positive,now this unlike sicario 2 was entertaining wow action packed riveting smart humorous i think this is a top 3r for tom 
Jul 26 2018,positive,first three quarters is great goes overboard in final act and is drawn out 
Jul 26 2018,positive,fortunate to have seen an early screening and it really does rock beautifully crafted and shot with some of the most tense stunts and chases of recent years let alone the  series  and a reminded that not all  magic is created by cgi the characters have really found their feet hats off to pegg and rhames for their warmth the story is complex enough without becoming alienating and theres just enough twists without it becoming annoying as in some mis of the past great fun and at times jawdropping
Jul 26 2018,positive,actionpacked for your eyeballs with a ton of twists and turns to keep you engaged mentally this is an excellent modern spy flick 
Jul 26 2018,positive,awesome  a lot action wonderful story and comedy great job  
Jul 26 2018,positive,each time a mission inpossible film comes out they always find a way to improve upon there last outing and fallout is no exception fallout offers the best action scenes in the franchise and the best character moments aswell this is the best finale in the franchise and the best performance out of tom cruise in the franchise henry cavil is a good newcomer hes nothing special but he adds some fun back and forth the way the plot unfolds in this movie is much more similar to the first mi film than any of the others the best action scene in this film however is definitely the bathroom scene its a great scene with incredible choreography if you havent watched any of the mission impossible movies you probably shouldnt start with this one because this is really the first time an mi movie has connected back to its previous films but you should definitely watch this film
Jul 25 2018,positive,actions pack i loved this movie  
Jul 25 2018,negative,just more tom cruise garbage henry cavill was the best part of the movie
Jul 25 2018,positive,could not have been done better 
Jul 25 2018,positive,enjoyable from start to finish henry cavill was a great addition to this movie i would say it is the best of the series and i would love to see more
Jul 25 2018,positive,the best of the series it is superb action cinema
Jul 25 2018,positive,if i can see it coming its not much of a surprise but ill still avoid the big reveal of who the secret villain is lets just say that the actor plays a villain far more effectively than he does a superhero  whoops  spoiler  i know that countdowns in movies dont reflect real time but i felt like the final sequence in mi fallout was way longer than the mi crew actually was supposed to have that said it was a phenomenal ride of a film and i loved a good paris chase scene any time
Jul 25 2018,positive,this film succeeds at everything it needs to go see it
Jul 25 2018,positive,tom cruise takes on a villianous man of steel henry cavill in the most suspenseful and game changing mission impossible movie yet mr cruise once again kills it with his stunts such as real life skydiving and real life hellicopter flying the story was also great this is indeed a perfect movie and the best mi movie so far paramount and cruise made a wise choice to bring back christopher mcquarrie to direct after he did a superb job with mi rouge nation
Jul 25 2018,positive,best mission impossible movie hands down every minute of it is entertaining and the movie throws ton of unexpected twists at you
Jul 25 2018,positive,fantastic movie very action packed from start to finish was amazing in imax i felt like i was in the movie
Jul 25 2018,positive,so good i cant even deal this and ghost protocol is my ultimate fave i cant wait to watch it again the bathroom scene made my day and apparently took 4 weeks to complete i can see why because i could watch it for 4 weeks straight 
Jul 25 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout was goodreally good tom cruise makes the big bucks for a reason theres no slowing this man down both figuratively and physically for a man in his mid50s to do stunts that most 2030 year old actors wouldnt do themselves speaks volumes to his dedication as an actor henry cavill killed his role as august wilson rebecca ferguson and simon pegg were great supporting cast members but the most shocking to me was ving rhames he had somewhat of an emotional arc that i wouldnt have seen coming from a mile away but i was pleasantly surprised my biggest take away from this film is that chris mcquarrie the oscar winning writer who wrote one of my favorite movies the usual suspects now has the potential to become one of the biggest action directors in hollywood im excited to see what his next project is this film gets 455 for me
Jul 25 2018,positive,the best action movie this year
Jul 25 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout helps keep the action movie genre alive if not breathing life back into it and reinvigorates the impossible in mission impossible with new fast fun action and clever creative ways of evading the police commandeering a manned helicopter and fighting on a mountain cliff
Jul 25 2018,positive,saw it twice great action flick one of the best in the mi series 
Jul 25 2018,positive,i love this movie the storyline and action scenes are amazing tom acted so good and the characters of august walker and white widow are impressive
Jul 25 2018,positive,was able to see an early screening and i loved every minute of this movie the action scenes were amazing and the acting was great it had just the right mix of humor and drama as well the plot was just a bit weak thats not a bad thing its just that it felt like i had seen the story before despite that the movie was awesome and i was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next go see this movie 
Jul 25 2018,positive,i think this is the best one of the entire franchise not only great action that seems nonstop but without getting redundant or overwhelming but a really good script by director christopher mcquarrie as well tom cruise is awesome as ever as is the rest of the ensemble 
Jul 24 2018,positive,when it comes to live action movies i think this movie has everything to offer when tom cruise starts doing what he does best
Jul 24 2018,positive,one of the best actionspy movies of all time tom cruise is a maniac for doing his own stunts and the stunts in this movie are insane

Jul 24 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is exactly what a summer blockbuster should be its smart and layered while still easily followable all while being exciting and fun with great action strong performances and amazing stunts supported by practical effects and brave stuntmen and tom cruz culminate in one of the best action movies ever made one of the best spy thrillers ever made one of the best summer blockbusters ever made and easily one of the best films of 2018 bravo tom cruz and the rest of the cast and crew for continuing a franchise for over two decades that seems to just be getting better
Jul 24 2018,positive,fallout is the darkest one yet but is that a bad thing no it thrills with the greatest set pieces in the mission impossible franchise as well as a plot that is basically its two predecessors which in this case used expertly well fallout also proves that tom cruise may have no equal in the action world  910
Jul 24 2018,positive,the action and stunts are unbelievable  most movies after the 2nd get boring but these mission impossibles get better and better as they the saga continues cant wait to see the next one 
Jul 24 2018,positive,fun to watchunprotected ending i enjoyed paying and going to see it at a movie
Jul 24 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is exactly as thrilling as you hope it will be amazing action but it never overshadows the high stakes the plot is complex but never convoluted plenty of twists and turns some genuinely surprising the characters are so strong henry cavill is a great addition all the stunts big and small are amazing including the best fistfight of the series we dont see stuntwork like this much anymore a breath of fresh air amidst the cgifueled summer mission impossible is as strong as ever some might argue that this is just more of the same theyre right but its more of something excellent i cant wait for more mission impossible
Jul 24 2018,positive,45 stars   very enjoyable movie with loads of awesome action and this time the action sequences are even more dangerous a much more captivating story then most mission impossible movies from before only issue being that the movie took a tad long and overdid a certain theme in the movie
Jul 24 2018,positive,not only the best mission impossible film but the best film of the year so far in my opinion already saw it twice

Jul 17 2018,positive,this movie eclipsed mad max fury road as the best action film of the decade for me tom cruise and chris mcq really raise the bar on this one and some the action set pieces left me with my jaw open and my palms clammy from the excitement and obvious real stunt work going on just amazing edit i just got back from my second viewing of the opening weekend i can officially say that this is the best action movie i have ever seen hats off to everyone involved for making this action masterpiece
Jul 17 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is the first mission impossible movie that ive seen making it my favorite despite that it has flaws and i feel like i can be sure that it isnt the best film i have ever seen i still loved this movie this review is spoiler free     1115 points go to the story category this film has a good story where a load of confusion can be stirred up at any moment there are loads of plot twists that arent shocking due to a terrible marketing campaign there are also unclear plans made at certain moments the basic premise is nothing like ive ever seen though     1010 points go to the acting category tom cruise who learned how to fly a helicopter for this movie is stellar he is a great actor who definitely does very well in this movie henry cavill alec baldwin simon pegg ect also give amazing performances they all seem very into character     1010 points go to the visual effects category the film is visually stunning i enjoy watching the visuals throughout and my eyes werent hurt     1010 points go to the characters category the characters are great they have their purpose and they serve their purpose if they need it they get development if they dont they dont get it its simple as that i think that the character who shines out most is luther luther has an emotional moment and it really makes us see the character as more than a sidekick    4 5 points go to the development category the film sees a problem some twists some mishaps and a solution there is one problem though there are many characters who dont grow at all and dont get the ability to be seen in a whole new light the characters do get into a different place than we saw them at first though    3 5 points go to the original score category the music is really good mission impossible has some of the best music from what ive heard the problem with this score is that there are parts that go with the movie only you cant listen to them without the visuals of the film this is a bit disappointing     55 points go to the design category the film has a great costume design which makes the characters come to life there is also good makeup the design has nothing super special but what it has is amazing i especially love the technology designs    1010 points go to the direction category the film is directed well by whoever directed it the fight scenes are well choreographed and everyone is well directed throughout i think the direction in this movie is probably the most well directed of the year for liveaction films    810 points go to the audio and visual quality category the film sounds pretty good there are many points where the movie sounds like just explosions and gunshots the 3d effects are pretty meh though what is decent is the fact that it doesnt look too dark in 3d id recommend that you see this film in imax where there are scenes where there is extra image the music is also well done and plays at the right moments    1720 points go to the overall consensus category i thought this film was pretty good it is at times slow and the story is at times pretty horribly written i think that the movie is pretty well made choreographed and directed the thing about this film that stands out is the cinematography and fight scenes    score 88  grade b
Jul 17 2018,positive,pretty standard mission impossible movie

Jul 17 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout was a good movie henry cavill was fantastic  my only problem was that the trailer seems to give a lot away and it would have been nice to have a few more surprises  other than that this may be the best mi film i have seen

Jul 13 2018,positive,dbox plenty of people have said this was one of the best action movies to come out since mad max fury road they were right from start to finish mission impossible  fallout was action packed and had me on the edge of my seat the cinematography was downright stunning the skydiving scene bathroom fight car chase scene etc are all amazing in fact everything about this film is amazing there are dozens of moments that i was wrestling with myself over whether some shots were special effects or practical effects the sound design is the best ive heard since blade runner 2049 every punch gunshot breaking of wallshelvestableschairs they all sounded so real it helped emerse me into the movie even more i only have one problem i never really understood the motives of the villains some people just wanted anarchy but others just did it for an unexplained reason i would have liked to hear a bit more from one character in particular on why he made the decisions he did but either way he was still a great villain so to some this review up this was one of the most badass and crazy action films of this decade its up there with john wick and fury road for sure additionally its the best of the mission impossible series and every new installment just keeps getting better 9510

Jul 12 2018,positive,saw it five times so nuff said
Jul 12 2018,positive,it has all the absurdity you want from these films but to a more impressive extent in its action sequences the fight scenes are slick inventive and quite beautiful in the way theyre shot like all the mission impossible films the story is just a shitload of heightened nonsense with not a ton of emotional payoff but as for turning your brain off for 2 and a half hours and partaking in blockbuster bliss this is about as satisfying as they come

Jul 11 2018,positive,here is my suggestion before you watch the new mission impossible fall out go see the last one first mission impossible rogue nation there are a few key players it would help if you was the one before is it necessary no but it would help make the movie more enjoyable and my rating is 45 stars out of 5
Jul 11 2018,positive,tom cruises raw dedication as an actor and a stuntman carry through every film and since these latest films also have such good plots the action sequences only feel that more riveting fallout is the epitome of a great action movie and cruise keeps doing the impossible and pushing his limits as a performer which i have a deep respect for

Jul 4 2018,positive,not only is mission impossible  fallout the best mission impossible yet it sets a new bar for action films with its practical effects and of course tom cruise 
Jul 2 2018,positive,in fallout we see mcquarrie and cruise team up for a second time in the franchise and this time they go bigger than any mission has yet where most blockbusters seek to set the tone of their film by smashing together highend vfx to get their audience engaged fallout chooses a more brisk easygoing and familiar path to calm the audience before the storm that storm being a heartpounding thrill ride for 120 continuous minutes with countless twists turns and stomach lurches that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat that may sound unappetizing for those seeking substance underneath the style but rest assured mcquarrie takes care of the characters and the story with ease many action films today become bogged down in lofty weightless ambitions that never give action scenes true value in their design here there are moments where you can breathe easy albeit brief but those moments only enhance the spectacle its something that few action films have achieved throughout the course of cinema history but its something that mcquarrie has excelled in both times whats most rewarding about fallout besides the outstanding setpieces and world class technical work is the character work being the sixth film in the franchise its hard to wrap your head around the idea that mcquarrie has found a way to continuously make the characters interesting many of the relationships we see have already been founded established and built but there are always complications that blocks ethans path to success thus giving the audience newer dimensions to explore with the face of the franchise that face of the franchise being the method in the method behind the madness because fallouts action scenes are monumental many films try their hand at a halo jump sequence but none even come close to what is accomplished here then you think youve seen it all and mcquarrie cruise and the rest of the crew go one step and one punch further by channeling their inner bond to deliver a brutal bathroom brawl only to then be oneupped by a sequence in paris that is choreographed with unparalleled precision that it makes any chase scene youve seen prior look like a walk in the park theres a slight hyperbole to that statement but its that damn good and i havent even mentioned the helicopter sequence there is so much happening within fallout but its all focused directed and choreographed in the most rewarding way imaginable the action is superb but without the finely tuned character work they simply do not excel at the degree in which they do as youve read mission impossible  fallout is everything you anticipated it to be and then some it was hard to envision a reality in which a film could rival george millers mad max fury road in terms of scale artistry precision and stunt work back when it released in 2015 but fallout fights for the top spot in many ways you can see that mcquarrie was inspired by fury road in how that film uses diegetic or nondiegetic music to amplify tension many boisterous and bombastic tunes are composed by lorne balfe but he always reigns it back in with soft calming tracks to keep the tension and heart hand in hand alongside that we see cinematographers rob hardy and hugues espinasse tighten their focus on each roar of a motorcycle or whipping of helicopter blades the camerawork is constantly playing your heart like a drum and christopher mcquarrie guides it into the holy land of action films throughout the film you can see the utmost respect mcquarrie has to previous staples of the genre by sprinkling in homages to old jackie chan films james bond films and works as recent as the raid recognizing that mission impossible would not be where it is without the grandfathers of the genre films like mission impossible  fallout are a once in a franchise type of achievement and it like cruise are showing no signs of slowing down its a harmonious action symphony for the record books that is filled to the brim with deathdefying stunts layered character work and a mountainous celebration of the mission impossible franchise mission accomplished mission impossible  fallout gets a 98100

Jun 12 2018,positive,good morningafternoonevening fellow film spectatormovie viewer your optional mission should you choose to accept it is more of a recommendation that involves riding on the added set pieces of tracks that furthers the ride of a franchise known under mission impossible if you have ridden through the first five missions particularly the fifth and essentially the first and third  basically the oddnumbered missions  you should feel that the sixth mission under operation fallout had heightened the adrenaline and complexity under the constant push over the last    heres the lowdown of whats happening after a mission gone wrong because of good intentions the choices comes back to haunt and tests agent ethan hunt and the remaining available members of his imf team conflicted with familiar allies while being monitored by the accompanied cia agent it becomes a race against time of overcoming obstacles that questions those usual motives to resolve the human error that would really put the world at risk    director christopher mcquarrie has been steering the franchises wheel for two missions since the fifth which is more than those who previously helmed the past missions as mostly oneshots mcquarries constant direction between the two missions has gotten a little heavier when still further pushing testing and questioning what the filmic missions and tactics stands for while also involving more personal stuff into the characters the said push resulted in the aforementioned heightened complexity through thoroughly thoughtout intelligence still pulling out twists and turns as well planning out the action sequences to generate thrills as adrenalines the main component to the push the stylistic and subtly dramatic approach also went onto new testing grounds for the action genre    singlehandedly grasping the adrenaline tom cruise continues his usual risky take as an action movie star thats astonishingly gripping with tighter and larger space delivered by taut cinematography in expressing the aura of the individual situation but when hes not straining his muscles in stunts he still performs almost at a same level in strength with his known casual charm    in addition to cruises energy as part of the operation directions furthering things particularly the emphasis on the inner and outer importance of the characters the rest of the cast most of them returned from few previous missions followed well along that line of minimum expectation that cruise set henry cavill joins the team by literally punching into the game in attempt to credit the wellchoreographed action with equivalent rivalry formation and reflective suspicion as part of a partially predictable twist till the confirmation around the surprising turning point returning from the previous mission rebecca ferguson continues the favorable aspect surrounding her character while fulfilling anothers half and breaking more of a barrier that improves the franchises taste in casting    should you or any of your party not find the time to experience whats being agreeably hailed as the best mission yet in the practical action franchise that seems to glorified the genre knowledge of your decided actions will not be disavowed but to your own under the shrunken effect that tightens mission impossible  fallout to the acceptable minimum that will still deliver the thrills and intelligence this review will selfdestruct if something occurs in your present device that would make this unavailable have fun experiencing the thrill a
Jun 11 2018,positive,he has trained hard i give him respect by watching the film
Jun 10 2018,positive,mission impossible fallout is quite possibly the best mission impossible movie ever made the story is a little predictable but its action scenes are amazing and the story has curveballs which are ultimately satisfying
Jun 10 2018,positive,beginning was a little slow but as the movie progressed it got better great ending 
Jun 9 2018,positive,one of the best movies of all time and the best action film period i was on the edge of my seat the entire time i could go on for hours about this film but you have to see it to believe it 
Jun 8 2018,positive,thebestmission impossible movieever
Jun 7 2018,positive,mission impossiblefallout is not the best action movie but it comes damn close it definitely is the best mission impossible movie and tom cruise is a star no two ways bout it damn the lengths hes gone to to entertain us if nothing else watch it just for that

Jun 6 2018,neutral,the action sequences were brilliantly shot but the plot was predictable the dialogue terrible and the film just way too long i dont get all the love this is the weakest mi entry in a long time
Jun 5 2018,positive,abit long and confusing 
Jun 5 2018,positive,mission  impossible  fallout is the best film in the series the second best film of 2018 and one of the best action films of all time
Jun 5 2018,positive,once they revealed the faces under the masks about 1hr15min in then it got very entertaining first half was a bore
Jun 5 2018,positive,fantastic action thriller best of the series
Jun 4 2018,positive,best one yet mi and tc deliver again i hopetheyre one more
Jun 4 2018,positive,one of the best action movies i ever seen and the best spy movie i have ever seen the cinematography was done fantastically the fight and action scenes were amazing the stunts that tom cruise performed were insane and awesome tom cruises performance was stupendous rebecca ferguson ving rhames henry cavill and simon pegg also have great performances i also loved the moments of comic relief the movie score was also spectacular a from me
Jun 3 2018,positive,pretty good for a sequel rather good action sequences worth the watch in theater
Jun 2 2018,positive,not my favorite but not bad 
Jun 2 2018,neutral,action scenes were great but everything else was really ok i liked how they used the face masks and staged during certain scenes but it felt like nothing more than another mi sequel
Jun 1 2018,positive, this film had so many plot twist i did not see coming this film really had some great action stunts it is so crazy the locations in this film stood out more than some other locations i think this film had so many twist i feel like this film got much better with alec baldwin we got to see alec baldwin do different things than we saw him do in rogue nation this was great to see on the big screen there was so much to see in those wide shots i dont think that this film was as good as rogue nation or ghost protocol as far as story i really enjoy this film and will purchase it and recommend others to see it i did not like the music as much in this film as in rogue nation ghost protocol mission impossible iii or mission impossible i thought this film was interesting how they had so many different sides going after a single goal like the cia british intelligence aka mi6 mission impossible force plus the villains i really liked the the stunts like the helicopter chase or the bathroom the bathroom stunts were crazy intense what was unique was how the guy they were fighting was shown as a better fighter than tom cruise as ethan hunt or henry cavils character  this film did a great job on henry cavil as superman without questioning him as superman i think that the mustache and the way the character was written worked in this film i also liked that this film had a group that was an in between group that was working for the white widow that was an interesting twist seeing a group not working for a country but working for an inbetween group i like how this film dealt with getting the bad guy out this film was missing the comedy like in rogue nation or ghost protocol there was not as much comedy in this film either from dialog lines or physical comedy so in that sense this film missed it as far as the fun aspect i thought this film was interesting in how they went about introducing emma faust to the story i liked her entrance in the film i like how the masks were used in this film i also enjoyed how the mission impossible recording was done in a iliad and the odyssey book i feel like having the girl from the 3rd mission impossible film was not done well enough in fallout as it could have been just because her screen time was so minimal i will say i enjoyed this film a lot but not as much as mission impossible films 35 
May 31 2018,positive,slick and streamlined script incredible stunts and action heart and humor too this movie grabs on from the first minute and never lets go
May 31 2018,positive,tom cruise continues to impress impressive stunts all done by tom cruise and excellent set pieces 
May 31 2018,positive,i dont know how they keep getting better with every movie but they do
May 31 2018,positive,just from one scene to the next this movie kept me on the edge of my seat with its action the helicopter crash was a bit unbelievable but the closing act was amazing ethan hunt never stops and never compromises he achieves the impossible
May 31 2018,positive,action packed smart and an extreme thrill ride mission impossible is a rare 6th instalment of a franchise that in my opinion out does all its previous instalments by building upon the long already working formula of good writing high stakes and fun and little mystery and plot twist and ive course dramatic action sequences that are mind blowing to watch that conform to one hell of a ride
May 30 2018,positive,its a solid 6 movie in the mi franchise liked the one before a little better some of the chasing scenes where way too long
May 29 2018,positive,not as good as mi4 though but is worthy of watching superman was running out of jobs and in need of money i guess
May 29 2018,positive,great movie as are all the mi movies just love the endless action and chase scenes so fun to watch and never gets old 
May 26 2018,positive,absolutely action field and phenomenally done
May 26 2018,positive,the best of 2018 hands down right when i thought they couldnt top the previous action scene i was excitingly wrong dont miss this one 
May 25 2018,neutral,tom is getting old a new ethan hunt is needed
May 23 2018,positive,a 10 is pushing it a bit for my love of tom i would drop it a few notches only cause the plot gets a little blury with too many twists and turns overall tom deliveries and the action and cast is top notchi would see it again for 2 hours and 20 minutes no dead stops
May 22 2018,positive,i dont give 5 starsbut i had to make an exception the best of the mi movies
May 21 2018,positive,as entertaining as the others with a twist i didnt see coming  which is unusual for me but i also wasnt expecting something like that from an mi movie 
May 21 2018,positive,great movie these mi movies just keep getting better and better
May 21 2018,positive,maybe the best installment in the series def an amazing cinematic experience
May 18 2018,positive,i think i like last one better  but lots of fun  twists and a super long car chase  cruise is great in these
May 17 2018,positive,beyond good  i love that tom cruise hasnt had work done it just adds authenticity to what hes doing up there hes like harrison ford was at this age but better   theres moments were he gets this look on his face like a dad does when he comes home from work and his 7yearold tells him hes got to go to staples to get supplies for his science project due tomorrow that distracted  okay im working but i gotta handle this first look  tim cruise i mean hes just the best
May 16 2018,positive,one of the best mission impossible movies ive ever seen i was on the edge of my seat the entire time also since i have gone skydiving i can totally appreciate his halo jump from the airplane knowing he did that for real really pushed me on the edge of my seat this thing had so much action i also liked the story in terms of his wife and this other person who liked him loved it
May 16 2018,positive,amazing best movie this year 
May 15 2018,negative,worst movie ive ever watched idiotic cliche plot the fact it had a 97 critic rating and 89 audience rating means the idiocracy future world has arrived
May 14 2018,positive,loved it very entertaining a must see blockbuster 
May 14 2018,positive,literally on the edge of my seat the entire freaking time insanely intense movie and the action sequences were top notch tom cruise never disappoints love this series
May 12 2018,negative,tom cruise is not a good actor why is he still making movies why is he allowed to hes old and gross and honestly kills movies for me this franchise needs to put him out to pasture and let someone who can act and is appealing take over 
May 12 2018,positive,a great addition to the mi franchise entertaining from start to finish 
May 12 2018,positive,mission impossible 6 has a breathtaking beginning an acton packed middle and the ending that fans hoped would happen mission impossible has been a series with its flaws mi6 makes up for that with the best action movie of the year
May 11 2018,positive,an intense action epic brimming with thrills    christopher mcquarrie directs an action film that is massive in scope ambitious in realism and stunning in execution fallout goes to multiple exotic locales shot beautifully and with memorable cinematography the stunt work is immaculate with real stunts executed by tom cruise the halo jump is breathtaking the bathroom fight is cool and the gunplay is visceral the fight choreography is brutal and feels like the punches have weight    tom cruise is the main draw as always his dedication to performing the stunts for real is admirable but his dramatic acting as ethan hunt is still my favorite part cruise is the ultimate action star but also an accomplished dramatic actor he runs all over the world jumps from roof to roof actually flies a helicopter jumps from a plane fights men in hand to hand combat and shoots firearms constantly in the most exhilarating mission impossible film yet i may prefer ghost protocol more still but fallout is a close second for the best mission impossible movie for sure    the supporting cast is particularly notable this time around with excellent performances all around cruises ethan hunt is offset well by the always  hilarious simon pegg as benji who finally gets more to do in the franchise newcomer henry cavill is intimidating and formidable as august walker cavill holds his own both in combat and drama alike     surprisingly ving rhames is not only back but he also gets to deliver more weighted dramatic dialogue i really liked his performance here he carries himself with an earnest concern for ethan as well as a likable presence as luther stickell likewise alec baldwin has a brief but incredibly memorable role reprising his part as alan hunley youll like him in fallout     similarly rebecca ferguson kills it again as ilsa faust she is cool smart and interesting as ethan hunts foil and love interest i wish there were even more of ferguson she could easily play the lead in the next movie next michelle monaghan makes a neat cameo with some serious lines and a touching delivery i was disappointed that her character goes in the direction they went with but i understand lastly for the ladies angela bassett gets a small but integral role as the head of the cia erica sloane i hope she appears in more mission impossible movies    in regards to the villains sean harris is frightening and monstrous as solomon lane harris is even scarier than he was in rogue nation also vanessa kirby is sultry and intriguing as white widow i wonder if theyll bring her back as she has potential for more on screen crime she is pleasantly good in fallout overall the entire ensemble is excellently well cast and aptly utilized     all in all you will be entertained by fallout i think there is plenty here for any audience fast paced action character progression enjoyable dialogue intriguing story clever fake outs and funny jokes fallout is phenomenal
May 10 2018,positive,3rd best of the franchise in terms of stories but one of the most entertaining nonetheless the twists and great action were the highlights henry cavill is the only let down and the end is a bit head smacking
May 9 2018,positive,the best mission to date
May 8 2018,positive,one of the greatest action films of all time 
May 7 2018,positive,its really good  time is catching up to tom but he is still physically doing things that guys half his age would have problems with the action stunts amazing the sound track was cool and the story over the top fun imo
May 7 2018,positive,incredibly well crafted tom cruise is the definitive action star
May 5 2018,negative,tom needs to stop making these moviesmove on the rest of the cast did a good job but his performance your could have cut and pasted from all the other mission moviestime to do something different
May 3 2018,positive,hey it is a mission impossible film  so its fun action packed lots of explosions fights chases and needed to be 20 minutes shorter  enjoyable all things considered but starting to get long in the tooth  time to pass the reins
Apr 28 2018,positive,everything is too big and it feels clumsy in its extravaganza its why its so fun nothing more nothing less

Apr 12 2018,positive,best one yet this franchise is setting the bar for action movies 
Apr 4 2018,positive,mi films have a formula 1 world in jeopardy plot line  check 2 tom cruise doing his own increasingly ott stunts  check 3 very well executed chase fight shoot crash a helicopter sequences  check 4 simon pegg and ving rhames bringing the lighter comedic moments  check   if the formula aint broke it doesnt need fixing
Mar 30 2018,positive,mission impossible  fallout is an outstanding action movie spectacle that stands among in this now sixpart series the story in the movie does feel like a rehash of previously done movies in this genre but the movie handles it with great creativity when it comes to its action scenes every fight chase shootout or exchange of dialogue leads to a twist or develops the surprisingly complex storyline the movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat i truly believe this franchise is currently tom cruises best work in his career his dedication to the stuntwork in these movies is just extraordinary  i liked seeing the characters ive seen in previous entries again and henry cavill was a fun addition the movie is among the best of the summer and even of the year its a ton of fun and only left me wanting even more from this franchise and these characters this movie is a love letter to action movie junkies because every action scene is essentially flawless

Jan 18 2018,positive,as the 6th installment of the mission impossible franchise directorwriter christopher mcquarrie and tom cruise outdid the previous installment in spectacular fashion thank god for the marketing campaign not revealing a single thing about the major story of the film from robbing the cia to climbing a canyon to getting blown into a car by an explosion to climbing the burj khalifa to hanging on a flying aircraft to  tom cruise never gives up tom cruise shines again in 20 years of a nonstop actionpacked spy franchise as ethan hunt the man does his own stunts people he even broke his ankle and kept running this movie is bloated with action dialogue emotions suspense amazing performances stunts and action its not just the stunts the acting mcqs direction  the action is also choreographed with rob hardys cinematography the halo jump the vehicularmotorcycle chase in paris the foot chase and helicopter chase its everywhere this movie is very emotional its emotional that it tears you apart just like how it tore me apart in the theater its full of twist and turns obviously and halloween masks its been only three years since mad max fury road and fallout outdid it best movie of 2018 9410
Jan 14 2018,positive,with jaw dropping stunts incredible sfx and a cast that still has you on the edge of your seat six films in mif is bloody brilliant you can feel every punch you will gasp at every stunt and the story is still one that gets you gripped if cruise does one saga until he retires let it be this its a spectacle from beginning to end 
Dec 27 2017,positive,95100  i initially didnt know what to think of this movie i knew it was a damn good movie but was it 45 stars or 5 stars what pushed me over the edge of giving it 5 stars were definitely the action sequences so lets talk about those this movie has one of the most exhilarating and intense action sequences of the past decades what you should know going into this movie is that tom cruise practically did all of his own stunts the helicopter chase the jumping over buildings escaping on a motorcycle on a busy street everything was tom cruise the story too is phenomenal solomon lane sean harris returning was a really good part of the continuity between these movies the situations these characters are brought in and how they react to those situations is truly in there own character and all of it is executed very well some of the dialogue was a bit choppy and didnt feel right talking about angela bassett here but still this is the perfect action movie and definitely one of the best action movies of the past decade the soundtrack by lorne balfe is also excellent and feels so epic with so much tension for an action movie the fight scenes and the choreography in them was also amazing especially the bathroom fight those punches look and feel real the cinematography is also very good rob hardy is really making a name for himself overall i just really loved this movie please go see it
Dec 26 2017,positive,smart slick intense filled with twists and action packed get you on the edge of your seat and remove the predictability factor that described these films through the years and serves well as the first actual sequel by its subplots and characters to the previous films a great and highly addition to the spy genre and one of the best films of 2018

Jun 20 2016,positive,if action is what you want this summer well congratulations  youre in luck since the original tv show and de palmas first movie mission impossible has undergone a vast evolution whereas the series was more of a thriller before it has now become an allout action extravaganza far more focused on car chases fistfights and deathdefying stunts than it is on story this has its ups and downs with the plot in particular  for the most part a typical twistyturney nuclear weapon end of the world type deal  easy to criticise nonetheless although its clearly just glue between setpieces mcquarrie is a talented enough writer to make it interesting and as far as action goes fallout is leaps and bounds above pretty much every other action franchise around even though i dont think it has any sequences on par with the burj khalifa scene in ghost protocol nor the opera scene in rogue nation a whiteknuckled bathroom fight an amazing motorcycle chase and a bevy of other vehicular madness ensures you are left gripping your seat for a good proportion of the runtime    fallout is undoubtedly a technical masterpiece and another great addition to the franchise in keeping with the previous two instalments as far as summer blockbusters go this is pretty much perfect i do however think the series is coming to a point where  if it wishes to continue  it needs to be reinvented once again for the first time in quite a while i felt like the formula was starting to show just a little they changed it up in ghost protocol lets hope they can do it again
