Mar 31 2024,positive,50 audience score is mad i loved this movie although it has a very long runtime and has a slow beginning  it makes up for it with lots of fun action scenes and big monke
Mar 30 2024,positive,watch the extended 3 hour version for all the wonderful touches but definitely a labor of love from peter jackson loved it
Mar 28 2024,positive,very amazing movie maybe a little slow but i truly loved
Mar 14 2024,positive,ok so maybe not perfect  and most of you younguns probably wont know what im talking about but i still had a really bad taste in my mouth from that jeff bridges version way back when and this rinsed that out nicely
Mar 3 2024,positive,beautiful cgi for the time it was made there is a scene for about 3040 minutes in the middle where your on the edge of your seat the entire time naomi watts is a show stopper was a bit long but it worked
Mar 1 2024,positive,0ne of the greatest movies ever created
Feb 25 2024,negative,why wound you make an overlong inferior version of a 1933 classic film
Jan 27 2024,positive,truly one of the greatest remakes ever peter jackson made the classic ape story a grand scale adventure with so much heart and outstanding visual effects naomi watts shines as the beauty that tames the beast and was a worthy successor to fay wray
Jan 22 2024,positive,a classic in its own right dont listen to the low reviewers they wouldnt know a good film if it smacked them in the face
Jan 16 2024,positive,this is one of my favorite kong and peter jackson films without a doubt what is wrong with some of you people who hate this masterpiece
Jan 5 2024,positive,peter jacksons king kong to this day is the best kong related film to be released this film captures the beauty and thrill of the original and goes above and beyond exceeding it this is a beautiful story of unexpected love with an underlying theme of man vs nature every character is beautiful written and the cgi of kong still holds up to this day despite it being made in 2005 this will forever be my favorite movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,this movie isnt stupid people youre stupid
Dec 19 2023,positive,an awsome reboot of the classic giant ape on monster island it brings the drama and horror perfectly
Dec 13 2023,positive,there are certain things here that absolutely do not work from the screenplay to the performances and even the special effects but within those elements enough greatness still exists so i am willing to forgive the flaws naomi watts might be the key here as she sells the more overtly tragic retelling of the story also  the whole section on the island remains one of the most thrilling series of sequences of the 21st century
Dec 2 2023,positive,pretty good     
Dec 1 2023,negative,this is not a good movie i have no idea how this flick gets 84 besides some nice cgi effects it must be the most illogical and flawed movie ever when it comes to action scenes and stuff that should physically be right
Nov 17 2023,positive,i dont understand why they hated this film but its good the cgi has aged very well since 2005 the protagonist isnt great id even say shes bad but that doesnt affect the film that much because the direction is sensational when kong leaves the theater its so good theres some tearjerking photography things like the tribe and the culture of feeding kong i dont think is so good because its just very slow and drags the film i give it 710
Sep 27 2023,positive,awesome film peter jackson is great at his job saw this when i was little but it was too scary at the time decided to revist it one of the best decisions i made in a month
Sep 24 2023,positive,i was surprised to see the amount of negative feedback on this movie from audiences reviewing this movie so recent some as recent as 2023 and complaining about cgi effects of course cgi has gotten much better since 2005 thats not rocket science nobody complains about the effects in jurassic park an amazing film by the way because its easy to remember when the film was made and how it had an incredible impact on future film making even though it looks poor compared to effects now i believe the cgi in jacksons king kong was amazing for its time and we should be rating movies based on when they were made when its comes to effects its easy to go from watching the newest marvel movie then to king kong and complaining about the difference in cgi effects but its very obvious that time has had a lot to do with the improvement between one film and the other     second the film is long but its incredibly action packed and fun to watch its not a deep film but its enjoyable nonetheless some scenes could have been cut shorter that i felt dragged on but this wasnt a deal breaker by any means character development with the people could have been a little better but the action makes up for that however i felt they did a great job at making king kong believable as a giant gorilla his small mannerisms were done well he has a lot of emotion and personality throughout the film one which resembles a real gorilla obviously some of these expressions are exaggerated as he is supposed to be this monster and king of skull island but they still did a great job of giving kong a true personality with more character development than some other monsters in other films you can see some amount of thought process with his character in certain moments which was nice character development for the monster of the film a nice change from the cliche chase kill eat in every single situation     third i felt the film did give a lot of screen time to the monsters often in movies similar to this one the monsters dinosaurs etc get very little screen time where they are full body and long enough to actually see this movie gives plenty of time to get a good look at these strange creatures living on skull island     overall the movie is pretty good for its time and for monster movie lovers its one of the better ones out there i would recommend
Sep 17 2023,negative,this movie was a boring overtly long dark and violent a waste of time
Aug 24 2023,positive,king kong is too long but still a good story its the classic version of the giant gorilla made as dramatic as possible the drama mostly pays off but sometimes it feels like overkill
Aug 8 2023,positive,how is the audience score for this so low it isnt dumb fun enough no patience to watch a 3 hour movie
Aug 2 2023,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie its great cgi but its 3 hours long thats little to long for me but its still very good
Jul 17 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever
Jul 13 2023,positive,great movie that is very under rated it may be a bit long but is very fun
Jul 12 2023,negative,this overlong mess is a completely unnecessary addition to the kong mythos with dull onenote characters and a runtime too long for the story and for an apt attention span the only redeeming feature is jack black and andy serkis it takes all the magic and flair of the original and stretches it to its absolute limit removing all the charm from the story for a boring slog that takes too long to get going and then too long to finish it doesnt know when to stop loving its special effects providing an experience that feels as uninteresting as it is long    the three hour runtime does it no favours
Jun 29 2023,positive,its sad but still has 
Jun 20 2023,positive,a thoroughly entertaining remake of a classic story the cgi is brilliant but naomi watts is the real star here  it is a long movie and could of been a bit shorter
May 15 2023,positive,a great reimagining of the classic film king kong is the perfect monster movie besides godzilla 2014
May 14 2023,positive,i love the film with trex
May 7 2023,positive,monkey
May 4 2023,positive,the greatest 03 hours and 07 minutes ever
Apr 21 2023,positive,i dont get at all why people hate this i personally think its of the greatest movies i have ever seen  and ive seen godfather parts i  ii apocalypse now my favorite film shawshank dark knight fight club and it lives up all of them  like the lotr trilogy jackson clearly put his heart and soul into this film and final result was breathtaking only id be one of the few to the big ape was the better film
Apr 14 2023,positive,this movie i have always loved and always willit has everything i love  dinosaurscreauturesamazing cgi and morethe dinosaur battle was just iconic and one of my alltime favorite movie scenes ever
Apr 13 2023,positive,i had a lot of fun with this one
Mar 22 2023,positive,watched it in theaters and thought it was pretty good but upon rewatch its actually kinda weird
Mar 9 2023,positive,let me start by saying that this film is a true spectacle of special effects and action sequences the cgi is outstanding with king kong himself being brought to life in a stunning and believable manner the battles between kong and the various creatures on skull island are nothing short of epic and the final showdown in new york city is a sight to behold    the plot follows filmmaker carl denham played by jack black who sets out on an expedition to the mysterious skull island to shoot his latest movie along the way he meets ann darrow played by naomi watts who becomes the object of kongs affection the relationship between ann and kong is one of the films strongest points with their bond being both touching and tragic the performances of the cast are also noteworthy jack black delivers a solid performance as the ambitious and selfish carl denham while naomi watts shines as the vulnerable and compassionate ann darrow the supporting cast which includes adrien brody and colin hanks also delivers strong performances    one criticism that could be leveled at the film is its length at over three hours it does feel a bit bloated at times with some scenes feeling unnecessary or drawnout however this is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things    overall king kong is a thrilling and emotionallycharged adventure that is sure to entertain the special effects are topnotch the performances are strong and the story is engaging if youre a fan of actionadventure movies then this one is definitely worth watching
Mar 6 2023,positive,i do like this movie this is a loving tribute to the original king kong and it is an entertaining  kong film but not as good as the original king kong
Feb 27 2023,positive,awesome loved it all from start to finish
Feb 26 2023,positive,excellent movie great storyline and characters one of the alltime greats
Feb 24 2023,positive,king kong 2005 is beautiful to watch naomi watts and andy serkis deliver some of their career best performances while it can be slow and drawn out in parts with maybe some choppy dialogue here and there james newtonhowards original score the visuals and the emotional punch delivered beautifully at the end by the two leads will leave you crying regardless
Feb 24 2023,positive,decent but personally i preferred skull island more
Feb 7 2023,positive,great film with a lot of respect for the original the acting was very good overall especially with watts being the highlight the cinematography is good as well with lots of creative shts that have great action and epic scope to them the only problem is the cgi at times especially during the stampede looks awful though kong himself is amazing to look at great music but not exactly catchy or memorable the editing and pacing are good but this shouldnt have been 3 hours things do drag in the middle hunting for ann as this doesnt have the frantic pacing of the original and takes its time setting up the next encounter which has mixed results though the trex fight was awesome this film does a better job in the first half building characters and going into more detail from start to getting to skull island the finale is good also especially the stampede which is well done despite oversaturation of cg at times definitely give this a watch if your a fan of jackson any of the actors in this adventure or monster films its a great time and worth the 3 hour watch at least once
Jan 31 2023,neutral,it was okay not a big fan
Jan 30 2023,positive,i think is a great film full of challenges adrenaline surprises and thrilling
Jan 29 2023,positive,it hard to believe the audience response to this movie usually these days its the critics who cant be taken seriously perhaps most people cant stay focussed for 3 hours or theyve seen some many bad movies they dont know what an excellent movie looks like either way i weep for the future
Jan 28 2023,positive,peter jacksons epic remake of the classic monster movie is a grand display of filmmaking wizardry and fantasy craftsmanship after tlotr trilogy jackson delivered yet another masterpiece of massive scope heart action scares perfection
Jan 17 2023,positive,honestly i think it was a pretty good movie king kong looked amazing the casting was pretty spot on the cgi was a lot more realistic than i thought it would be overall not bad at all
Jan 17 2023,positive,this remake is very good  the acting is well done with special effects out the wazoo  the movie is still a tearjerker despite being a bit too long
Jan 11 2023,positive,very entertaining and thrilling movie not sure why the low audience score

Jan 4 2023,positive,this movie was amazing i love the actions and challenges they went through it really shows the hardship of love
Dec 27 2022,positive,featuring stateoftheart special effects terrific performances and a majestic sense of spectacle peter jacksons remake of king kong is a potent epic thats faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original
Dec 14 2022,positive,the overall story wasnt that great with a ton of action but the final act was amazing
Dec 11 2022,positive,my favorite version of the classic great action and effects
Nov 30 2022,positive,beautiful  i wrote this opening day and now would like to include it here at imdb    king kong a remake action drama thriller comedy epic 3 hour film only peter jackson could hold an audiences attention for 3 whole hours the communication between kong and ann is very cool and funny naomi watts is great in this but the real star is king kong his realistic movement and expression is amazing the effects are great best ive seen ever you can surely tell that peter jackson was the director just by the way he films and shows the landscape he gives us an amazing visual experience that only he could accomplish    i saw the advanced screening of this and it wore me out the first part has jack blacks character carl denham naomi watts as ann darow and adrien brody as jack driscoll they are all hurried by carl to skull island on a ship they eventually arrive at skull island in a storm literally they crash into some rocks in arrival and there are wave effects which blew my mind    the make up of the islanders is hideous but very neat and gets the audiences attention ann is taken captive by the natives in a very dark and exciting way but not so much memorable since it is outdone by the next 2 hours she is lowered to the ground in a way that will amaze you kong shows up and is attracted to ann this relationship between human and creature has never been done on such a levelthe part where kong fights the crew on the large log is classic the capture of king kong is incredibly better than i expected and my expectations are always high in movies there are some emotional moments for ann here as she is in love with both guys who saved her life    rampaging around new york lifting cars buses and women who look like naomi watts but never finding her pure movie magic this is the kind of film that comes only once every few years the finale scene atop the empire state building is just grand    overall king kong is for sure the best movie this year each action scene out does the one prior the characters are emotionally convincing the ending is sad even though it has been done time and time again the action has never been done on this level the lord of the rings is just as great a movie but isnt at all like king kong they are entirely different compared to the 1933 version king kong is faithful in plot many of the lines stay the same also king kong will be adored by audiences there will be applause best movie must see i laughed cried stunned    also cant wait for the extended version maybe there will be a few parts included that were in the 1933 original
Nov 26 2022,positive,the best production design ever made in a movie with the best sound mixing ever done in a movie plus the best sound editing ever done in a movie and the best visual effects ever made in a movie
Nov 1 2022,positive, a more depressing version even if it is one of the best they make you like kong in this version just for the same ending its also longer and epic just to get the same ending as any king kong film
Oct 29 2022,neutral,on skull island kong is not the monster there there is a lot worst
Sep 29 2022,negative,i really did not like this filmthe effects were over the top and it just felt off i guesswhile i get that the relationship is suppose to be fake between kong and ann i really dont like how theyre obsessed with one anothernot for me410
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 18 2022,positive,loved this movie since i was a little kid one of the greatest
Sep 4 2022,positive,incredible special effects and powerful performances jacksons remake of king kong stays loyal to the 1930s kong but bringing it alive into the modern generation of people
Jul 31 2022,positive,how do you honor a legendary story like king kong well you create a 3 hour 10 minute movie that is full of emotion full of suspense and full of heart
Jul 13 2022,positive,perfect story great casting and the vfx is so amazing
Jul 8 2022,positive,what is that audience score critics easily correct on this one
Jun 28 2022,positive,love this movie watchin a trex duo go after it with the ultimate ape love it
May 28 2022,positive,very interesting and if you love king kong this is for you
Apr 28 2022,positive,sonic and sonic is the king of lord king evil king
Apr 26 2022,positive,to fully get this movie you must realize that it is highly selfreferential  it is a hollywood blockbuster about a madman who relentlessly chases down a hollywood blockbuster  mystery for the price of admission and killing the thing you love are two quotes main themes  while we are lapping up the spectacle the spectacle is being deconstructed as a farce and a tragedy  it is also about how we use movies to address those things that are too big in our lives that are beyond our control that is the power and mystery of our reality and try to make it digestible into something we can watch and not have to close our eyes  if one person can see what no one else sees if one person is relentless enough if one person realizes before its too latewe can all put ourselves into one of these roles and feel chastised or cleansed by it  and the adreneline that this movie slowly builds up to is the perfect sort of vehicle to suck you in to stop your thinkingjustification and just feel  nothing is accomplished without great sacrifice and in the end no sacrifice was worth it  in the end king kong is not the biggest monster in this film
Apr 4 2022,positive,while there were quite a few things in the film that i didnt care for such as the whole first act with them getting on the boat the stupid dinosaur chase sequences in which everyone should have died the over the top and unnecessary hollywood dramatization the length and a few shots of bad cgi material i did like the humanization of kong and how the stockholm syndrome angle of the story played itself out the entire ending was satisfying and i also liked a lot of the action in the movie as always brilliant motion capture work from andy serkis
Mar 17 2022,positive,i do agree with anyone who says that the 2005 film isnt as good as the 1933 classic but i did think it was very good many complained of the first hour or so being too slow but i didnt find that the stunning cinematography actually more than compensated and throughout the movie naomi watts is a delight as ann darrow jack black was an admittedly odd choice as carl denham but he still manages a worthwhile performance although kong doesnt appear until an hour and a quarter into the movie he was flawlessly designed and credit also must go to andy serkis for performing him as he did a fantastic job in fact the only weak performance comes from adrien brody his performance was a little too wimpy for my liking the film is superbly designed with the amount of detail evident and the direction from peter jackson was excellent however i was disturbed by a number of scenes like any part with the aborigines and when that flower thing sucked that mans face my other criticism of the movie was that although the scenes with ann and kong were well handled on the most part i found the ice skating bit a bit too slushy and unconvincing despite the flaws king kong may have it was still a very good film that i will happily award a 710 bethany cox
Feb 17 2022,neutral,big monke scary              no
Feb 16 2022,positive,absolute and utter masterpiece without question the best king kong film the 50 score is a joke i prefer this over tlotr i prefer monster movies over fantasy movies anyway
Feb 12 2022,positive,the best version of king kongs story ever put to screen the effects the tension the payoff the performance by naomi  watts yes yes and yes although the brontosaurus stampede doesnt age so well but definitely a must watch
Feb 7 2022,positive,a classic monke origins
Feb 3 2022,positive,this film is an amazing childhood memory would totally recommend it
Dec 27 2021,positive,this movie really is epiceven at 3 hours never does this film become dull or boringjack black naiomi watts and adrian brody play excellent roles and great special effects an absolute must see
Dec 17 2021,positive,this movie is amazing
Oct 8 2021,positive,one of the best monster movies out there peter jackson absolutely knocked it out of the park there are alot of big action set pieces with dinosaurs giant bugs mutant bats and of course those terrifying nativeshead hunters they still give me chills to this day the cgi is impressive and still looks better than most modern movies kongs fight with the three vrexes is out of this world as far as remakes go his has to be among the best of them
Oct 8 2021,negative,honestly this movie is a semidecent 80 minute at best blown up to 180 minutes in total  it does feature some moments of genuine mood and some decent spectacle and naomi watts was fantastic in a dual comedic and dramatic role  but this movie is just so drawn out and padded out to extreme degrees with material that is ultimately meaningless  heck id just outandout call the first hour of the movie outright bad  almost outright terrible  it wouldve been cool if this movie was a reimagining of the original kong story giving it a reason to be over 3 hours long but this is literally just a beatforbeat retelling just with double the runtime  this movie also makes the same mistake that all other king kong movies make however and that is to try to make us feel immense sorrow for this giant murderous beast right after going on a massive killing spree  while i was more sympathetic toward this kong than i was to the one from the original i still wasnt sad when he ultimately met his end as he was even before being kidnapped an extremely volatile creature  if youre interested in seeing it i suppose you could but honestly i saw it once and i am good it was drab lifeless and felt like it would never end
Oct 5 2021,positive,the story is very good  just one stuck in the 1920s unfit for todays audiences king king is also very slow and thus very long though never becoming selfindulgent     flawed but fun      64100
Sep 14 2021,positive,other than the original by far the best of the kong movies
Sep 10 2021,positive,modern classics of adventure cinema the pros outweigh the cons the action is impressive and in the foreground here are the characters who are the real kings of the frame even though some of them are not real
Sep 6 2021,positive,great movie the best kong movie ever
Sep 6 2021,positive,a film that enhances the original in every way and its impossible to finish the film without a tear in the eye the only problem is it drags a lot 7510
Aug 30 2021,negative,stick to the original  or even the jessica lange 1970s remake this one was just a sad attempt to showcase jacksons newfound bravado ego and his hey look what i can do narcissism fails on every level just because you scored a hit with the technology to pull off lotr doesnt mean itll work with every other thing you touch 
Aug 20 2021,positive,the question on the lips of many after the lord of the rings the return of the king reached its 457th ending and actually followed through with it was what on earth does peter jackson do next i jest about the the running time of tlotrrotk but in reality i wouldnt  have it a second shorter even in its extended version the trilogy changed the face of cinema and jackson soon announced his next project would be another remake of king kong and it would breach the 3 hour barrier as is jacksons wont seeing this in a battered old cinema in a small town in wicklow ireland at christmas in 2005 where the heating failed during the intermission i completely fell in love with king kong watching 15 years on i was staggered at how good it still looks the visuals are absolutely remarkable jacksons storytelling thrust amongst a dazzling world he creates before your very eyes transports you to a place where you really believe in the characters and dont look at your watch once hell i forgot i was wearing one im sure another remake wont be to everyones taste but i had to flag this up because i was blown away at how much i loved this and how impressive it was on 3rd viewing
Jul 30 2021,positive,movie rating 7510
Jul 21 2021,negative,to me this movie is a waste of time 3 hours long it can get a bit boring i dont like it
Jul 8 2021,positive,its good but way too long  the story is pretty simple which is fine but there is just tons of action sequences with no meaningful dialog that could have been shortened or eliminated
Jun 28 2021,positive,great film a little overlong
Jun 27 2021,negative,let us get realistic here have you ever smelled feces like are on king kong  is blowing dry a good sensuous thing when your breath smells bad  too much reality was removed from this movie
May 17 2021,positive,king kong  1010 peter jackson was riding high from the massive success of the lord of the rings trilogy with the return of the king earning a record tying 11 academy awards with all that success jackson earned carte blanche status given the ability to finally go ahead with his passion project a remake of king kong been in development since the 90s jackson had been trying for years to get the project up and running only to finally have the power to do so the film ended up in theaters for christmas 2005 with it earning decent box office returns and high acclaim but it didnt end up achieving lotr type success which has sadly caused this movie to be underrated with time passing by however the film has achieved a fairly good cult following and in comparison to the uninspired kong skull island many fans have had a reignited love for this adaptation kong saw some fairly unique casting choices which surprisingly worked naomi watts did an exceptional job as the lead character jack black really surprises as the moneyfame driven director and andy serkis works his magic as the motion capture stand in for the beast what jackson does so amazingly well in this film is his eye for visuals and method of story telling the run time of 3 hours flies by when watching the movie it such a fun film and one that goes at a perfect pace the journey to skull island the action set pieces on the island the incredible reimagined nyc sequences towards the fatale end give this film such an amazing viewing experience its one of those rare instances where the remake might be better than the original its blasphemous to say since the original kong is a classic but theres a lot of heart and soul in this film we see jackson deliver so much in all fronts that it feels extremely personal even when you consider that the film when boiled down is just a monster movie it was one of my favourite films growing up and im glad its starting to gain more respect and praise over the years its probably one of the last solo epics we will ever see considering that many films nowadays are designed to have sequels
May 16 2021,negative,i only like that the movie is set the year king was created kong fighting and the scene where he laughs at the girl
May 8 2021,neutral,king kong was a very dark turn of the monster sure i loved everything about kong but the story was mixed the characters were written poorly it was not a good king kong film the only thing i liked about the movie was kong himself and the soundtrack i am going to give king kong a d
May 5 2021,positive,one of the best remakes ever compared to the newest kong films this has ten times the adventure creatures story and emotional effect only two directors could have made a film this big and intricate  peter jackson or james cameron and im glad jackson did it because it has that weirdness hes famous for the way he sets up new york city 1933 is really well done and like cameron its hard to tell whats a miniature cgi or practical when theyve all been blended into each shot so well the film is pretty brutal too if there was blood this would have been r rated
Apr 25 2021,positive,king kong drags endlessly through its first hour but kicks into high gear with a good story solid acting amazing motion capture and a worthy remake of the 1933 classic
Apr 21 2021,positive,this movie is what all monster movies should be the music the cgi the story and the characters are absolutely amazing the soundtrack is one of the best ive ever heard in my life it takes them awhile to get to skull island but once they arrive the movie gets epic peter jackson done an amazing job on this movie i love this film and have watched it over 20 times and im still at the edge of my seat everytime the story of this film is perfect this movie never fails to make me cry during the ending this movie is absolutely amazing i would recommend to anyone
Apr 16 2021,positive,one word  great  run time can be shortened  else everything was fine and amazing
Apr 6 2021,positive,this serves as the dawn of the romantic action monster and human formula but not as worth to grip it all for over three hours even if they expanded it to an ultimate high budgeted fantasy
Apr 5 2021,positive,peter jacksons version was glorious and breathtaking at times but coming off of his masterful handling of the lord of the rings trilogy he also made some key mistakes that might have made this an alltime classic casting jack black  adrien brody just felt like misfires and his penchant for the slowmotion sequence with emotional music was overplayed a little more editing might have served the film better to keep it well under the three hour mark it stands at still this stands as a fantastic version of this classic film
Apr 4 2021,positive,the world and story feel genuine withouth facial expression peter succeeded to create the love story this is a must see in my opinion
Apr 4 2021,positive,the 1st hour of the movie is horriblei actually walked out of the theateri think that is the only time i ever did thatzero stars for the 1st hourso skip to where the boat first approaches the island approx 1 hrs inand go from therefrom that point the movie is 5 starsthe best giant monster movie ever for the last 2 hours
Apr 2 2021,positive,amazing spectacle of sight sceneary and sounds yet just as skull island had to be search out i had to search for a reason to care about any of the people in this film aside from the gigantic cgi title character and for three hours thats a shortfall or long fall
Apr 2 2021,positive,the film takes a while to get going but when it does it is a blast
Apr 1 2021,positive,outside of a few scenes that dont work peter jacksons king kong is thrilling emotional and a good homage to the 1933 original
Mar 31 2021,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a very well made remake of a classic monster movie that surprisingly offers many improvements over its predecessor with only very few sacrifices made in the process
Mar 30 2021,negative,their was no monkey for 2 hours this was the worst movie i have ever seen
Mar 30 2021,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a respectable but tiresome remake this director has the tendency to overblow every single scene beyond any reasonable proportions which is exactly what happened in this threehour long movie filled with extremely prolonged endless scene after scene the movie is quite adventurous at times some of the monster fights on the island are super cool and the vfx were groundbreaking for this time and they still look great the highlight is the central beastwoman relationship that is actually better here than it was in the original thanks to wonderful work from andy serkis and naomi watts the film is wellintentioned and frequently quite charming but its excessive runtime was its ultimate doom
Mar 26 2021,positive,one of the best beauty and the beast like love stories ever put to film
Mar 26 2021,negative,some classics should be left untouched same with this movie despite the famous and talented cast the movie and script were so bad one of the worst movies ive seen in a while its also trying too hard to be fun and entertaining not for me
Mar 20 2021,positive,too long and not too good the first hour is quite interesting but as it goes further you get bored
Feb 27 2021,positive,one of the best remakes ever peter jackson put alot of love into this careful not to muddy the reputation of the original while also creating a new gritty vision that bug pit scene
Feb 19 2021,neutral,while peter jacksons remake of king kong has its merits it ultimately fails due to its ponderous length  on the bright side the cinematography is often stunning most of the special effects especially involving kong are remarkable the acting is surprisingly good throughout and naomi watts can let loose a scream thats on par with fay wray  unfortunately the first hour is sluggish at best and once the intrepid crew arrive on skull island the action sequences drag on for longer than necessary making them more exhausting than exciting  even the climactic empire state building scene rambles on for almost twenty minutes as kong winces with every bullet wound while endlessly swinging at the oncoming planesenough alreadyplease
Feb 18 2021,positive,extremely underrated
Feb 15 2021,positive,tough movie to rate on the one hand the special effects are awesome and won oscars on the other hand they went on and on  like you were watching a 3 hour video game watt is wonderful as darrow however cgi kong is the best male actor in the film 1976 remake is still by far my favorite
Jan 21 2021,positive,surprisingly good   i was not expecting much from this but it was actually pretty great yes it starts a bit slow but after the beast appears its an enjoyable ride until the end with good acting great cgi and a nice score    also i would recommend the making of videos production diaries too deleted scenes show the backstory of some characters that was not shown even in the extended cut
Jan 12 2021,positive,peter jacksons remake of king kong is shockingly better than the original with groundbreaking special effects great actors and somehow a far more interesting story albeit a much longer one i actually found myself enjoying it more than the 1933 classic
Jan 1 2021,positive,one of my all time favorites
Dec 30 2020,positive,a real work of art which even after 12 years brought me to tears and caused incredible emotions peter jackson is a great director and king kong is one of his best works the film that i love madly from the very first viewing in early childhood to today a real masterpiece
Dec 27 2020,positive,a very awesome remake that may be too long but has great acting awesome production design amazing visuals and effects and a brilliant new and improved kong
Dec 24 2020,positive,this movie gets way more crap for dragging out screentime than it deserves i was never bored while watching it
Dec 15 2020,positive,great special effects and a story with emotional depth although it must be said that some of the actors do a more convincing job than others
Dec 15 2020,positive,watch again  nothing compares to the special effects and spectacle on show here
Dec 15 2020,positive,far better that the original king kong that was a sequel the was beautiful told in a 3 hour and 10 minute opus magnus of petter jackson hits
Dec 2 2020,positive,extremely entertaining thrilling action packed and way better than the original
Nov 20 2020,positive,a monumental success of a movie  if it had been announced that a remake of the classic king kong was being made without the name peter jackson attached to it there is no doubt audiences would have been outraged but after the enormous success of the lord of the rings trilogy it would seem that the general public has learned to trust director peter jackson after watching his remake of king kong i would have to say that their trust was well placed    jackson now firmly cements his name as a master filmmaker the kind that all aspiring directors want to be the attention he pays to the most minute details the sheer class he shows in terms of production and scale the amount of skill he has in manipulating our fragile emotions the man is clearly one of the most talented directors in film history and jackson certainly brings his considerable skill and flair to show here in kong while a different director likely would have sped up the story to the crews arrival on skull island jackson takes his time with a nice leisurely build up to their arrival giving us lots of time to really get to know these characters and also providing time for a slow and genuine romance building between the characters of anne and jack this romance does lead to the very few and seldom weaknesses of the film the romance scenes can seem a bit cheesy and contrived at times but when thats literally the only complain i can make its a pretty damn good sign for the movie    the visual effects are an essential part of the movie and they really needed to be done well here to properly sell the idea  safe to say that they were still good enough to surpass my already unrealistically high expectations safe to say even in todays computer saturated film industry the special effects in king kong will still succeed in blowing you away and jackson seems to have an almost uncanny skill in manipulating his audiences emotions  you will cheer you will laugh you will cry you will really be on the edge of your seat and you will be truly and thoroughly disgusted in at least one part of the movie  watch out for a cave full of giant insects on skull island it seemed only fair to post a warning considering how profoundly well done it is    the cast is pitch perfect right down to the most minuscule parts the natives on skull island are even more terrifying than any orcs or evil creatures in lotr naomi watts gives a heartwarming and wonderful performance as the innocent ann darrow the beauty who killed the beast and indeed performance aside watts hasnt looked this beautiful for quite a while while everyone had their doubts about jack blacks casting a while back he proves to be just what his character needed to be truly believable black harnesses his trademark manic energy and instead of playing it for laughs expels it through carl denhams passion for the film industry and his lust for providing a show for his audiences  sometimes at the cost of his morals i must admit i have never been a fan of adrien brody but even he managed to win my sympathies and proves surprisingly convincing as heroic screenwriter jack driscoll and then theres andy serkis the man is so underrated since his best performances have been overshadowed by masks of admittably impressive cgi but result in him losing credit he so desperately deserves serkis while utterly convincing as an enormous silverback gorilla in terms of movement and vocalizations still manages to bring a surprising humanity to kong im hard pressed to remember the last time an animal protagonist has managed to capture our hearts and emotional involvement as much as kong does and serkis definitely deserves accolades for recreating such an iconic character in a beautiful fashion only through movement and body language he also takes a hilarious supporting role as the grizzled and triggerhappy lumpy the cook    overall i think it is safe to say that king kong succeeds on a level completely lost to most productions these days rarely are our emotions manipulated with such ease rarely do we find ourselves getting so engrossed in a story that a 3 hour running time seems to have gone by far too quickly and we yearn for more king kong is an odyssey of a movie and the most genuine and compelling output seen since well the lord of the rings this is classic storytelling at its peak  dont miss out on it    1010
Nov 18 2020,positive,i have absolutely zero idea why anyone would give this a poor rating the special effects and performances are on key this is the best kk movie
Nov 11 2020,positive,i dont think king kong deserves the negative reviews its gotten from audience feedback but that isnt to say that the movie is flawless and doesnt suffer from shortcomings    the animated and special effects in the movie are really topnotch it actually looks like a real gigantic zoogorilla on steroids duking it out with 1920s biplanes and the setting is true to the depicted time period to a dot its always fascinating to jump a century back in time and see what our current homelands looked like a generation or two ago    im usually not a fan of remasters and reboots but the original plot of kong was competently adapted and the personal additions and changes made to this newer version were all pretty sensical and stylistically appealing    the faults with king kong are some heavy spoonfuls of moviecheese and honestly the odd attachment between the girl and the monkey like lady i dunno but the hairy killingmachine just iced a bunch of your friends why are you still being affectionate with it that didnt add a lot of entertainment or make much sense i came here for a monsterflick you can keep your soap
Oct 24 2020,positive,great movie with a flawed but fun plot and characters are rather fun with cool monster fight scene 
Oct 12 2020,positive,didnt like this movie i got half way through this movie and gave up i love king kong but not this movie
Sep 22 2020,positive,its good but some movies dont need to be over 3 hours this one is like buying a really good piece of meat and then seasoning the hell out of it to the point its just way overdone and begins to diminish the taste there was so much more than there needed to be it actually stayed close to the story of the 1933 version though almost twice as long and there were a ton of details included from that version this one focused a lot more on the human characters i was never really bored but i was also doing other things while watching it it was a fun ride but too long
Sep 10 2020,positive,well done edge of your seat with action man intent on making a movie heads to the lost skull island and finds a huge gorilla in a land of dinosaurs 
Aug 22 2020,positive,what a marvelous movie it has pretty good characters and production design but most importantly it has great cgi and gets the audience to emphasize with kong
Aug 19 2020,positive,this is the best king kong movie of all the acting including kong himself is excellent i especially enjoyed the brave watts and brody characters and their performances great dinos too they rival jurrasic park its a classy thrilling edge of your seat adventure and love story  and its not too long because its entertaining throughout more movies should be this well done
Aug 16 2020,positive,an entertaining adventure epic with some glaring issues    peter jacksons monster horror adventure king kong 2005 is a striking reimaging of the old 1933 classic horror picture of the same name jackson had just finished directing the lord of the rings trilogy of fantasy films so i guess he wanted to make one more massive epic for audiences to enjoy the problem is he crammed so many ideas into 3 hours that you get disengaged after awhile and king kong certainly feels the length did this need to be 187 minutes for this story honestly no and jamie selkirk had to cut a lot im sure but what we got was just too much to sit through for how uninteresting the drama is with scarce action    jacksons direction is ambitious in scale and scope with a clear vision but it gets muddled by bad jokes corny melodramatic dialogue racist tropes and the same story that we already know regardless of some changes here peter jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens script is intriguing yet bare bones in character development as everything serves to develop kongs character which leaves all the humans as one note caricatures    andrew lesnies cinematography has many beautiful shots especially all of his closeup shots on naomi watts who is incredible here as ann darrow her sympathetic role is full of teary eyed looks and blood curdling screams the cgi for kong is excellent with many realistic shots that may trick you into thinking the giant lovable gorilla is real however some of the green screen backgrounds look super fake and are distracting upon revisiting king kong    grant majors production design is lavish with period accurate sets all over king kong james newton howards score is chilling and exciting as he delivers an understated score for peter jacksons frightening scenes jacksons erratic direction does feature his signature slow down shots with the camera phasing in and out as well as his ultra wide shots that are quite stunning i like terry ryan carolyn m fenton and simon wards costumes too    jack black steals the show as the villainous director carl denham his display of obsession and greed are captivating much like naomi watts lovely performance as a portrayal of empathy adrien brody is gripping as the genuine playwright jack driscoll andy serkis is fun as the cook but deeply touching as kong himself his motion capture performances are legendary for a reason jamie bell and kyle chandler are really authentic as well in their subtle roles colin hanks is just alright as preston although he gets the point across about jack blacks exponentially corruptive presence and actions    in all peter jackson did his best with this mighty movie but there are strange tonal shifts from human sacrifice to kong skating on ice
Jul 23 2020,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Jul 16 2020,positive,this is what i call a film  this film is one of the best remakes of all time a true masterpiece
Jun 30 2020,positive,i have a lot of fun with this movie from them being attacked by bugs to kong fighting the dinosaurs to even the end when kong was looking for ann and hed just toss aside the girl if it wasnt ann character but they kinda imply or hint at kong and ann being into each other which i find really creepy and unnecessary and the movie is 3 hours long but i was entertained with this movie but its just way too long
Jun 27 2020,negative,i dont know how he did it but peter jackson made king kong boring i actually fell asleep near the end
Jun 24 2020,negative,i fell asleep in the cinema for an hour in the middle of a generic cgi fight and felt like i missed nothing at the end a postmovie review with my friends confirmed this was the case
Jun 11 2020,neutral,just like the third lord of the rings movie peter jackson had no one saying no and he gets self indulgent for a portion of the movie 20 minutes too long starts really well and just steadily goes downhill
May 22 2020,positive,truly a solid movie with a great director of peter jackson i couldnt ask for anything good visual effects cinematography story list goes on
May 20 2020,positive,its effects are very good but i confess i slept in the middle of the film
May 16 2020,positive,not as great as the original but i still love jacksons take on this classic movie the actors and effects are amazing sad i think the movie is just a little too long
Apr 23 2020,positive,it is too long and focuses more on the development of the human characters than the titular ape but it still a decent movie with impressive visual effects and great casting which serves as an affectionate homage to the 1933 original
Apr 20 2020,positive,great movie awesome characters and plot
Apr 12 2020,neutral,the appreciation for the original story is obvious when it comes to the casting and special effects sadly the plot is drawn out the pacing is slow and you can pass the time with something better than this
Mar 24 2020,positive,this movie way way way to long i also didnt like how sad the tone was and when it wasnt sad it was disturbing with the bugs however king kong is amazing and they do a great job of making him a sympathetic character finally this has the best monster fight ive ever seen 
Mar 22 2020,positive,this was really good surprisingly jack black was in it the movie did really good with special effects and all king kong looked great i feel like this remake was better than the first remake it is worth the watch
Mar 16 2020,positive,one of the best remakes ever almost a masterpiece
Mar 8 2020,positive,probably the deepest storywise monster movie ever made great indepth depiction of new york city in the 20s coupled with beautiful cinematic views of skull island nice parallels between kongs final days on skull island and in nyc terrific emotional performance by naomi watts
Mar 2 2020,positive,oh boy thats a good one
Mar 1 2020,positive,excellent movie has heart action and good acting one of the best movies of 2005 much much better cgi than any of the jurassic park movies naomi scott is great people complaining about the movie being too long would have a point if the graphics were cheesy it is not in my opinion they are commenting with bad faith its not just people screaming and running from monsters each interaction is fleshed out between the participants  just read roger eberts review it says it all wholeheartedly agree with him
Feb 24 2020,positive,the fact this has a 50 audience score just goes to show you how dumbed down the general movie going audience has become these same people who hate this movie mind you are the same ones who love the fast and the furious and think every marvel movie is a cinematic masterpiece imagine hating a movie because its too long you simpletons should really stick to watching vin diesel movies and should seriously stop thinking your opinion matters youre an idiot and to that one guy who claims it has horrible cgi you should seriously go jump off a 20 story building what a complete moron you are
Feb 6 2020,positive,incredible magnificent tenderness captivating a beautiful work by peter jackson
Feb 5 2020,positive,i honestly dont see why audiences hate this film so much
Jan 30 2020,positive,modern take on the classic with a great cast and spectacular visual fx many have argued with the running length and yes perhaps some could of been edited out but overall director peter jackson takes you on a wild ride
Jan 22 2020,positive,peter jackson shows fanboylike admiration for the original king kong in this bloated but very well made remake  theres a lot of care and heart put into this version even if some of the action sequences go way overboard and the plot is extremely drawn out
Jan 9 2020,positive,despite being a whoppin 3 hours and 21 minutes i liked this movie the only thing i hated from this one is that its script was written so i could be a vast change from the iconic 1933 movie hot take it did not need to be three hours not to mention its longer than avengers endgame its not flawless at all there are many flaws to it like slow pacing the unnessecary addins to make the movie its length and in contrast to the 1933 movie but unlike the godawful disney remakes king kong 2005 lives up to the og kong go watch it its almost worth 3 hours
Jan 5 2020,positive,love it ive probably seen this movie about 25 times lol maybe ill watch it right now lol
Dec 16 2019,positive,this was an odd viewing experience in that the special effects were obviously perfectly done and stateoftheart as you would expect from the largest movie budget of its time and the acting was thoroughly spoton but there was this unshakeable feeling that the movie sorely lact subtlety all of the characterization plot points action scenes and dialogue seemed onedimensional inyourface and unsurprising no matter how well they were executed it was like there was no deep level of thought put into the screenplay  even the excessive jostling of naomi in the majority of her interactions with kong seemed meant to be taken as fact despite what shouldve been obvious severe whiplash they seemed to substitute a few bizarre segments of surrealslowmotion cinematography that never made sense in exchange for any real soul the effects that made kong realistic were the highlight of the movie followed closely by the excellent film score
Dec 16 2019,positive,this movie was just heartwarming and a great revision to a classic the soundtrack was wonderful the characters were great the movie was great
Dec 15 2019,positive,it may be long but its entertaining its intense its emotional and memorable
Dec 5 2019,positive,awesome movie of 2005
Nov 3 2019,positive,i liked a lot actually
Oct 31 2019,positive,i have no idea why people gave this movie bad reviews maybe because it was too long ok but i still loved every second of it
Oct 27 2019,positive,i loved king kong sure yes some of the scriptwriting was pretty bad and some of the camera work sucked as well but apart from that king kong was great 
Sep 18 2019,positive,powerful performances great special effects great action great story and outstanding direction by peter jackson king kong is not only the best king kong movie but one of the best films ever made its an absolute most see incredible and beautiful pice of art    my rating
Sep 17 2019,positive,only a 50 audience score geez this movie is fantastic yes it is long but there are many 3hour movies that are amazing oh hi endgame sup lord of the rings how you doing godfather its beautiful exciting emotionally resonant has great performances awesome music and really clever humor peter jackson did good
Sep 9 2019,positive,peter jackson accomplishes his lifelong passion of remaking his favorite film most of this film is completely amazing as the love just pours thought the project  wetas effects look better in this film than they ever have aside from a few scenes    the only thing about this movie that is daunting for some people is the length bcuz at times it drags  i am okay with that as much of the film is extremely comfortably filmed something that has become a trademark of jacksons films
Sep 1 2019,negative,jacksons main cinematic artifice is put to characters in peril in high places which he does here to tiresome excess working with big franchises only serves to highlight his woeful inadequacies as a director who once again smothers the sum of his poor decisions in studio lighting or dead desaturated hues this overwrought monstrosity makes you yearn for the charm and blackandwhite of the original 
Aug 20 2019,positive,i love peter jacksons films and i honestly cant say how many times ive watched this its got a brilliant cast its full of exciting actionpacked scenes the effects for kong are great and even though it may be cheesy at times i think it just makes it all the more enjoyable it may be a long wait until we get to the island but to be perfectly honest i was more than happy to wait
Aug 18 2019,positive,the acting is good but this movie is absurdly long i disliked the entire first hour and the last 10 minutes but at the very end someone i watched it with cried so thats something i guess king kong fighting anything is entertaining the cgi is really fake and seems to float on the top layer overall i would recomend just skip the first hour
Aug 5 2019,positive,its a fun descendant of the 1933 classic 
Jul 28 2019,negative,i could personally cut 45 minutes from this ridiculous movie and make it 10 times better the giant insect or whatever beast battle and the ice skating scenes were just unnecessary peter jackson really needs a good editor even while cutting those scenes would make the movie watchable king being such a wuss in the end was an affront to the original
Jul 14 2019,positive,i thought it was a great remake of the original king kong looked and acted more like a gorilla then skull island he looked like bigfoot and i think he was the perfect size in skull island he was too huge to do anything skull island wasnt bad but i think this was better 
Jul 14 2019,positive,this movie was great i absolutely loved it i definitely recommend it and this deserves a b
Jul 12 2019,positive,wow most of the critics were on the right track and the viewers screwed it up phenomenal movie 
Jun 25 2019,positive,great movie  makes my childhood awesome
May 28 2019,positive,i thought that the first hour of the film could be tuched up a little but it give a good character foundation whilst the rest of the movie is action packed with beautifully crafted cgi and motion capture animation
May 25 2019,positive,probably my favorite movie ever amazing visuals acting music and king kong is just a spectacle
May 16 2019,positive,this movie was very entertaining for the most part the beginning scenes are kind of bored but once the story gets going the movie gets much more enjoyable
May 7 2019,positive,a remake of a classic movie that is worthy to be compared with the original and adds its own magic with a capable cast topofthe art effects and some nice new touches to the famous story
May 1 2019,positive,this movie truly lives up to ones expectations phenomenal work by peter jackson
Apr 8 2019,positive,with great spectacle and effects this movie keeps the essence of the original while making it much grander and epic though it is quite overlong and seems to bite off more than it can chew with its wide variety of characters the movie stays strong and entertaining till the end
Apr 3 2019,negative,ridiculous story and horrible cgi
Mar 26 2019,positive,this looks exactly like the original 1933 one but with color
Mar 25 2019,positive,i understand why people dont like this movie but personally whatever the reason i enjoyed it and thats all
Mar 8 2019,positive,naomi watts really gives an amazing performance in this film
Feb 22 2019,positive,its length may be too much for some but i adored jackson take on king kong the characters are wonderful the special effects are great and the humanity of the story has not been lost as is the case with most hollywood remakes
Feb 17 2019,negative,nice visually but scenes drag on leading to very few story elements taking place over long periods of time
Feb 7 2019,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a film that shall be referred to as a masterpiece in a decade or so this is film magic of the highest order jacksons version is unarguably the finest there is and one of the most difficult things about king kong may be picking a favorite scene especially since the final two hours are packed with candidates actionadventure lovers have the dinorampage featuring raptors chasing down a pack of brontosaurs the triple trex smackdown a tour de force that lasts about 10 minutes an insect attack that will make bugphobes squirm indiana jones and the temple of doom is tame by comparison kongs attempts to reclaim his stolen bride and the final empire state building battle for me the quiet moments are in many ways more rewarding kong and ann bonding while watching a sunset and the playfulness of central park the latter is more rewarding with tragedy looming so close
Feb 3 2019,positive,with the benefit of a century of technological progress bolstering it this may easily be the most entertaining and best looking version of kong but despite the overly long runtime something about jacksons version just feels diminished compared to the original maybe its the fact that kong for the first time looks like a real gorilla rather than the more fantastic and mythical creature of the previous films or maybe its that a lot here amounts to a shotforshot beatforbeat remake which makes too much of the threehour slog feel uninspired unnecessary and as repetitive as distant island drumming a decadeandahalf after its release the special effects may have dimmed somewhat and dont feel half as revolutionary as the rudimentary techniques of the 1933 original which leaves me wishing that the filmmakers had spent a little more on hiring an editor rather than just one more animator
Jan 8 2019,positive,ok heres my rating  entertainment  70  atmosphere  82  plot  78  acting  92  cgi  76  sad scenes  i dont add this when there is no sad scenes in movies  62  fight scenes  91 if there are fight scenes  in my opinion this movie is actually pretty good its just that they need to feature king kong more in the movie the sad scenes almost made me cry i didnt rate it 70 and up because the sad scenes didnt make me cry i almost cried but i didnt soyeah the fight scenes and the acting was great but i focus more on entertainment overall this movie is nice thou for me it doesnt deserve a 5 or a full 4
Jan 3 2019,positive,still love this movie 
Dec 31 2018,positive,portions of peter jacksons 3hour tribute to the original king kong and the era in which it was made hold up while other parts of it simply dont it has a brilliant sense of vision adventure and plenty of scenes of excitement but it also bears the burden of moments of overstylization and outdated special effects
Dec 30 2018,positive,loooooooooooooooooong  good movie but way longer then it shouldve been it also requires some thinking but it does keep you on the edge of your seat the movie goes like this  hour one intro and on the boat  hour two jungle  hour three jungle and new york  to be honest its kind of hard to hold your attention
Dec 19 2018,positive,bold beautiful epic and with a sweeping majesty peter jackson successfully and faithfully updates the 1933 b movie classic into a a fantasy epic it features naturally dazzling visuals that breath not just life but real soul into its main primate as well as its majestic locations of skull island and 1930s new york but also well rounded fleshed out characters a grand sense of adventure and love of film and a believable and heart felt love story between beauty and the beast     both new york and skull island locations are teeming with life and intricacy and nuance skull island has a full eco system and is a character unto itself the period detailing in new york is staggering youll forget or completely miss that its all on a soundstage the action sequences are beautifully coherent and filled with eye candy peter jackson continuously uping the ante his love for the original showing in every frame which pops with lavishly saturated primary hues for a beautifully filmic look topped with an exhilarating romantic score and a leading lady who gets more to do than just scream ann darrows emotional investment is what helps us invest emotionally in the finale fleshing out the character into a leading lady we can care about while each of the other characters get their own time to shine and convince us of each of their own motivations     then we get to kong himself finally andy serkis mocap performance and wetas digitial artistry combined have rendered our first living breathing kong even 12 years on he still looks impressive and convincing in a range of emotions to be sure its a long film and the extended edition a very long film but its time well spent one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences to date and the only time ive come away from a 3hr film craving more not less this is how you make an epic
Dec 18 2018,positive,king kong darely revises the classic character in a high stakes thrill ride with action humor and thrills
Dec 18 2018,positive,this movie proved that you cant recreate to magic of the originals but it sure did try its hardest it does take a really long time for them to get on the island but if you make it that far then it will get better from there
Dec 15 2018,positive,it may be too long and quite slow in the beginning but this is a movie made with passion and love for the storycharacters and it shows in every breathtaking frame
Dec 11 2018,negative,horribly paced overly long incredibly overrated and extremely boring peter jacksons king kong remake is a slow horribly paced and incredibly boring film with an insanely long runtime that overstays its welcome the runtime is insanely overly long this movie is too long it takes forever for an action scene to happen and takes forever for king kong to show up it took like an hour and a half for the human characters to show up to skull island the forced romance between king kong and naomi watts character was weird annoying completely unnecessary and dragged on for too long why did peter jackson make king kong a giant gorilla instead of a giant sasquatch like he was in the original the cgi for king kong even looks pretty dated and hasnt aged that well all of the human characters were boring forgettable unlikable and uninteresting the ending was so horrible the ending really sucked i absolutely hated the ending i once even fell asleep during the movie cause it was so damn boring i dont know why a lot of people like this movie highly overrated film i did not like it and i still do not like it the saddest thing isthat this was the first king kong movie i ever watched and i never knew there were any other king kong movies before it i used to think this was the original one i was only 9 years old when i first watched this film i hated it back then and i still hate it to this day thank god for the 2017 reboot i am so thankful that jordan vogtroberts and legendary pictures redeemed king kong 12 years later    rating 410
Nov 2 2018,positive,great visuals and cast but the runtime could be shorter
Oct 28 2018,negative,i should know by now  i cant relate to a film where a key protagonist is not human
Oct 22 2018,positive,with updated special effects a heartfelt story and lovable characters king kong is a rare gem when it comes to remakes
Oct 13 2018,positive,epic in size as only peter jackson can do king kong is a fantastic retelling of the classic film
Oct 12 2018,negative,obviously the only reason most of the main characters were chosen for this movie is because they could scream their head off or look handsome for long periods of time
Sep 20 2018,positive,it was just an alright movie kind of slow at some parts but the visual effects help me conclude it to be 68
Jul 24 2018,positive,king kong is a fantastic film i was blown away even though i went in with high expectations this is a tour de force work behind the camera by peter jackson who directs the monster epic and adds his own touches there is action suspense drama and most importantly heart wrenching romance i dare anyone to not have a tear in their eye in the last 20 minutes the special effects are absolutely amazing and more importantly never do they detract from the progression of the story i was blown away by the trex vs kong battle the dino stampede and some of the earlier rather creepy scenes but it is the scenes between ann darrow and kong that touch you the most and a particular one in central park in the snow is a highlight this is a must watch a surefire classic of the future but beware at roughly 3 hours its long but each minute is artistic perfectionthe best kong version ever
Jul 21 2018,neutral,great pictures and effects
Jul 20 2018,positive,wow thats so cool
Jul 15 2018,negative,stunningly portrayed fantastic acting and reeking of a potent of nostalgia
Jul 10 2018,negative,what a sad waste of film and time when peter jackson could have so much better
Jun 26 2018,negative,very too drama and very awkward in this film however i like how they made king kong more stronger 
Jun 18 2018,positive,literally the only bad thing with this movie is the cgi
Jun 6 2018,negative,this is a really really bad movie  the tone is uncertain at first its an adventure movie for child and i dont mean indiana jones i mean indiana jones junior peter jackson applies the monomyth structure to naomi watts character with a complete lack of finesse for example the crossing the threshold step naomi watts litterally crosses the threshold between the dock and the boat this is quite embarassing  and then a guy dies in a lord of the ring fashion way too serious compared to the introduction of the movie  the introduction is too long and full of feel good movies clichés then it becomes a violent movie out of nowhere it is full of little details that annoyed me a lot how can naomi watts neck can survive 20g acceleration in the hand of king kong  etc etc
Jun 4 2018,positive,unlike the sour audience score peter jacksons remake of the legendary classic isnt bad by any means as a matter of fact it is actually better than the original in one very important way it provides kong with enough screentime and character moments alongside ann darrow to make his death seem tragic and overly sorrowfull in an almost shakesperian manner  then again however unfortunate it may seem the film is ultimately overwhelmed by its  grandiose and awe inspiring spectacle which is all topped off with an abundance of long   action scenes that just make something about the film not sit right in your stomach my bad its your head that i am trying to talk about    my grade for the film a solid b at the least
May 25 2018,negative,king kong was to long a movie to watch and not that great of a movie kong skull island is better
May 5 2018,positive,this movie is an absolute perfect remake of the 1933 original peter jackson really brings the island and kong to life absolute superb remake that not only catches the spirit of the original but also breaks new ground naomi watts deserved an oscar for her portrayal as anne darrow she and kong had great chemistry and throughout the movie she did a great job of making the audience feel what she was feeling i honestly thought this was an academy award worth film with state of the art  cgi which holds up still in 2019     so many times we see film makers take liberties with characters that they know nothing about such as the russo brothers with the hulk but not peter jackson he is a true artist and really did the character and the film right thank you to you mr jackson for really doing a great job with this film
May 5 2018,positive,a surprisingly good remake king kong succeeds in many areas
Apr 20 2018,negative,critics please stop snorting the cocaine and kissing peoples ascot no way is this movie worth more than one star 1976 king kong with jeff bridges was one hundred times better than this mess this one should have never been made smh
Mar 31 2018,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a triumph with both stunning visual effects and amazing performances especially from andy serkis as  kong serkiss role in kong isnt that looked upon as gollum or caesar kong is one of his most emotional performances ever

Jan 7 2018,positive,amazing movie but just as racist as i remember maybe he was trying to capture the racism of the time probably not
Dec 22 2017,positive,to begin with i am a big king kong fan from the time i was a kid i truly enjoyed this updated version  this version has catapulted to the front of my favorite all time films list peter jackson did a remarkable job here  i only have one criticism aka the skating scene  besides that a
Dec 10 2017,positive,highly entertaining
Dec 5 2017,positive,always the best movies just like transformers  polished although not perfect
Dec 5 2017,positive,the trex battle alone tops all jurassic films combined including jworld yes some sketchy green screen in the stampede scene and some slow pacing in the wrong places bog it down but its still a great ride and visual feast jackson shows a true love of the source material and it shows
Oct 28 2017,positive,the story was done very well but the movie is very very long
Oct 27 2017,positive,best king kong remake but a little to long to get to the island
Sep 30 2017,positive,it was peter jacksons long term dream to be directing a king kong remake im glad that dream was turned into a masterpiece
Sep 11 2017,positive,worthy of 5 stars with the exception of drawn out scenes that jackson started doing after lotr especially the brontosaurus stampede overdone
Sep 2 2017,negative,to long of a movie not a fan of this movie
Aug 12 2017,positive,so underrated great film
Aug 12 2017,positive,in my opinion this is peter jacksons best king kong is an amazing movie with a considerably long length time which is the perfect time to include everything this movie had to offer without making it seem to fast paced or to slow everything down to the details of kongs chest hair seems to have been taken care of by the best in the movie industry especially for 2005 for now peter jacksons king kong is my all time favorite movie
Aug 10 2017,positive,the 1933 original king kong is by far my favorite movie of all time  not doubt or question about it this is a sentiment that i believe i share with peter jackson  his remake was taken on with such devotion to the original that one must appreciate his bringing the legend back to life  this isnt just a movie this is flat out worship of what i see as the greatest movie ever made king kong 1933
Aug 8 2017,positive,a 3 hour movie about a gorilla i know right while i was a bit restless when waiting to see the titular giant gorilla when he makes his first appearance the film remains an entertaining epic throughout to hell with kong skull island this is the real modern kong flick the special effects are amazing even by 2005 standards andy serkis pulls off another breathtaking motioncapture performance as the gorilla whom we nowadays consider to be harambes cousin serkis also plays a liveaction character and it helped keep me sane during the first hour of the movie since kong already appeared in the movie in a way if only human serkis and giant gorilla serkis were in the same scene together for 2 or 3 minutes itd be like seeing double i wouldve killed to see that the performances are great i dont know why people say that they find it weird to see jack black in a serious role i think he does a terrific job people love it when comedians do serious roles like adam sandler in punchdrunk love or jim carrey in the truman show naomi watts and adrien brody do great jobs of portraying ann darrow and jack driscoll respectively as well and seem to have great romantic chemistry during the first hour of this movie which is basically a drama set on a ship being sailed by fegelein if you know what i mean some of the slowmotion feels unnecessary it made me think no wonder the movies three hours long  the action sequences are amazing seeing kong fight against three trexes was one of the best action scenes i have ever seen in my entire life and given how the cgi still holds up pretty well 12 years later thats saying a lot i might have to disagree with what the audience score on this movie says they were probably just expecting another lord of the ringsbut with a 25foot gorilla never has a bond between a gorilla and a woman been so fascinating it also focuses a bit on the themes of what showbiz can do to a person because of his financial desperation carl denham resorted to animal cruelty by capturing a live kong and taking him back to americasomehow so that he can appear as part of a broadway act featuring blackface actors historical accuracy yall all i can say is that i certainly prefer this king kong movie over skull island and that it manages to deliver despite somewhat slow pacing thanks to an exhaustingly overlong runtime with andy serkis pulling off another mesmerizing performance before he turned into a sentient intelligent ape and a drunken cg scottish captain around the same time  you did good peter jackson you did good now i just need the required amount of time so that i can finally watch the lord of the rings trilogy along with that of the hobbit im a film junkie deal with it
Aug 3 2017,positive,my favorite movie of all time
Aug 1 2017,negative,bad casting acts that just drag and too much focus on effects trying to make some parts feel like deleted scenes from one of the original jurassic park films
Jul 27 2017,positive,a decent remake of peter jacksons flick
Jul 23 2017,positive,probably peter jacksons most underrated film an epic loving remake that goes into story world and character depth not even the original film delved in sure to thrill the least cynical moviegoers besides any film that makes you shed a tear for a giant ape is automatically a great movie in my book
Jul 21 2017,positive,awesome movie jack black was great
Jul 16 2017,positive,i think this is almost as good as the original
Jul 2 2017,positive,the best remake of the 21st centurys first 10 years a film made by a passionate auter who clearly has great admiration and respect for the original peter jackson has taken the original 1930s classic and chosen to expand upon the legend turning one of the greatest monster movies of all time into one of the greatest movie epics ever put to screen peter jackson has done something truly extraordinary jackson manages to give the titular giant ape monster both a heart and a soul by utilizing both the magic of motion capture technology and the talents of one of this centurys finest actors andy serkis the soulful connection that forms between him and naomi watts ann darrow is ultimately the beating heart of this movie aside from ann and kongs beautifully tragic relationship the movie is fulled by heartpounding adventure breathtaking special effects most of which still hold up over a decade later and jacksons seemingly effortless ability to create a fresh spectacle out of already groundbreaking material please check this movie out if you havent already i stand by what i said this is the single greatest movie remake of the new millenniums first decade
Jun 27 2017,neutral,for the most part the visuals are good but at times it got bad this movie was way to long and because of that i found myself getting bored     5210
Jun 27 2017,positive,record breaking director steps up to bring you his next biggest blockbuster with great cinematography and music it might not match up with the classic but it is better than other remakes in terms of plot and acting
Jun 26 2017,positive,good fx thats about it soooooo boring 
Jun 16 2017,positive,amazing film so good and great action the only flaw is its very long
Jun 15 2017,positive,with fantastic special effects and terrific designs peter jacksons love letter to monster movies is an excellent example on how to make a visual spectacle with a sense of humanity
Jun 14 2017,positive,best of the kong movie made since the first
Jun 1 2017,positive,grand and epic king kong is a stellar piece of cinema
May 30 2017,positive,while the movie is super long its hard to deny that this movie is impressive
May 26 2017,positive,50 people who comment here are absolutely retarded
May 15 2017,negative,u can split the flic in 2 parts the first half of it is really good especially the performance of the actors is really way to go  as soon as they arrive at skull island the plot kind of blacks out from then on only cgi action too bad i cannot really recommend to watch it today the cgi is not really up to date for latest standards 2017
May 12 2017,positive,55  an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions that captures the spirit of the original movie and improves upon it in many ways
May 2 2017,negative,unnecessarily long and stupid
Apr 24 2017,positive,im referring to the extended cut the first two and a half hours are a pretty great king kong movie the last 50 minutes are just unnecessary and weird especially the end

Apr 16 2017,neutral,can they make naomi watts any more helpless i mean at this point i dont even know if she could fight herself out of a wet paper bag
Apr 13 2017,positive,fantastic and epic in every way
Apr 9 2017,positive,after having just watched kong island all i could think of was how it wasnt a patch on king kong 2005 such a shame
Apr 4 2017,positive,whilst appreciated for its great style classy approach and an excellently realised kong there are one or two niggles     a couple of ridiculously over the top jungle action sequences with dinosaurs sadly take you out of the picture for a while and its probably 2030 minutes too long    still a good movie very well made
Apr 2 2017,positive,this movie is way to long its 3 hrs and 7 min and it could have easily been 2 hours at the most the first hour before they get on the island is very pointless and uneventful in my opinion but after that this movie is very good except that god awful dino stampede scene and enjoyable 
Mar 30 2017,positive,a truly epic remake from a talented director with great performances beautiful visual effects and great emotional power it is even better than the 1976 version
Mar 28 2017,positive,pretty underrated movie in my opinion it has good cgi and a pretty entertaining scenes i also think that adrian brody is a good lead and naomi watts is a good damsel in destress so in the end a pretty good remake
Mar 28 2017,positive,oh mann00bs complaining that it was too long dont understand epics
Mar 27 2017,positive,with impressive visuals and a timeless story peter jacksons king kong is heart warming and entertaining but is way too overlong and has comedic sequences added which are completely unnecessary
Mar 19 2017,negative,its like a really bad jurrasic park poor casting choice and no chemistry bad script directing and score
Mar 19 2017,positive,the action is exciting the special effects are dazzling and peter jackson definitely captured the spirit of the original 1933 film       grade a
Mar 15 2017,negative,jack black really thats who they chose the cgi is amazing but the acting was terrible one of the worst movies ever
Mar 12 2017,positive,finally a monster flix worthwhile it was full of action great storyline  comedy
Mar 11 2017,positive,the beginning of the movie was a bit of a drag but the encounters on skull island made up for that the skyscraper scene dragged on a bit too long as well but was still very emotional kong looked and acted exceptional and the bond between him and ann was executed nicely overall a good watch
Mar 11 2017,positive,fantastic film jackson brought life to this film and an emotional depth not nearly as fleshed out in its counterparts
Mar 10 2017,negative,horrible horrible movie makes me want to become a vegetarian and join peta all at the same time very sad plot the backgrounds like the sunsets on skull island look very fake and manipulated would not want to watch this movie again ever now donating to the world wildlife federation
Mar 10 2017,neutral,needs more indepth story but jacksons talent for visuals are relevant as hell
Mar 9 2017,negative,exceptional special effects and terrific performances cant  make up for the fact that the film is over long and boring a quality mr jackson has perfected with his subsequent movies
Mar 9 2017,positive,over long less is more what can i say there are parts of this film i adore kong pushing ann over and laughing is genuinely one of my favourite film moments this film also features one of my least favourite film moments the farce of the dinosaurs tripping over   such a shame   edit 45 minutes out and i sincerely believe wed have a 5 star film on our hands
Mar 8 2017,positive,when all the monsters are on screen its a blast when its some of the human characters not so much the 3 12 hr runtime doesnt help either 75100
Mar 8 2017,positive,this movie is legendary
Mar 7 2017,positive,although the cgi is dull and the 3 hours and 7 minutes 3 hours and 20 minutes with extended version are time consuming the stories drive and characters make peter jacksons king kong a great reboot
Mar 7 2017,positive,the most classic king kong movie from the greatest peter jackson just see it again before the new one comes
Mar 6 2017,positive,great remake peter jackson re live his dream childhood
Mar 5 2017,positive,this movie was great the story on skull island was amazing it brought the entire mystery of king kong to life the film is long but rewarding
Mar 5 2017,positive,its good but to stretched out and a bad story
Mar 4 2017,positive,king kong is a really good classic and this film doesnt do anything to ruin it this film respects its original material the special effects are pretty good but questionable at times but other than that everything else is really good i am willing to give this an a
Feb 26 2017,positive,moving exilerating and entertaining with andy serkis ape stealing the show  highly recommended
Feb 25 2017,positive,very fun and interesting a little long but definitely worth watching
Feb 22 2017,positive,king kong is a loyal visually stunning remake that has a great cast but unfortunately is too glamorous corny and long to be as great as it could have been
Feb 20 2017,negative,the best parts are when they get on the island and the end the rest of the movie is such a bore
Jan 12 2017,positive,the best movie that ive ever seen
Jan 3 2017,positive,great cast great acting little bit to slow at the first hr but last 2 hrs really picked for a remake not bad i give it 3 stars
Jan 1 2017,positive,excellent job of remake an iconic movie
Dec 28 2016,neutral,the movie starts out well engaging us in a delightful detailed rendition of depression era new york city  and the beginning of the ships ride in to the unknown keeps things moving  but then the ship runs in to skull island literally and peter jackson goes nuts with the special effects for a good hour  it is over the top use of computer effects that takes away any magic that had built up  by then we just want to get the damn giant ape off the damn island and get him to nyc as soon as possible so the movie can end
Nov 24 2016,negative,very disappointing  special effects overkill
Nov 22 2016,positive,peter jackson does a phenomenal albeit slightly chichã cd job at bringing kong and the monsters of skull island to the big screen reminding us of the greatness of the 1933 original
Nov 17 2016,positive,a true masterpiece of modern days everything from the effects to the performances is absolutely on point and delivers probably one the best 3 hours movies you could possibly expect
Oct 25 2016,positive,king kong 2005  87  despite its massive running time king kong makes use of an excellent cast an entertaining plot and spectacular visuals all combined with the spirit of the 1930s
Oct 17 2016,positive,nostalgic adventurous and epic this describes the very definition of the ultimate masterpiece and quite possibly my favorite film of all time
Sep 18 2016,positive,i wasnt particularly excited about this remake of kong but it wasnt terrible i think the truth lies somewhere in between
Sep 17 2016,positive,with beautiful visual effects and spectacular performances from the cast king kong is a superior film that not only remarks the glory of the original king kong but is in my opinion redeemed as one of the best movies ever made in cinematic history
Aug 28 2016,positive,there are giant bugs dinosaurs natives  giant fish and more in this epic tale
Aug 26 2016,positive,as a fan wish more entertaining from beginning
Aug 26 2016,positive,great film with amazing effects could have been a bit shorter though
Aug 18 2016,positive,there are some useless scenes in the boat but other than the 3h run time king kong is a great movie
Aug 15 2016,positive,3 hours is a little bit overboard but it was good
Aug 15 2016,positive,the greatest remake ever made watch the documentary supplements on the extended version dvd they made a movie not for the money but from the heart
Aug 11 2016,positive,best movie of all time
Aug 11 2016,positive,a drama based on the original movie yup that means no godzilla no robot king kong   because of that the movie is pretty interesting to see old movie scenes remade for modern audiences also the special effects are at really good use here also jack black does an amazing job as finally being serious for once
Aug 9 2016,positive,as good as the original   that is really saying something as the 3 hour run time had me convinced i wasnt going to like it   first the negatives  too much goddamn broll peter jackson i know you love showing us new york and the harbor in 1933 but a five second establishing shot is plenty there were countless examples of way too long shots of mostly nothing   second negative spend some cgi money on something other than kong some of the scenes on skull island specifically the running of the dinos were laughable really badly done jurassic park had better effects and predated your movie by a decade   the jack black was awful across the board i really didnt think he could be unlikable in anything boy was i wrong   finally jacks last line  the iconic one  didnt land at all because they spent so much time showing us that she loved kong she didnt kill him she tried to save him they should have found a way to make that line work and they didnt   now the good stuff  contrary to my last point i loved the extra attention on the relationship between beauty and the beast im a softie that really worked for me and kongs expressiveness was tremendous the scene on the frozen pond was pure movie magic   kong ripping through ny was simply amazing as was his fight with the trex pack    i loved all he little touches the credits with the same design putting the kong costumes from the original into the musical number in front of kong etc etc  it was very clear that jackson has a deep and abiding love for his source material   in the end the positives far outweighed the negatives i wouldnt say its better than the original but its just as good
Aug 8 2016,positive,amazing cgi effects and on most scenes made you feel you were there experiencing it
Aug 8 2016,neutral,its sorta good theres an over use of cgi the lighting at times doesnt seem to match with other shots in the same scene and the acting can be somewhat try hardish but the action is okay other than one scene and its mostly entertaining
Jul 31 2016,positive,after several decades it felt kinda odd to see one of the most iconic movie monsters receive a modern day treatment well to my surprise with peter jackson at the helm fresh off of the lord of the rings trilogy it works to a fault   the human characters were not that interesting in a film based around a giant ape and this once again proves my point the natives of the island were not only creepy but more interesting jack black and adrien brody were completely miscasted and didnt fit the time period of this film   as for the effects some looked good and others not so much it was so obvious that they were fake including that brontosaurus stampede scene you could tell that they used green screen damn but a couple scenes that i give the creators high props for is the trex fight sequence and the giant insects at the bottom of the chasm those are awesome and terrifying so the film as a whole is both hit and miss but its kinda worth a watch again and trust me when i say this this remake is a masterpiece compared to the new one kong skull island
Jul 28 2016,neutral,a movie with some great cgi plus some of the dumn ass cgis in history
Jul 27 2016,positive,i never grew up with the original 1933 king kong peter jacksons version of king kong in my opinion is the definitive version of king kong
Jul 26 2016,positive,such an epic movie a must see
Jul 25 2016,positive,although it does take forever to get to skull island the run time is not the problem there are few issues with this loyal to the original remake honestly he takes the source material modernises it maintains the canon and does it better than the 1933 film which holds up well itll take something amazing to top what peter jackson has done here
Jul 15 2016,positive,this is surprisingly a very good remake to the original source material granted it may follow the storyline to the original a little too close to make it stand out on its own but the improved visuals and its lengthy time to develop characters and share emotional moments make this film a fun ride at times id say it even manages to surpass elements of the original film itself while not perfect its still pretty darn good
Jun 24 2016,positive,this is the same old king kong movie with modern cgi effect
Jun 9 2016,positive,it is a fathful to the original and also has also updated the original story
May 30 2016,positive,undoubtedly one of my top 3 films of all times the musical score is one of the best ive heard and a prime example of how remakes should be made
May 19 2016,positive,it was the best king kong movie ever
May 3 2016,positive,very long but it has its moments 68 out of 100
Apr 5 2016,positive,in spite of the horrendous runtime i still managed to enjoy this movie peter jackson was able to deliver a very interesting film that did not have to rely on king kong being on screen the whole time this movie does have a bipolarity to it though on one hand there is some amazing special effects that would be impressive even today such as king kong himself though there were some less than glorifying special effects also such as the brontosaur stampede scene the characters had little development but were delivered as interesting still jack blacks money grabbing character is a great character to hate and executed well enough to elicit negative emotions towards overall there were spots where the movie dragged but still was able to keep me watching throughout the whole movie it is not jacksons best work but still can be commendable
Apr 5 2016,positive,king kong has some incredible action sequences but like the movie in general they can be long and drawn out this is the movies biggest flaw there are some great performances from a strong cast but even after all of this it can be slow and a little boring even 11 years on this movie looks the part and will entertain just give yourselves half a day
Apr 4 2016,neutral,not much can be said about this that hasnt already been said which is mostly bad i first and last saw it the year it hit video and i saw the last forty minutes of it again a few hours later just to confirm for myself that i had truly wasted my time now im watching it again to verify that its as horrible as i remember ill try to sell it as good as i can heres a genuinely well thoughtout attempt to bring you king kong as if it were filmed prior to 1930 but with all the advances in film techniques that were developed since then there its just not well executed included in this periodrealistic criticism is that jack black wouldnt have been born yet the worst decision was to give the most profound lines and the features most extrovert character besides kong they were written for to none other than jack black  effectively destroying any chance of the audience taking any of it seriously its not just that black is a comedian its that black has made his career on making fun of the profound by making it seem absurd if jackson was hoping to seem hip with this ironic twist of casting then what a tragic loss anything else i could write would be about secondworst thirdworst decisions forever notably horrible introspective oh wow score replete with solo angelic vocal during the gratuitous bugsmashing sequence king kong follies on ice all weekend long the hundred or so moments when the girl would have died while being carried by king kong action stopping periodically so the lead actress can do follies and juggling tricks ad infinitum some counterpoints the bugsmashing sequence seems adlibbed with the bugs being added later to almost comical effect and i think at some point jackson realized the girl was on her 90th or so life and when asking himself how does she survive all this being flung around and smashed came up with the idea that shes a follies girl hey folks she does this all week its stupid its a stupid stupid film and after writing this i dont have any further reason to go back and watch it ever again but that doesnt mean i have to give it a zero review it gets half a star for some fairly interesting computer generated imagery despite some embarassing mistakes in depth perception or do the actors sometimes seem like theyre standing in front of a movie screen on purpose to immerse us in the filmedpriorto1930 sensation half a star for some really tense moments despite an utter lack of suspense and one star for the few brief moments that it genuinely tries to look and feel like something that was filmed during the great depression im especially depressed that this was in a stack of really narrowaudience dvds including planet of the apes that my black neighbor gave me when he was moving out but half a star for having a cult following 2 12 out of 5
Apr 3 2016,positive,utterly brilliantperfect sunday afternoon viewing amazing effects backed up by a storyline true to its 1930s originalthoroughly enjoyed and never tire of watching
Apr 2 2016,neutral,planet of the apes was a much better movie
Mar 26 2016,positive,okay i totally understand why people would dislike this film it is long it has a lot of cgi good and bad the acting may be campy but for people who truly treasure the original 1933 film this movie was a dream come true at least for me it was  im a massive lover of the original stopmotion brilliantly crafted 1933 king kong i think its an absolute masterpiece and too see peter jackson clearly a fan too recreate that film with state of the art special effect to reinvigorate this story was heartwarming for me the movie is longer bigger even more interesting and i just love everything about it because i love the original soo much the movie gives you more information on each character and their backstories as expected for a movie almost double the length of the original which was great for a fan like me to get to know more about the characters ive grown to love    king kong was a total blast for me and a heartwarming experience seeing the awesome original stopmotion clay puppet fight between the trex and king kong realised and beautified with pitchperfect cgi was just one of many things i loved about king kong  the cgi of king kong was absolutely astounding obviously my compliments to andy serkis who pulls off yet another fantastic cg character performance as he also did with the lord of the rings the cgi of king kong itself was beautiful the rest of the movies cgi was severely worse especially a dinosaur stampede as the film crew has to flee out of a canyon in that scene in particular the cgi was pretty bad    of course this movie lacks the beautiful simplicity and artistery the original film had but the way pj has done it was truly incredible in my honest opinion    im sorry king kong haters im completely on the other side of the spectrum on this one
Mar 24 2016,positive,i actually really like this film yeah the first half is kinda meh but the 2nd half is very solid as well as the film including great special effects and kong looks so real overall a really good film
Mar 19 2016,negative,this film goes to show how low a good director can fall when given a budget jackson made his best films on a shoestring and its a real shame hes wasting his talent on garbage like this
Mar 14 2016,positive,had to pee in the middle of the movie
Mar 7 2016,positive,the remake of the 1933 classic is very good and special effects were great that is why the 1933 is so very special
Mar 3 2016,positive,though i like the added depth to characters the movie couldve been shortened a bit to better the pacing despite that peter jacksons king kong is an impressive and worthy remake of the 1933 classic that delivers an exciting spectacle of giant monster fights brought to life with stunning cgi and it also has a good cast and is very welldirected by jackson one of the better film remakes of the 21st century
Feb 28 2016,positive,great adventure story
Feb 13 2016,neutral,i saw this movie a long time ago and this movie was not as good as i hoped the land scape and great animals in the jungle but then it takes place in the world and king kong fights air planes in the city this movie was a little scary the movie was 3 hours long which is stupid i think i do not recommend kids watching this at all i do like mountain gorillas they are cool i think
Feb 9 2016,positive,king kong is an amazing story the movie is visually attractive and it shows solid performances of the main actors the first half of the movie is intriguing and caught the interest of the public without doubt  although it is a remake the essence of the original plot holds however it is an extremely long film and includes irrelevant scenes that can be removed without altering the story one example of this is the kongdinosaur fight nevertheless watching the film was worth it
Jan 29 2016,positive,peter jackson crafts a three hour epic in the form of king kong a film that tells its story beautifully in both a narrative and visual sense even if the latter shows signs of overindulgence
Jan 22 2016,positive,wellwritten visually stunning stirring with classic monstermovie mania and featuring one of jack blacks most amazingly againsttype performances ever this lives up to its legacy though the key emotional bond it aims for is a bit weak
Jan 20 2016,positive,a good movie remake is quite a rare thing peter jacksons king kong rehash is one of those rare occurrences spanning 3 hours long it keeps you at the edge of your seat with thrills chills and many brutal kills jack black naomi watts adrian brody and of course andy serkis as the title character are very convincing in their roles with a fun chaotic and emotional climax this film is a work of art
Jan 15 2016,positive,this is my new favorite movie king kong had tons of unexpected twists and turns the plot was amazing the acting was amazing everything about this movie was truly amazing this was also the saddest movie i have ever seen there are no words to describe how much i loved this movie 1010
Jan 9 2016,positive,peter jackson once again proves himself to be king of the epic with this visually dazzling and well paced reboot that does well to update and pay respect to the original while still maintaining its own originality    rating a
Jan 5 2016,positive,whyd king  kong have to die 09 out of 10  1 fir dead kingkong         whyd king kong have to die9 out of 10 minus1 for dead king kong
Dec 23 2015,positive,despite its 3 hour length the films visual effects andy serkiss brilliant performance and epic action makes up for it
Dec 22 2015,positive,a wonderful remake that manages to capture the feel and story of the original while updating affects design and story based details the film allows for enough changes to provide sleek originality while not divulging into any form of parody while many may find distaste at the films long run time i welcome it i actually prefer the extended edition for its superior support to the plot and the general interest held in the film that does not make it at all unbearable performances were also very well done and i was unable to pinpoint a notable weak spot in acting from any of the main cast
Dec 14 2015,positive,its exciting but does drag at times then again thats to be expected from a remake thats almost twice as long as the original
Nov 27 2015,positive,peter jackson reinvents  king kong  and its one of the best motion pictures that i have seen great movie with great special effects that are over the top the 3 hours i didnt mind it was great cause it actually felt like if it was an 1 45 minutes one of the best movies made for the year 2005 as that being said for this being one of the best and having one of the best animal againts animal fighting sequences i give  king kong  an a
Oct 26 2015,neutral,the movie is not bad otherwiese it wouldnt be fresh at over 80 but i simply didnt like it i am a fan of the original kong movies not a die hard fan though and i was totally bored by the first 2h of this movie and then there is still more than one hour to go jesus cut this movie down to like 1h45min leave out all the dinosaur and giant insects stuff and focus on what we want kong
Oct 22 2015,positive,fast paced along with good acting and good effects
Sep 1 2015,neutral,it was great to look at but its entirely too long and drags on more often than not
Aug 22 2015,negative,wonderful special effects and little else
Aug 18 2015,positive,a tad too long but a great film nonetheless the way kong was represented was absolutely great as i couldnt help feeling sorry for him
Aug 12 2015,positive,too long but it is a spectacular movie
Aug 10 2015,positive,king kong is an immensely entertaining remake the story is pretty interesting it can get over the top and silly at times but it works the visual effects are pretty great a few notable green screen effects are the exception but the technical aspects of this film are pretty excellent the acting is quite good and the characters are as well theyre not the most compelling characters but they are sufficient we like them enough to follow them on their wild adventures the relationship between the titular ape and the female lead is surprisingly believable the human drama is pretty decent coming from a good script the movie does have some structural problems in breaking up its action and drama though it is also far too long a king kong movie does not need to be three hours jackson attempts to flesh out side characters and though i appreciate the effort they arent that interesting or necessary to the final product this is a surprisingly well made movie though it is flawed king kong gets 355 stars b
Aug 9 2015,positive,i like the original more then this because of cgi and the girl is in love with a gigantic moneky
Jul 24 2015,positive,jack black was great in this king kong as a whole never really interested me but the special effects were nice
Jul 21 2015,neutral,rating 53  king kong has impressive visuals and all and the script isnt that bad but the characters are dull and the titular character is ironically not that entertaining
Jul 19 2015,positive,sure its overly long and packed to the brim with cgi but i still find it to be intoxicatingly engaging scene after scene im drawn to the presentation and immersed in the narrative its just so much fun i cant help but have a good time
Jul 8 2015,positive,a bloated film that runs at an unnecessary 3 hours and tries too hard that said it still succeeds despite itself you cant help but feel that the first and last acts have a good deal of filler material in it but the 2nd act on skull island is where the film really shines for a pg13 film its brutal many people and creatures die entertainingly  cool and intense deaths and disgusting lots of gross insects and creatures and one pretty grody death naomi watts makes ann darrow into a real character and we believe that she actually has feelings for the big ape adrian brody does a fine job as jack driscoll and even jack black manages to impress every now and then he doesnt convincingly sell all of his lines but most of his reaction shots are believable and his final  classic line is delivered pretty convincingly his character is supposed to be somewhat unlikeable but still likable enough its a right rope that black walks well enough andy serkis performance as kong is also completely believable although i will say he acts way too human at some points the cgi is also pretty good and believable except for a few scenes where it interacts with human characters i will say the cgi 1930s nyc and skull island environments were convincingly done and both were pretty impressive overall this kong is a mixed bag it cant match up to the original classic theres not as many memorable moments here i dont agree with the focus on trying to make this film a huge epic its way too long and its likely a film you wont revisit often but i still found it to be a vastly entertaining and fun ride
Jul 5 2015,positive,cut the beginning an hour and this would be a 45
Jul 2 2015,positive,a fun thrill ride that spans over 3 hours king kong is a great film with good acting and great visuals the actions scenes are good and you actually start to care for the characters too
Jun 27 2015,positive,this movie is one of the most iconic and beutifully mad masterpieces ive ever seen
Jun 26 2015,positive,a big monkey  ape  whatever
Jun 23 2015,positive,king kong is in every sense of the word epic its passionately directed by peter jackson a man who was inspired by the original king kong to become a director its long but there is never a dull moment in it the special effects are absolutely phenomenal and andy serkis brings a tremendous amount of character to the furry ape one of the years best films
Jun 19 2015,positive,extended version is an absolutely amazing adventure movie
Jun 13 2015,positive,the visuals and special effects are amazing but its too tiring to make the full 3 hours
Jun 13 2015,positive,amazing movie to watch
Jun 10 2015,positive,king kong perfectly captures the atmosphere of its time period and the pure adventurous feel of it all is thrilling in itself this is all helped by some of the best special effects put to film in a long long time if theres one thing that keeps the film from being truly great its the casting choices but that can be forgiven when theres so much good here
Jun 6 2015,positive,remake king kong is my favorite movie and the studio tour in hollywood of universal studios with king kong 360 3d
May 27 2015,positive,good movie just way too long
May 24 2015,neutral,an average underrated movie this film is caution to its peers because the film didnt turn out so well and it is very mediocre
May 21 2015,positive,a visually stunning film with a great plot that suffers from a long runtime
May 17 2015,positive,positives   stunning visuals    very exciting 2nd and 3rd acts    epic finale   interesting story line    very exciting action scenes   negatives    weak set of characters    very slow first act   movie over stays its welcome by 1 hour
May 15 2015,positive,including amazing visual effects impressive performances from the cast of jack black naomi watts and storyline that is not at all hard to comprehend king kong is a satisfying blockbuster that will leave you brokenhearted by the end following the edge of your seat climatic spectacular however while the runtime was not an issue for me the major flaw of the film is that naomi watts character is always seemingly helpless nonetheless king king iswithout  a doubtone of the greatest adventureaction stories of our time that is emotionally driven also
May 6 2015,positive,wow yuck 187 mins for and action  adventure movie nah
May 5 2015,positive,its long but entertaining and andy serkis was great as always
May 4 2015,positive,the epic tale of king kong jackson has a very good old fashioned feel to this story and its locations
May 1 2015,negative,what the washing load of crap did i just watch    this is one of the worst peter jackson movies in the universe  king kong is a disgusting reboot and an insult to gorillas and insects  i also hated 1976s film  but this is worse by far i wanted to see how much i hate it and it was not as bad as i thought it was so much worse so much bad cgi green screen and script basically everything is a waste of everybodys time  im here to tell you it isnt funny bad its just shit    score 010
Apr 25 2015,positive,this movie is great dont believe in the flixter score
Apr 19 2015,positive,how in flying hel does this have a 50 on flixter
Apr 17 2015,positive,peter jacksons retelling of the mythical tale suffers from a overlong running time but that hardly matters when others aspects are to be noticed such as its faithful and outstanding script its enormous production design its gorgeous special effects its dramatic buildup and the performances of naomi watts adrien brody jack black and andy serkis all of which serve to make king kong one of the best films of 2005
Apr 12 2015,negative,great cgi bad filmmaking poorly paced bloated selfindulgent and lacking creative discipline takes forever to get started and the end drags on and on and on to the ultimate suspensefree conclusion only of interest to people who got the moviies for cga carnival rides should have been titled king klang
Apr 5 2015,positive,this movie its great
Mar 28 2015,positive,it doesnt stray too far from the original definitely a step up from the 1976 remake some periods of melancholy a decent movie
Mar 26 2015,positive,the only king kong movie better then this is the original king kong this is better then king kong 1976 this movie is better then the sequel to king kong 1933 the song of kong it is better then the 3rd king kong movie king kong vs godzilla it is better then the 4th king kong movie king kong escapes it is also better then the sequel to king kong 1976 king kong lives this a great movie it is very scary see this movie see all the king kong movies they are some of the best monster movie ever
Mar 18 2015,positive,i dont know why a lot of people didnt like this movie i love this remake i think the action scenes are so damn awesome i love it
Mar 18 2015,positive,great acting great special effects and a great story but we spent an hour and a half on that boat which did get a little boring at times but a great build up
Mar 13 2015,positive,despite the overlong runtime peter jacksons king kong is probably jacksons best non middle earth film naomi watts and adrian brodys chemistry is top notch but sometimes confusing since she begins to fall in love with an ape jack black was born for the role of carl denham as he adds his normal jack black wit to the character and also manages a serious action character and kongplayed by andy serkis is magnificent the design of kong is terrific and the character development is great the action scenes are terrific and will have everyone on the edge of their seats with their jaws dropped
Mar 11 2015,positive,this movie was way dragged on it was still a good action movir
Mar 11 2015,positive,a great remake to the 1933 version
Mar 10 2015,positive,abnormally long even the action scenes take time to come in play but its worth the watch the cg is better than most movies i have ever seen
Mar 10 2015,positive,this remake actually had some good story elements added to the original even if they may seem pointless  an example would be how the girl somewhat fell in love with kong after he saved her a couple times  but the movie is long and drawn out and uses slowmo too much  and the battle scenes arent very suspenseful but they dont suck  and you just knew how the movie would end  it always ends that way  if you want to watch a three hour king kong whether you like it or not is your decision
Mar 10 2015,positive,not sure how i missed this remake  they just met the natives on skull island turmoil ensues blood is spilled she screams and kong roars im engrossed
Mar 6 2015,positive,king kong is a must see i consider it to be peter jacksons last great film so far the first hour is undeniably the best during those first 60 minutes jackson perfectly sets the tone a feeling of dread is present as they journey to the island after the ill fated expedition ventures ashore it begins to feel more like an action movie than anything else when it is discovered that kong is not entirely wicked it starts to feel like a love story of sorts     the sudden change of tone is a bit jarring personally i felt that the first half was by far the best however it compensates for its narrative flaws with breathtaking visuals the motion capture used to create kong is particularly impressive an ominous score by harry gregson williams sets the mood of this breathtaking epic    despite some jarring changes of tone king kong is a good film and i highly encourage you to see it a
Mar 4 2015,positive,only problem is the runtime overstayed its welcome
Feb 25 2015,positive,i actually like this version even though i didnt see the original due to its amazing effects nostalgic feel and solid performances
Feb 23 2015,positive,very underrated epic as well as an overlooked remake it is both a retelling of a classic as well as an homage to the original and vintage filmmaking anyways
Feb 13 2015,positive,king kong   is my favorite monster in life tales about ann and kong
Feb 12 2015,negative,great effects but lackluster storytelling and needless padding of a story with little story  even with the great effects its not like it compares with the original the 1933 films effects were stunning and groundbreaking when they first came out so theres really no need to have all these scenes with hundreds of dinosaurs and fights and  ice skating
Feb 10 2015,positive,i love this movie  this movie paid homage to the great willis obrien
Jan 31 2015,positive,amaze with the visual effect but not amaze with the storyline still a pretty good one
Jan 31 2015,positive,another brilliant masterpiece from peter jackson
Jan 29 2015,positive,an incredible achievement which brought in a new level of effects in much the same way the original did full review later
Jan 18 2015,positive,5 stars if you cut out the first hour
Jan 17 2015,positive,a decent enough movie cracking concept and performances for me its just a little drawn out and protracted
Jan 15 2015,positive,i do like this movie a lot although i rather like the setup and the dedication to giving the human cast some time out of the shadow of king kong i can also see why it frustrates people that it takes about an hour to see the title character  it is a beautiful movie and a sad tale and i dont think theres every been an occasion when i havent teared up at the fateful finale and i maintain that it wasnt beauty that killed the beast but most definitely man
Jan 4 2015,positive,my favorite ever since i was little i dont understand the hate for it
Jan 1 2015,negative,an overly serious movie with not so good acting about a big ape   yes i know this is a remake of a classic but i do feel they missed the mark
Jan 1 2015,positive,peter jackson went overboard with his cgi as usual but this time it doesnt work out as well as he hoped it to good film tho i hate the casting choice of jack black hes a comedian not a dramatic actor any other person could of qualified for this role they just need dramatic movies as a background i cant stress enough how perfect this film could of been if it wasnt cgi heavy and if its poor casting choices were fixed even with these minor yet major flaws i give it 4 stars because only peter jackson could of pulled off a blockbuster special effects movie like this one
Dec 31 2014,positive,there are certain things here that absolutely do not work from the screenplay to the performances and even the special effects but within those elements enough greatness still exists so i am willing to forgive the flaws naomi watts might be the key here as she sells the more overtly tragic retelling of the story
Dec 29 2014,positive,everyone loves a good love triangle  especially when it involves a man a woman and  a 25foot gorilla  thats right im talking about the one and only king kong or at least peter jacksons remake of it    of course over 70 years after the original was released it is worth mentioning the advancement of technology since then  the visual effects of king kong are top notch  everything looks great kong the landscapes of skull island and even dinosaurs that would make jurassic park jealous    the cast of king kong is likewise fantastic resulting in some very interesting characters  naomi watts as ann darrow and adrien brody as jack driscoll are both excellent leads though i dont entirely buy their whirlwind romance  also its refreshing to see jack black in a role where he isnt making fart jokes  but seriously he does deliver a good performance as the sly deceitful carl denham  and of course i have to mention the excellent motion capture work done by andy serkis which brought kong to life    this film suffers mostly from its slow pace  for example it is 70 minutes into the film before kong makes his first appearance  while the slow pace allows for plenty of character development it makes certain parts of the film drag on    peter jacksons overlong remake of this hollywood classic is certainly a beautiful work of art but it is a loooong 3 hours to sit through  that said it is well worth it because this king kong pays great homage to the original
Dec 27 2014,positive,well its the best king kong ive seem
Dec 21 2014,positive,i see this film as an incentric story about this women and this creature that have this bone to one to another and its beautiful really its a great piece of art by peter jackson that represent  the old times very differently and in a new perspective
Dec 19 2014,positive,while yes the film could have been about 40 minutes shorter but really thats inconsequential  the entire film is first class in every way from minute 1 to minute 200
Dec 19 2014,positive,amazing visuals fantastic acting good drama decent plot incredible action loved the extra time spent setting things up to me the longer the movie the more moneysworth as long as its good storytelling imo king kong could not have been done better
Dec 7 2014,positive,a fun epic movie with cuttingedge vfx and the very reason why i want to be a filmmaker this is a worthy remake of the 1933 masterpiece of the same name
Dec 5 2014,positive,bloated and as silly as can be but entertaining
Dec 4 2014,positive,great movie but drags on a bit too much near the end
Nov 29 2014,positive,kong the eighth wonder of the world      king kong is a epic adventure film from directed cowritten and produced by peter jackson the lord of the rings saga braindead and remake of the 1933 film with the same title who doesnt know the story of a group of filmmakers that travels to a mysterious island where they come eyetoeye with a gigantic gorilla this is one of the remakes that dares to overpower the original one with eye for detail this 187 minutes adventure is brilliant in every way the setting the effects the plot and the thrills and emotions are astonishingly good in its cast we see adrien brody splice predators naomi watts the impossible funny games jack black school of rock shallow hal kyle chandler super 8 the wolf of wall street jamie bell billy eliot nymphomaniac and andy serkis the lord of the rings saga the cottage as kong    1932 troublesome filmmaker carl denham black hires poor actress ann darrow watts to act in his new film that will be shot on location ann agrees as she learns that her favorite writer jack driscoll brody is the screenwriter along with film crew and actor bruce daxtor chandler they step on board of the steamer ss venture and leave new york on the sea jack and ann grow closer together and learn that they are sailing toward the mysterious skull island     during a storm the vessel gets stuck between rocks and denham orders his crew to go to shore to work on his movie on the island they see that the island has a very large wall and meet the vicious natives who attack them after being rescued by captain englehorn and his sailors the film crew agrees to return to the ship but then ann is kidnapped by the natives in a ritual ceremony she is offered to the creature behind the wall as jack and the others witness how a gigantic gorilla takes the blonde woman with him carl has an idea that could make him both rich and famous
Nov 28 2014,positive,this movie is epic in every sense of the word the directing and cinematography are incredible you feel like you are part of the journey on the island it is a top notch adventure movie but it is also a very good drama movie the cg is so good that you actually feel for kong his expressions are very believable plus the master of motion capture andy serkis brings all kongs movements to life all the actors bring their a game considering a huge percentage of the movie is green screen acting the movie is lengthy but you dont feel it great movie
Nov 28 2014,negative,overly long boring overactioned spectacle
Nov 24 2014,positive,one of the best films that i have ever seen beautifully shot extremely touching and featuring an amazing cast that is highlighted by the brilliant andy serkis as kong    plenty of time for character development great writing and an outstanding score make this an absolute mustsee    just make sure you have the dedication to sit this one through the only thing that i can really dock it for is the length but that being said it was time wellspent
Nov 23 2014,positive,a underrated masterpiece of a film
Nov 8 2014,positive,while unnecessarily long it dose its job well it gives kong character and makes us feel for him which makes it devastating when he meets his end there is also alot more chemistry between kong and ann much more than in the 1933 version and even if you didnt like this movie youve go to admit the fight between kong and the three trexes is pretty awesome
Nov 8 2014,negative,intolerably long and special effects driven king kong is a giant clusterfck  when a shady filmmaker takes a crew to the mysterious skull island for his latest picture they end up in a fight for their lives against savage natives and giant monsters  while jackson pays homage to the original film in a lot of ways he also subverts it with some dramatic changes such as rewriting carl denham to be a shyster  but what hurts the film most is the excessiveness scenes go on three times as long as they should and end up killing all of the wonder and excitement that they initially create  the green screen work is also a problem as the actors are poorly integrated into the cgi backgrounds and never quite blend in  an untamed mess king kong is overblown and unfocused
Nov 5 2014,positive,fantastic despite the long length
Nov 1 2014,positive,i was utterly taken on a journey with this film much like the journey peter jackson took me on with the lotr trilogy suspense anticipation horror awe thrills exhilaration tragedy theyre all here in a dazzling cinematic experience i wont forget
Oct 28 2014,positive,predictable but better than original well acted and with a good argument
Oct 25 2014,negative,spoiler alert so you go to an island and find a big ape and a bunch of dinosaurrsss real live onesand you decide to bring back the ape not the extinct dinosaurs this movie is super super stupid
Oct 23 2014,positive,the most underrated remake ever made
Oct 20 2014,positive,besides the atrociously slow boat sequences at the beginning king kong is a wicked and stunning film both visually and in the action
Oct 20 2014,positive,predictable but better than original well acted and with a good script
Oct 19 2014,negative,im sorry but i hated this one i absolutely love the original black and white version but this one bites the bullet there was one part i liked where he fought the dinosaur but other than that this movie had the exact opposite feel of the first in the original it was a tale of a menacing beast who may have fallen for the girl he was still evil this one they tried making a love story and im sorry but love and giant monster ape doesnt fit well for me the director peter jackson is a great director for movies such as lord of the rings but this one he messed up big time i feel its highly overrated but thats just me
Oct 4 2014,positive,both as a remake and a stand alone film 2005s remake of king kong works i agree that the length may be a bit unnecessary and there are some moments worth poking fun at with that said though kong more than makes up for it with amazing special effects great performances and just a sense of wonder terror love sadness and tragedy mixing this elements together and you have what i consider a wonderful movie
Sep 29 2014,positive,peter jacksons king kong might not be that memorable but everyone knows how epic the film was it is excitingly fun and extremely well made naomi watts eyes towards the cgi king kong is just breathtaking and just pure love there are some cgi flaws which gives over the top sequences but nonetheless it was beautifully stunning superb cinematography that jackson made this long dramatic and epic thinking this was one of the best adventure epics that we will be seeing in such a long long time
Sep 28 2014,positive,better than original
Sep 11 2014,neutral,in peter jacksons film king kong were taken to an island where everything has grown to gargantuan proportions and tries to eat you he also takes us to a place where the jurassic period hasnt ended yet heres the bad stuff its long 3 hours and 7 minutes long theres no plot the cast just runs around from dinosaurs and bugs the entire time but worst of all the relationship between the naomi watts character and kong doesnt make sense does she love him is she in love with him i dont know yet oddly enough youll like the film its entertaining the action sequences are fun and despite its long run time the film goes by fast its over before you know it what is good about king kong is the fact it stays consistent with its fantastical nature its okay to be plotless ridiculous at times and even sometimes absurd just as long as its fun pretty has good music as for all you fans of the original king kong and i am talking about the 1933 version youll be pleasantly surprised that it stays relatively close to its predecessor jackson even attempts to give it a throwback style of look in short king kong is a fun and entertaining adventure
Sep 9 2014,positive,beautifully made film with great special effects by weta and fantastic set designs as well  but what else would you expect from peter jackson  the story is a bit on the long side particularly the first act but its also setting up the story and the characters  a very solid performance from the cast and specifically naomi watts
Sep 8 2014,positive,this remake was a very nicely made
Sep 8 2014,positive,great adventure flick i wish i lived on that island lol
Sep 5 2014,positive,this is a pretty nice remake i never seen the old king kongs it was more realistic to take place in the 1930s this is equally good as the dawn of the planet of the apes
Sep 2 2014,positive,87  peter jacksons lovable direction and andy serkiss emotionally resonant motioncapture performance are enough to pull audiences in the three hour runtime notwithstanding    v 70
Aug 28 2014,negative,are you serious 84 of critics liked this whats wrong with you seriously critics just quit we can do this better
Aug 25 2014,positive,staggeringly good the most original adventure film out there prepare for one of the strangest plots a towering performance from naomi watts forces you to feel the emotional power of the bond she gradually forms with a huge computergenerated gorilla how does jackson do it who knows  but it works and works sublimely leaves the viewer breathless
Aug 19 2014,positive,i watch king kong movie over and over
Aug 19 2014,negative,looooooooooooooong boooooooooooring hammy and ridiculous the hell happened peter jackson please skip urgh the taste it left in my mouth
Aug 17 2014,positive,after finishing one of the best trilogies every put to film peter jackson decided that a second remake of the classic 1933 king kong was going to be his follow up film two years after his multiple academy award winner the return of the king  its 1933 at the peak of the great depression we follow an actress named ann darrow who agrees to be part in a new film by a troublesome director named carl denham denham is obsessed with finding the mysterious skull island and filming his movie there so he manages to hire a tramp steamer to make his obsession come true but once they find the island they discover a creature that may kill them all   with jackson at head of this film and counting with some a list actors some of them are actors i really enjoy seeing  expectations about making a worthy retell of the eighth wonder of the world were high but unfortunately jackson deliver an uneven film with some memorable moments in it but also counting with serious pacing issues the acting is functional but there isnt anyone that stands out the action scenes are pretty but arent engaging bland characters with absolutely no character arc hollywood managed to get kong right by having serkis doing the motion capture the special effects were phenomenal at the time but unfortunately now they look a little dated the editing is a little weird and even becomes annoying at certain sections of the film beautiful locations that are enhance by a well done cinematography and while the story is known by everyone it still has some memorable moments worth all the waiting the biggest problem with 2005 king kong is jacksons slow pacing jackson give us tons of unnecessary scenes just because he wanted to make a three hour movie some people argue that kong is just a supporting character in his own film but i dont have a problem with the fact it takes some time to see kong because i like some build up when is done well that being said kong appears after a boring and forgettable hour of needless exposition that never goes anywhere another problem with the pacing is the fact the supporting characters are even more develop than the protagonists themselves and after spending two and a half hours with them they are thrown away in the final section so whats the point in having them   jacksons version of king kong is a beautifully shot but hollow experience that wastes its talented cast with forgettable characters and an unnecessary slow pace
Aug 17 2014,positive,great special effects good story and some fantastic performances as far as remakes go this one in my opinion surpasses the original with ease
Aug 16 2014,positive,gigantic dinosaur gorilla fights airplanes to the death after falling in love with a blonde actress on skull island
Aug 15 2014,positive,movie was phenomenalgreat special effects and an awesome roller coaster ride you really come to know the king of beasts king kong rules
Aug 14 2014,positive,the best version of king kong so far
Aug 11 2014,positive,the only thing that i love was andy serkiss amazing performance would i want to see it again maybe not
Aug 10 2014,positive,at first i was like is this a king kong movie i loved the first king kong movies peter jackson is a great director loved the lord of the rings trilogy by peter jackson i really want the video game i heard it has great graphics and everything jack black is just awesome in this part
Aug 6 2014,positive,awesome movie  from the great peter jackson
Aug 6 2014,positive,excellent performances and topnotch special effects allow peter jacksons king kong to replace the original in my book
Aug 5 2014,negative,bloated overlong and filled with largely uninteresting characters proof that excellent special effects alone cannot overcome bad plotting pace and characterization
Jul 29 2014,positive,best cgi ive seen since gravity
Jul 27 2014,neutral,pretty average but doesnt beat the original
Jul 27 2014,positive,this is an amazing movie the original one is better but i thoroughly enjoy this one
Jul 26 2014,positive,the first hour of the film is mostly compelling a bit slow with a spectacular hairraising sea arrival at skull island  sweeping cinematic film making certainly makes this film visually stunning  but it could have used some liberal judicious editing to tighten it up  naomi watts gives it her all and certainly gives the film a tremendous lift
Jul 22 2014,positive,one of the best films ever
Jul 20 2014,positive,extremely entertaining thrilling action packed and way better than the original
Jul 17 2014,positive,i really enjoyed this film i agree the film was to long and for that a lot of people didnt like it but seriously people if you dont have time to watch a three hour movie then dont watch it the movie had great visual effects and it was a lot of fun
Jul 13 2014,negative,looked cooler than i thought barley any action from king kong
Jul 13 2014,positive,creature feature week continues and this time since aoes ruled the multiplexs this weekend lets review a gorilla movie surprisingly i didnt expect myself to like this movie since its a remake of one of my favorite movies of all time but i was super duper surprised to find out that it was all right my main problem i had with this movie were the characters well dont get me wrong the actors did great but characters like carl denham and jack driscoll are really weird in the movie adrien brodys character had this really weird accent on him like he was jewish or something then jack black comes into the movie and he is really horrible in this carl denial is an idiot to me and he just does idiotic stuff way thourghout the movie naomi watts does a great job in this movie you can see how she interacts with king kong and she does a great job expressing her fear and likeableness to king kong the effects on king kong are fantastic and are pretty to look at andy serkis is always awesome and in this movie he proves himself to be one of the best actors alive then the other human characters in this movie are just really plain stupid morons they just act like there the dumbest things on the earth and in the movie for that matter there is one  scene in the movie were jack black and his friends are on this island and they run into dinosaurs and they try to run away from them the effects on the dinosaurs are some of the most worst effects that i have seen in movie history its even worse then the deer in tammy or rocky and bullwinkle in the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle back from 2000 the movie also has other redeeming qualities like actors like jamie bell and craig hall give good performances  also i did laugh sometimes in this movie another gripe i have to address is that king kong doesnt show up until halfway into the movie my problem is that the movie is called king kong but he doesnt show up for a long time until halfway into it like i said but king kong has so much less screen time then the other characters in the movie it just feels like they wasted the creature but the movie isint horrible not even close but the limited screentime they give to him is my real problem with the movie well thats all there is to say about the movie next time were reviewing rise of the planet of the apes since the sequel came out all ready until tomorrow everybody bye bye and stay safe
Jul 12 2014,positive,a movie with staggering scope and confounding spectacle that only peter jackson could even think of creating
Jul 5 2014,positive,a remake of the original 1933 film that is full of wonder and mystery just like the original though i felt that some parts in the beginning of the movie were unneeded
Jul 4 2014,positive,while it can be too long its still an awesome journey of romanceactionhorror and adventure
Jul 1 2014,positive,absolutely breathtaking movie but is still really really long
Jun 29 2014,positive,this is an awesome movie on both a technical and emotional level
Jun 29 2014,positive,frankly i am surprised towards the ratings of this movie from part of the audience this was not a cheap little remake that shames on the original although it deviated from it i thought it was decent and worth the time watching it     yes indeed the acting could have used more work and the execution could have been better    otherwise its worth watching
Jun 27 2014,negative,bloated violent and very poorly cast this king kong remake is boring and silly even if it isnt compared to the 1933 masterpiece
Jun 26 2014,positive,while the film may take about an hour to kick off when it does it really does with not only top notch action pacing and music on par with jurassic park but it mixes in comedy drama and suspense and blends them perfectly keeping one from destracting the other king kong is not only great popcorn entertainment and a perfect remake but an excellent film experience in general
Jun 21 2014,positive,very good tribute to the original
Jun 18 2014,positive,the film was spectacular i dont see the need to compare it to the original since it is obvious to all film makers that the original is always the best the sfx were great and the story had me on the edge of my seat along with all the giant insects and creatures on the island
Jun 18 2014,positive,good remake one of the best ones i have seen so far
Jun 8 2014,positive,king kong benefits from superb visual effects and the talents of andy serkis even if it is hamstrung by poor casting choices an unnecessary save jimmy subplot and an excessive run time
Jun 8 2014,positive,a fun spectacle that is definitely too long
Jun 6 2014,positive,fuck everything this is a beautiful film
Jun 4 2014,positive,first 25 minutes should of been cut it was pointless filler and really boring
Jun 2 2014,neutral,sad that i have to say i couldnt find myself watching this ever again once is definitely enough
Jun 2 2014,negative,the cast choices are terrible and it becomes too much of a distraction after a while a porky jack black as carl denham was almost forgivable but it was adrien brody as jack driscoll the supposing dashing action star that really raises some questions the special effects is a saving grace as jackson brings the big hairy monster to the big screen
Jun 1 2014,positive,there isnt really anything id change worth the threehour investment
May 31 2014,positive,solid effects great performances especially by serkis in the role of kong
May 29 2014,negative,this has to be one of the most surprisingly overrated disaster movies of al time the effects in this ape flick are overused from the stuttering slowmo action shots to the extremely unrealistic carrying of naomi watts by the title character yes the ape itself was well created and there were a few good performances but all in all the overdependence on visual effects and attempt at drama make you wonder how this could possibly have been directed by the mind behind the universallyacclaimed lord of the rings franchise
May 29 2014,positive,a great interesting and entertaining reboot jack black should stick to comedy though
May 28 2014,neutral,was not bad but could have been so much better  it had some good elements but sometimes the special effects were not so great and the action scenes involving people completely unrealistic and cheesy  most of the more dramatic scenes were pretty good but one closer to the end was really cheesy  overall the story could have been brought to the early 21st century in a far more compelling way than this  it does come off at times as too much 21st century flash and special effects at the cost of some of the storyline
May 28 2014,positive,heres another example of peter jackson taking a short story and dragging it out way longer then it should have been the original was 1 and 45 mins long jackson drags it out over what seems a lifetime the effects are good but it still doesnt look real its too fluid and perfect to be real life there are great parts to it like not setting in present day like the one before jack black plays his role well but naomi watts is a bit annoying its not as bad as the last one but not a patch on the original
May 25 2014,positive,king kongs death made me crypeter jackson at his finest
May 24 2014,positive,extremely long but very entertaining
May 23 2014,positive,clearly this is one of the most underrated movies of all time and is definitely the most underrated remake of all time peter jackson is definitely one the best directors of modern times
May 22 2014,positive,its good but it needed to be shorter
May 21 2014,neutral,this remake of king kong improves on the characters especially the interaction between ann darrow and king kong and adds in far superior effects as one would expect it mostly moves away from the racist undertones which kong embodied in the original also a plus even jack black as the director somehow works despite my skepticism  however the movie tends to drag on excessively and devolve into a long series of weird creature attacks people the crew fight it off or run then move on to the next peril it could have easily lost 45 minutes1 hour of run time
May 20 2014,positive,made with obvious affection for the 1933 original peter jacksons king kong is a thrilling spectaclefilled emotionally satisfying piece of entertainment that despite a formidable length provides an engrossing blend of action and drama
May 19 2014,positive,i had fun watching this
May 17 2014,negative,kong gets a second star as the effects are good  the action is moderately entertaining but the story is lacking  the setting being in the early 1900s was very appealing in premise alone  the execution was not worth building all the period sets and vehicles    monster island was so over done it seemed as though that could be a whole movie  it really was kong visits jurassic park  as hard as it may be to imagine the attachment this ape has to naomi watts is more ridiculous and bizarre than the last two iterations  if you watch this one  fast forward to the action  that might make it worth seeing
May 15 2014,positive,this is a faithful and epic remake that pays a great homage to the original classic be advised this is peter jacksons version of king kong yes the lord of the rings guy so expect some action and a long running time i highly recommend it if youre a fan of the original classic andor a fan of peter jackson
May 13 2014,positive,this movie is a criminally underrated experience discounting this film just because of its 3 hour length is wrong yes it is to long but how do you forget the epic fights and surprising moments of beauty it is an expertly crafted adventure that startles and scares you
May 13 2014,positive,if i lived in 1933 i probably would have liked the original more but with peter jacksons faithful nods and even joking with dare i say it the cardboard acting of the original this is one kong that is literally one to fall for if youre like naomi watts oh and james newton howards music once again is epic
May 13 2014,positive,well directed and pretty epic however this movie could of have been way better even tho it was pretty entertaining and interesting they took way too long to show king kong and not only that they didnt show enough of king kong wrecking the city and him against the military other than that the movie was solidly brilliant i give this movie a b
May 11 2014,positive,this movie made me fall in love with cinema and filmmaking and for that i thank it
May 11 2014,positive,its length is formidable no thanks to the paddedout boat scenes but king kong is still powerfully acted and boasts great action scenes and impressive cgi
May 9 2014,positive,let me tell a story its 2005 im a ten year old a ten year old growing up in the 21st century mind you so naturally im not going to have any patience yet with no snacks or parents to distract me peter jacksons king kong kept that ten year old kid enthralled throughout its three hour duration thats gotta say something about this movie
May 4 2014,negative,looks great but its fallasleep on the spot boring
May 2 2014,positive,visually amazing with great performances
Apr 27 2014,positive,underrated peter jackson epic its not great but is soooo much better than 99 of the comic book super hero blockbuster garbage they regurgitate every summer at least it has acting a plot and character development
Apr 27 2014,positive,king kong has heart and wants to show it in the movie and it shows beautifully a director of luxury for a perfect remake wellembedded actors who know their roles well dominate sometimes magnificent visual effects other times very little worked sometimes i feel like start to cry when i see the death of kong it gives me grief better than the original different because this film is made in an era with many visual improvements
Apr 26 2014,neutral,if every scene was cut to half its time this movie would be good
Apr 22 2014,positive,impressive effects but excessive and overdone
Apr 20 2014,positive,i have never seen the original so in this case i wasnt bothered by the fact that they remade it  for what its worth i think this is an excellent movie and while not as emotionally evocative as the the lord of the rings it is just as exciting  for me it basically serves what the two jurassic park sequels never really managed even though amazingly the dinosaurs still dont look as good
Apr 19 2014,positive,peter jacksons remake of king kong gives the original a visual update while retaining the epic engrossing story that made it a classic
Apr 12 2014,negative,way to long way to much filler
Apr 12 2014,positive,great film but toooo long
Apr 5 2014,neutral,this movie was great but it was way too long the first half of the movie was really boring and made me fall asleep
Mar 31 2014,positive,not like the original but enjoyable still
Mar 31 2014,positive,three hours of compelling storytelling stunning performances and staggering special effects king kong couldve been longer its one of few movies where i wanted more     when a film crew and ship crew are attacked and split up on mysterious skull island they come across a hostile tribe and masses of deadly creatures but deep within the island awaits an enormous beast there are so many rich subplots and vivid backstories and threats on the island id rather you experience them for yourself rather than have me explain them just watch this and youll be immersed in this beautiful world directed by peter jackson     naomi watts is absolutely incredible as ann darrow a down on her luck actress who is whisked away on an adventure watts looks amazing her passion expressions of terror love and happiness dominate the screen one of my all time favourites performances jack black is superb as a selfish and rather desperate filmmaker who takes ann on his adventure and its when these characters stumble upon the horror of the island they develop as characters andy serkis facial capture and body movement work are as good as ever bringing kong to life my favourite scene is where jack driscoll lumpy and jimmy fall into a pit of darkness and as the light beams down a legion of giant sized slimy oozy bugs emerge consuming their prey in disgusting ways its a harrowing moment and very dark this is where jacksons direction gets tense and packed with threat with spectacle beyond anything ive ever seen and a massive heart to match its title character king kong is a near perfect adventure
Mar 23 2014,negative,real waste of time  peter jackson should see the original 1933 movie and see how great that movie is as the script is excellent and made very gripping peter has all modern gadgets  but he lacks skills in making a good movie  i felt really bad watching this movie
Mar 19 2014,positive,visually stunning epic remake of the old 1933 film this one has a fine cast of characters and visuals that are simply breathtaking loved seeing jack black in a more serious role overall excellent stuff here  its long but does well in filling the time with great visuals and interactions
Mar 12 2014,positive,a nutshell review  awesomeness
Mar 8 2014,positive,king kong is petty good in terms of story and acting but its 187 minute runtime makes it feel like youre watching it for a month while movies like lawrence of arabia and gone with the wind may be justifiably long king kong isnt
Feb 26 2014,positive,absolutely amazing the only scene i didnt like was the dinosaur avalanche
Feb 26 2014,positive,excellent performances and topnotch special effects allow peter jacksons king kong to replace the original in my book
Feb 25 2014,negative,this film fucking sucked  first off let me say that im not a fan of the original king kong even though its a classic staple in the bmovie franchise  sorry its just not that good and is quite overrated if one was to ask me  so another king decided to remake this film but he is no good king  no were talking the legendary king of the bronies peter jackson behind the camera  okay so many people were excited about this film due to his involvement  was i one  ehhhh maybe  i mean im all in for a good creature feature but kong just wasnt my style      upon first viewing in 05 i thought this film was great  mainly cause of the big action set pieces and the tragedy of kong as a character  so that was like 9 years ago and upon viewing it on monday i was shocked at how bad it was  my taste sure has adapted  for better or worse i have no clue  kongs first major problem is its rather terrible pacing  many scenes are dragged out to fit the entire 3 hour runtime and it really does feel rusty after seeing the same scene over and over again  the film plods and it doesnt let up  i mean i dont want a 1 hour version of it but at least make the film a little shorter    jackson was being pretty ambitious with this project  remaking a cult classic right after coming away with 3 of the most critically and financially acclaimed films  then he wants to make this  the result is admirable but of course the film leaves much especially in the acting department  jack black can be a good drama actor after viewing bernie but here hes completely shoddy  his character can sometimes be unintentionally funny especially in the serious scenes  naomi watts who is one of my favorite actresses ever is completely wasted here  i mean her role is big but she definitely missed the mark and again there are some unintentionally funny moments with her  adrien brody is adrien brody aka the white snoop dog  interpret that as you will  its not that there is bad acting going much less bad directing      the dialogue in this film ranges from unintentional funny moments to rather groan worthy lines to decent lines  the script rings with cheese but jackson takes the film too seriously  twas beauty that killed the beast  yeah nice try king brony  its obvious that he was trying to go for an action adventure shakespeareanesque tragedy mixing in lines of dialogue fitted for the 16th century rather than the 20th  its a try and ill give him that      the action scenes and special effects have been receiving acclaim for its stunning realism  while i do agree that at times the effects do look stunning there are moments where it looks terrible namely when kong fights the vrex not trex vrex  im sorry but it just didnt work in that scene  just look at naomi watts in kongs hand and youll see what im talking about  then theres the dinosaur race scene and while pretty cool to look at its just too silly to be taken seriously  sorry that im supposed to care about these onedimensional characters    which brings me to my next complaintthe film has barely any character development  sure the scene where kong and watts interact has some but theres only like 2 or 3 scenes like that  everyone is just a cardboard cutout set on this film to either die or cause trouble  for a film thats fucking 3 hours long it takes a long time to get to character development and when most of the people die i would laugh rather than feel sorrow  seriously when those teeth penis worms ate that one irish i literally gave no fucks  not a single fuck  even when kong died my fuck still wasnt awarded to jackson    thentheres the silly overthetop ending  look i know that its an iconic ending but it really sucks  kong climbs to the top of the empire state building with his booty call and for the sake of love he dies  note he is shot up by planes  listen i can see why this would be tragic but its also very silly  watching a cg monkey destroy planes is absolutely the worst part and for the same reason everything else in this film sucks its given this so serious treatment  this is why these kong movies will forever be inferior to the godzilla movies  they take themselves too seriously  it leads to one of the most pretentious films ever    in the end i really realized how terrible my taste was a decade ago  king brony finally takes a stab at his fellow king  does it fail  yeah in every conceivable manner besides a comedy  its hilariously pretentious and i actually laughed at it  however i also laugh at the godzilla films so why do i like those but hate this  well the godzilla films are not to be taken seriously but this this film think its some revolutionary monster flick when in reality its just hiding behind a thin veil of terrible acting directing and  in some respect cgi  butnaomi watts is still beautiful to look at so 1
Feb 25 2014,negative,again another movie in which the critics are out of touch with reality
Feb 24 2014,positive,a remake that other remakes need to follow
Feb 22 2014,positive,i consider this movie to be in my top 10 favorites list its so good its breathtaking i fell in love when i saw it for the first time when i was in the 5th grade it blew me away and the music took me to another place it was epic love love love king kong
Feb 21 2014,positive,really long slow start bug as soon as the action begins it never stops lots of horrors but with emotion i never liked the ending though
Feb 21 2014,negative,visually where they spent money paid off other than those few moments this movie is crap
Feb 19 2014,positive,visually fantastic and with a beautiful storyline that doesnt withdrawl from the original king kong is a terrific remake that deserves to be watched again and again
Feb 19 2014,positive,very great special effects
Feb 17 2014,positive,this movie is great if you think its too long get over it
Feb 16 2014,positive,quite literally my favorite film of all time it had comedy drama action thriller and horror all in one movie and it pulled it off ever so perfectly
Feb 16 2014,positive,80  its not that boring adhd people its three hours of fun and popcorn action just enjoy the shit out of it assholes
Feb 10 2014,positive,my favorite roll jack black has ever done
Feb 4 2014,positive,people may not like it but for what its worth this movie recreates the original in a interesting way jack black takes it completely serious which is a good thing and proves that he can be serious
Jan 29 2014,positive,this king kong epic is a highly underrated movie this adaptation of king kong is one of the most spectacular films ive ever seen in terms of special effects this movie is intense highly entertaining and even heartfelt the acting is great the movie overall is very effective and this is by far peter jacksons best work
Jan 29 2014,positive,people will complain about the run time but when a movie is as great a spectacle as this one is run time doesnt matter  i didnt even realize it was three hours long until i had finished watching it i was engrossed the entire time  while i still prefer the original this movie serves a great purpose as to bring the story of king kong back to life for those who refuse to watch the original because the effects are too korny or outdated which indeed they are but it still doesnt matter  it doesnt try to surpass the original it simply is here to recreate the amazing story with much stronger visual effects for modern stubborn america
Jan 29 2014,positive,i have to say that i love this movie and it was a chance for jack black redemption which i saw i love colin hanks and think that he did well too i liked the story line thought the cinematography was compelling and have watched it more than once i thought it was just right in length to wrap up the story without rushing the ending and athough i didnt care for them taking kong back to the city i guess thats how the story goes i did like this movie
Jan 28 2014,positive,loved it i think this is the best remake of all time
Jan 28 2014,positive,wonderfully done visually but lacks in dialogue strength
Jan 18 2014,positive,my favorite movie of all time and not just because of nastolgia i love this movie so much i cant do it justice just watch it
Jan 4 2014,neutral, lush engrossing visuals   overlength kong as ape on all fours rather than classic monster on two feet
Jan 4 2014,positive,yes its slightly overlong theatrical 187 minutes extended 201 minutes but you cannot deny that it is an emotional and powerful epic director peter jackson who also helmed the lord of the rings trilogy once again brings us a memorable visually stunning adventure
Jan 2 2014,positive,peter jackson proves he is perhaps hollywoods greatest tentpole director especially in regards to his weta digital effects atelier from the simian on the poster to the prehistoric crickets that maul the stranded crew members the film is a new pinnacle in the field of cgi the acting is commendable as well additionally the interaction between ann and the king is true to form and the most captivating aspect of the film
Jan 1 2014,positive,the film itself is superb on a technical level but the incredibly and annoyingly slow pacing and lack of any strong characters apart from kong himself make this movie almost a chore to watch and leaves the viewer unmoved and uninspired
Dec 31 2013,positive,one of my favourites adrien brody is immense
Dec 27 2013,positive,far too long yet satisfyingly thrilling and aesthetically astounding well done mr jackson
Dec 25 2013,positive,a visual marvel full of exciting sequences beautiful vistas and an incredible attention to detail it is overlong but not excessive and the characters do fall flat for the most part especially egregious is the relationship between first mate hayes and troubled youth jimmy its a relationship that ends up feeling incredibly contrived the real star is the titular character himself and the special effects artists behind him
Dec 25 2013,positive,i honestly love this movie to death i know people are always like the old one is better im sorry but youre wrong yes they didnt have the technology we have today but overall peter jackson shows us an excellent version of the eighth wonder of wonder of the world
Dec 25 2013,positive,great film in almost every way the only bad thing about the film is that it doesnt need to be 3 hours long
Dec 24 2013,positive,a fantastically made masterpeace witch is better than the original
Dec 21 2013,positive,if i were to give a list of under appreciated movies peter jacksons king kong would definitely be on it theres probably too much cgi and its just a tad too long but overall this movie delivers
Dec 18 2013,positive,peter jacksons best film  yes really
Dec 18 2013,positive,no idea why this is rated so low solid film when i watched it as a kid solid film now
Dec 14 2013,negative,the beginning is great then the characters land in the island and the film becomes extraordinarily slow and uninteresting the battle scene between kk and the dinosaur belongs in an anthology of cinematic boredom
Dec 11 2013,positive,although long this is an epic film in every sense of the word and a surprising turn from jack black
Dec 10 2013,positive,not really a movie for mass audiences but more like a loveletter to movies as a whole    it is incredibly long sure  and sometimes pete jackson can get excessive  but really if you have 3 hours to waste why the hell not
Dec 9 2013,positive,director peter jackson scores with rousing epic remake of the iconic 1933 classica deeper film than most may be expecting filled with thought provoking metaphors and symbolism
Dec 9 2013,positive,this was exactly like the first king kong movie peter jackson did a well done film
Dec 8 2013,positive,not one for remakes this was one worth doing as it truly benefitted from the new technology without having that detract from the story  while i think jack blacks performance was a bit too caricaturishto coin a term the others especially naomi watts make up for it this is an excellent date movie
Dec 8 2013,positive,peter jackson reimagines the classic tale of king kong in a way that no remake has in the past couple yearsits actually good
Dec 7 2013,positive,an amazing reimagination of the story of king kong jake blacks greatest performance
Dec 6 2013,positive,and lo the beast looked upon the face of beauty and beauty stayed his hand and from that day forward he was as one dead
Dec 6 2013,positive,at first i thought this was gonna be a crappy remake of the 1933 film how wrong i was this is actually a very decent remake with the best cgi effects ever theres also a great cast as well thanks mr jackson
Dec 5 2013,positive,almost certainly the greatest remake of the 2000s reinterpretation would probably be a better name as it takes the original and looks at it from a wild new perspective intense beautiful and shows jacksons love for the original length could be an issue for some but jackson is the master of the 3 hour epic and holds the audiences attention like a hypnotist
Nov 29 2013,positive,a fairly underrated film that while not as good as the original king kong still manages to keep the spirit of it gives kong himself a personality and has some pretty good acting even for jack black  i didnt really mind how long it was either long films dont bother me
Nov 28 2013,negative,at least it was funny
Nov 25 2013,positive,while it suffers from length and a stretch of the imagination its still an interesting piece
Nov 25 2013,positive,the movie was 3 hours long but i could have watched it even longer
Nov 23 2013,positive,embodying the true meaning of epic peter jacksons king kong is an extravagant special effects spectacle while it may run long jacksons love and respect to the original classic makes this a worthy action packed remake
Nov 21 2013,negative,king kong 2005 angered me as a fan of the original as a critic and just as a movie viewer first off what was peter jackson thinking the green screen overkill cgi abuse and bad acting was horrendous the first hour was entertaining and had me curious but upon landing on skull island i soon was ready for this journey to end the dinosaur stampede that ended up in what felt like a half hour session of them tripping over each other was the point that made me go from feeling boredom to pure disgust adrien brody and cast were running in front of endless green screens and it got old fast the cast was full of talented individuals jack black adrien brody kyle chandler colin hanks but alas even the best actors can wind up in terrible films every now and then    the characters hayes and jimmy the sailors were completely unnecessary and i could have cared less about their existence in the world of kong speaking of characters what was up with the ridiculous disney style sailors and 1930s dorks sprinkled throughout this big budget flop the acting was awful the dialogue was written for incredibly stupid audiences and the look of this film was like that of an early play station 2 video game overall with the massive budget the crew the size of an army and a decent cast peter jackson and company really dropped the ball on this one peter your mother and i arent mad just disappointed okay and a little mad what a waste of time money and most of all potential this will be looked back on in fifty years and people will laugh at how reliant early 2000s filmmakers were on cgi ill take the 1933 classic over this any day
Nov 19 2013,positive,its a little overstuffed but you cant help but feel in awe of the film
Nov 15 2013,positive,peter jackson has modernized king kong in an epic awesome gorgeous intense way
Nov 13 2013,positive,king kong has better special effects then the 1933 original but back then i bet the special effects were kick butt now not so much the original is better then this
Nov 9 2013,positive,good remake of a classic  didnt care much for jack blacks character but overall the movie was enjoyable with loads of action
Nov 5 2013,positive,kong the 8th wonder of the world in the hands of the lord of the rings trilogy director peter jackson better than the original worse than the original   peter jackson directs his version of the mighty ape which is basically the same just more stuff added to it and a way longer time run 3hrs to be exact  but does that make the movie bad not necessarily but doesnt make the story better either it has more action and gives certain characters more character development especially kong who does have feelings and emotions being the ape that he is  peter jackson also directs this flick very well especially the scene where kong verses the trexs yup rexs he fights not one not two but three trexs now thats badass  overall the film is actually enjoyable if you can get passed that its 3 hours long good movie and a good remake of the classic 8th wonder of the world
Nov 4 2013,positive,this movie just got me it was a long run but amazing acting and emotionsthe king kong makes us cry too
Nov 2 2013,positive,really only 53 of the audience liked this im surprised
Oct 29 2013,positive,i will agree its a little overlong why jackson applied his lotr 3 hours is good rule ill never know but the storytelling is great and no other version of the film makes us feel as much compassion for the titular ape as this one does yes the action scenes are absurd but so was the original back in 33 actuallyso is the idea in general so its very easy to forgive the special effects still hold up even today and likely will continue to do so also andy serkis shows us again that he is the king pun intended of mocap acting
Oct 26 2013,positive,i know this movie is long but i would still recommend this movie it has great action sequences good special effects and good performances
Oct 26 2013,positive,to me it was boring and creepy whenever the main chick and the monkey looked at each other lovingly i will say everyone acted wonderfully and the special effects are amazing
Oct 25 2013,positive,although i thought the dialogue was contrived at times with jack blacks performance this peter jackson remake is at least slightly more emotionally invested than what the 1933 version offered within the human characters the visual effects are notably as entirely mindblowing throughout for this modern era in cinema as the 33 one was for its era but this time with intense photorealism on not just the giant gorilla and dinos but also the insects and bats as a new addition what i wish to have seen in this version was the gorilla turning on its own tribal worshipers as the 33 one depicted plus the dead gorilla seen falling down from the empire state from a far away camera angle instead of a close topdown view
Oct 22 2013,positive,while the 1st hour stinks the rest delivers heartpounding action and eyepopping visuals
Oct 20 2013,positive,yeah the action is spectacular but what sold me even more than that was the strong character development and immersive dialogue that made king kong a film with tremendous brain as well as heart jack black and naomi watts are great easy recommendation
Oct 20 2013,positive,though way longer than it needed to be peter jacksons kong delivers in every aspect that it should have
Oct 17 2013,positive,dad   83  i took ethan when he was six mom was out of town and it was our secret for a long time
Oct 9 2013,neutral,decent remake  watch the original instead
Oct 8 2013,positive,great cinema new york was so beautifully portrayed during winter season of course i was bawling at the end always sad to see mr kong being annihilated torturous just like watching godzilla being butchered as a little girl 
Oct 7 2013,positive,wow what an incredible movie  it has lots of action was intense and it had extremely awesome fight scenes  it is a three hour movie but it keeps you engaged the whole way  this is definitely a mustsee
Oct 6 2013,positive,meh it was quite boring
Oct 4 2013,positive,definitely the most underrated movie ive ever seen the special effects are impeccable
Sep 29 2013,positive,because i like to watch movie
Sep 29 2013,neutral,a bad movie with some good moments
Sep 27 2013,positive,exceptionally beautiful soft and aged photography set the mood well for this picture show  192030s styling and costume add to the actors panache as they head off on an old fashioned deep dark adventure story  have your insect spray handy nibbles frozen monkey brains
Sep 26 2013,positive,great tribute to the classic original
Sep 25 2013,positive,jackson is a favorite of mine so anything his hand is in is worth it
Sep 22 2013,positive,not as scary as the origin 1936 film its far better than the 1970s version and the performances by black  watts really make this worth viewing and buying
Sep 22 2013,positive,too long but very well made
Sep 20 2013,positive,stiring emotional and action packed peter jacksons king kong is a remake of the highest order where the special effects never overshadow the more human and simian aspects of the movie only the slower paced first half lets it down a little
Sep 20 2013,positive,very stunning visuals and the story is expanded the characters get more depth but the action sequences are squeezed together to make up for the first part of the movie this makes the action dull after a while also the cgi is often over the top and makes it kind of soulless
Sep 18 2013,positive,kind of a stupid movie in my opinion
Sep 14 2013,positive,a very great film with great cast and impressive effects but goes overlong and that makes it very boring to watch nevertheless it is an amazing picture but not as superior as the original 1933 version
Sep 13 2013,positive,my favorite remake the music by james newton howard is big and beautiful it was also great to see it take tribute to the original 1933 film 45 out of 5
Sep 11 2013,positive,was surprised how good this was was it was actually sweet and not what i expected at all worth a look
Sep 10 2013,positive,i really enjoyed this remake great effects we all know how it ends but its worth watching anyway
Sep 8 2013,negative,without question one of the worst insults to a movie audience ever spewed out of the gob of hollywood made by the clueless people who think we are stupid people who forgot that although audiences love fantasy we do not love poorly drawn computer scenery with laughably childish animation the acting dialog and the buildup to the island are watchable then mr jackson turns in one of the most disgustingly lame dinosaurgorilla cartoon mashups imaginable no you couldnt imagine it its just that bad poor naomi died a thousand times in the grip of kong but managed to keep her charm the scene with the charging brontosauri may go down in film history as the stupidest sequence ever filmed except that it wasnt filmed was it it was poorly generated and executed on a 20 monitor horrid ignorant trash
Sep 8 2013,positive,worthy of the word king in its title
Sep 5 2013,positive,a neat remake that perfectly captures the originals spirit
Sep 4 2013,positive,like this movie where king kong fought dinosaur  and when the people ran in the middle of a dinosaur heard and where king kong climes the building and destroyed plains and was killed
Aug 29 2013,positive,peter jackson has made a movie that  is amongst the best ive ever seen gripping drama some light comedy but still holds true to the original 1933  classic naomi watts gives a superb performance as ann darrow and jack black as carl denham and adrian brody as jack driscoll are simply wonderful as well the hero of the picture is andy serkis as lumpy the cook and as kong i never thought a 3 hour 7 minute movie could fly by but this picture belongs with the classics
Aug 28 2013,positive,i enjoyed it wasnt expecting much before hand that might have helped
Aug 27 2013,positive,i cant lie it did break my heart
Aug 26 2013,positive,it was beauty that killed the beast

Aug 24 2013,positive,probably one of the best movies ever made every one of the 3 hours was spectacular and every actor works up to the limits of their potential definitely peter jackson at his finest
Aug 21 2013,positive,in 1933 a giant gorilla captured the hearts of thousands in 2005 a giant length movie restored our love for king kong in a big budget monster romp
Aug 15 2013,positive,king kong is the best monster movie ive ever seen it has great special effects action sequences fairly good characters an ok romance and the saddest death seen of any monster movie peter jackson put his best effort into this thrilling remake of the 1933 classic
Aug 10 2013,positive,the special effects while fighting the dinosaurs were awesome once it got to the city got a bit long
Aug 8 2013,positive,amazing visuals since jurassic park and great acting peter jacksons best
Aug 6 2013,negative,peter jackson is great at making scenery but not at movies too long and too boring
Aug 6 2013,positive,peter jackson lord of the nerds has return to conquer the world of monster movies by rebooting one of the most famous king kong despite a slight overlong runtime king kong is a towering blockbuster with stunning visuals fantastic action composition fun performances an understanding sensibility of old school monster movie affection and another landmark work of performance by andy serkis

Jul 27 2013,positive,loved it takes a while to get to skull island but the triple trex fight is worth it visuals are awesome 
Jul 27 2013,positive,king kong is indeed the definition of a great film
Jul 26 2013,positive,another triumph from jackson i just loved it
Jul 24 2013,positive,a remake done right
Jul 22 2013,negative,it struck all the wrong cords in me watts performance was brilliant but the story failed to put her acting to best of use at the end of the movie i was just hoping humanity would never fall so low
Jul 20 2013,positive,meh i mean its actually a pretty good movie but i mean it can be pretty boring i have seen it twice and dont want to see it again
Jul 18 2013,positive,i never get tired of watching this movie eventhough the story accumulates 3hour of watching period this movie even gets better and better as you see it after a couple of times some long movie sequels just makes me drowsy and bored but this one is a big shot film well maybe because of its main characters overall it is a must see movie for me
Jul 15 2013,positive,this movie was good i realy liked it except for the ending i dont think kong should have died
Jul 14 2013,positive,i remember seeing this in theaters special effects were on point and it was almost an exact remake of the 1933 original great movie

Jul 5 2013,positive,i think this movie was spectacular amazing special effects great acting cool animatronics and chilling creatures of course this movie wasnt as classically great as the 1933 version but i think this film is certainly not a bad one and deserves more respect
Jul 3 2013,positive,amazing but too long each time i see this movie i find my self rooting for king kong to win
Jul 3 2013,neutral,kong never appears until the middle of the movie if the love scenes were eliminated and wed go right to the ship sailing to skull island then i wouldve liked it
Jul 2 2013,negative,had to turn it off after an hour
Jul 2 2013,positive,its very rare to see a reboot that is actually good but peter jacksons king kong is exactly like that sort of i like how its set in the 1930s just like the original one what makes this film strong is the visual design of king kong peter jackson once again did a great job of designing the kong with motion capture andy serkis does the motion capture of the kong and is it me or has he been motion capture actor in most of peter jacksons films like the lord of the rings franchises and the adventures of tintin i wonder what hes gonna do for his next film anyways the only problems with this film are the supporting actors i just dont care about those character i mean why is jack black in this movie anyways i understand how he acts as carl denham in the film but why him i just cant see it on the other hand naomi watts performance was really strong unlike the original when ann darrow is the usual women who screams and gets kidnapped all the time by the kong in conclusion king kong is a fine reboot but nothin to surpass the original
Jul 1 2013,positive,the effects for being 8 years old now are incredible
Jun 30 2013,positive,animated kong and over three hour run time makes this remake disappointing i mean the 70s one was better
Jun 29 2013,positive,the effects are the big quality here the storys a little boring but the hair raising sequences are worth a look

Jun 22 2013,positive,enjoyable and has heart
Jun 19 2013,positive,its a classic a brilliant classic
Jun 18 2013,positive,the first half of king kong is slow and some of the moments after it are ridiculous that dance in the ice but the movie comes packed with a very majestic feeling and with wonder all over the three hours not superior to the original but much better than other king kong movies
Jun 14 2013,positive,wow this movie just amazed me this movie was so good that i couldnt have gotten enough of it most people rate this movie bad because of the run time are you kidding me i sat through the extended edition with 20 more minutes of action character development and heart this movie left me in tears because of kongs unfair fate and the movies notorious endingbravo
Jun 14 2013,positive,i remember seeing this with my parents back in 2005 it opens up in the 1930s new york during the great depression the stars like jack black and the others are pretty good for the movie being three hours one hour is new york second is the island and the third is back to new york    the guy who played king kong was the guy who played golem meaning there was a real person behind the cgi and not just a picture or air theres a lot of talking in the movie and when they meet the islands natives they are nothing like the original as well as all the other wildlife and theres even a scene where theres a giant stampede i also like how they make king kong just a misunderstood creature instead of a mindless killing machine since thats kinda how most monster movies are as well as having a helpless damsel in distress who just screams a lot this version doesnt have a lady who just screams a lot and actually contributes a little to kong she even warms up to him after she does some skits    the original king kong i never saw but ive seen people parody it sometimes also the original king kong was peter jacksons inspiration to do movies when he was a boy i do have the original on dvd so i guess ill have to take a look at the movie too heard that was one of the first movies to try stop motion and that is a dying art    anyway give both the original and the peter jackson remake a watch and see what you think you like i liked the peter jackson one but it is pretty long and the audience sometimes lacks patience for long
Jun 13 2013,positive,jack black isnt stellar in this movie like he is in nacho libre but he does have some humor im real good at crappin the crappers
Jun 11 2013,positive,very very long but worth the watch
Jun 10 2013,positive,enjoyed it but just another remake
Jun 9 2013,positive,aww this is soo sad  i cried
Jun 8 2013,positive,one of the best remakes ive seenwellnext to the coen brothers true gritdo i even need to explain the storyeveryone is familiar with the storywhybecause its one of the most iconic films ever madewhen i heard that the director of the lord of the rings trilogy was behind the project i proudly got hypedas any other human being wouldthe film itself payed close attention to every detailthe setsprops and locations looked greatalong with a digital spitshine too make things look as real as possibleall the actors did fine jobs recreating the characters from the original filmwhat surprised me the most was jack black who did a rather serious rolehe was really good in his rolebut i think thats why audiences had a hard time with this filmlike audiences with the truman showthey could only see the comedian not the actorid even say he was one of the best parts of the filmand gave a somewhat powerful performancebut andy serkis is the reason the movie shinesnot his role as a member of the crewwhich i enjoyed too but andy as kong himselfhe was just fantasticpeople say they didnt like it because it was too longi always say the movie doesnt suck because its too longyou just dont like long moviescorrect me if im wrong im giving this 5 starsmy hat is off too mrjacksongood luck on the next two hobbit movies buddyi enjoyed the firstand i cant wait for the next two
Jun 7 2013,negative,not into monkeys or old films being redone too much  cool special effects
Jun 7 2013,positive,watched this on in hd so it kicked ass
Jun 7 2013,negative,saw it at the embassy theatre in wellington  the revamp looked great
Jun 6 2013,neutral,shouldve been titled jack black in jurassic park
Jun 5 2013,neutral,when i first saw this movie i liked it but every time i watch it after that i like it less and less no this has nothing to being a remake of the original king kong its the running time that gets to me a three hour movie with nothing happening to people doing stupid stuff to people being over the top to monsters being there for the sake of attacking them sure the original kong was this as well but it was made in the 1930s when movies were movies werent taken seriously as an higher art form unlike today    do i still like it yeah i do a bit im just going to rule this in the lowest level of okay
Jun 5 2013,neutral,its ok but dont ever need to see it again
Jun 5 2013,positive,if you can get past the overlong boat scenes this film is very good and underrated kong is portrayed more like a normal animal rather than a monster
Jun 4 2013,positive,i love this movie it does have a few flaws but its the only one that actually meets the original in terms of quality the other remakes are laughably bad i always love being pleasantly surprised when the a remake holds up to the original and this one doesnt it surpasses it sure the former was great for the time but times have changed and it needed an update this update was great
Jun 4 2013,positive,possibly the best remake film ive ever seen
Jun 3 2013,negative,special effects look good but makes me want to fall asleep about half way through

May 29 2013,positive,best movie ever without a doubt better than the original
May 28 2013,positive,jackson gave kong real personality and awe  so good it made my 10 year old son cry at the end
May 28 2013,positive,remakes have practically become a staple amongst filmmakers although it is not like this is a relatively new idea it has been around since the earliest decades of motion pictures but in recent years there has been an almost nauseating excess in this kind of thing in the 90s they were quite few the only example i can think of is the fly but then the new millennium was ushered in and with it came remakes for willy wonk and the chocolate factory the day the earth stood still invasion of the body snatchers a nightmare on elm street and a slew of others even so there is one example amongst these that stands out as a substantial update peter jacksons king kong    now the first thing that comes to most peoples minds when they hear the name peter jackson is the lord of the rings trilogy granted these are very good movies that i thoroughly enjoyed both in the theaters and on home video release but my vote for this directors best film goes to king kong much like his previous projects this one was grand in scale but with more of an emphasis on feeling and heart than spectacle even though there is plenty of that to behold    the film opens up with a stylistic sequence that excellently captures the feel of what anyone would imagine the 1930s felt like the quick shots of primates are a nice touch subsequently we get a formal introduction to the stories of both anne darrow and carl denham both of which are given more detail in comparison to the 1933 classic from here on everything proceeds in a manner similar to the original albeit with a stretched out first act a few new sequences and some liberties taken with the characters it is from the former that most peoples objections stem from unlike such projects as the fellowship of the ring where something new came around regularly to either amuse or shake the audience out of their seats the entire first act of king kong can come across as drawn out or bloated containing scenes that do not serve any real purpose even so i have come to appreciate it for serving as a testament that peter jackson intended to make the most of every moment he had to make this film when we see a scene of a young crew member interacting with the first mate or the lead actor first entering his lodgings it does not have to be there but brings the setting of the ship to life in a manner not attempted before i also agree with roger eberts identification of this approach as a means of making the first appearance of the monster more effective bringing me to my next point     it is well documented that jackson has a great respect for the 1933 king kong a sentiment that has motivated him to borrow elements from it without veering into imitation instead paying tribute to it after seeing king kong in theaters i was motivated to watch the original and after i did i could recall many examples of homage that jackson included in his film some of these fall under the category of dialogue lifted directly from the original but again this does not come across as plagiarism these lines while barely altered are generally used in a different context one of the better examples is the first reference to the existence of kong originally it was used by denham to inspire the belief of something worthwhile on the island here it is used as an ominous warning by the crew for what could possibly be on the island both versions work for different reasons    the character work is commendable in general with some new details that bring new life to the stories of some of the key players with anne darrow being the standout i will readily admit that a strong case can be made that jack black was miscast as the obsessive carl denham but i still feel that there are things to appreciate with this take on the character as opposed to robert armstrongs portrayal which was fittingly detached and single minded black manages to bring a sense of insecurity to the role which can be seen in many instances when his plans come crashing down there is a particularly effective example of this when he speaks to the audience during the display of kong and denham perceives the praise he has sought after for so long which makes the imminent events leave him all the more desolate again while i cannot say which is more effective both bring something to admire adrian brody however is far too subdued and stiff to be worth going into detail about     the key element of the film however is the relationship between anne darrow and kong himself which in my eyes is primarily what makes this iteration of the story different from previous ones the innovation of having anne reciprocate the feelings of care that kong feels was first seen in the 1976 remake but portrayed in such a silly manner as to evoke nothing beyond amusement jackson probably detested that movie because he saw the potential with this new approach in essence making his own the rectification of a mistake here this element is refined significantly making for a very dynamic relationship that has an impressive degree of depth and poetry both of the characters are crucial to making this work  kong himself is a remarkable visual achievement able to express a wide range of emotions and much like the 1933 incarnation feeling more human than the actual human cast thanks to the time devoted to have anne understand kong there are new insights given into the monster that are not seen in either of the other film versions for example as roger ebert pointed out in the final act after witnessing the behavior of other people kong shows he intends to protect anne from the rest of her species and later at the top of the empire state building as the two of them witness the sunrise he halfheartedly begins to beat his chest in an expression of dominance that calls back to earlier moments perhaps to retain her confidence maybe he knew what was coming there is even a nice throwaway detail within the middle act as kong is carrying anne to the top of the waterfall we briefly see what appear to be the skeletal remains of another kong this is a reminder that kong is the last of his kind and that loneliness is a big burden he carries     naomi watts gives an exceptional performance as anne made all the more impressive by the fact that most of the time she had to interact with thin air showing that given the right direction it is possible to be convincing even if you have only your imagination to go off of this is one of the few elements in which the remake outclasses the original she too conveys a wide range of emotions and even manages to bring a sense of strength and steadfastness that was not present in the character before an excellent example of this is when she first uses her performance skills to entertain kong which is essentially the first step in the evolution of the emotional focus very much in the spirit of the classic tale beauty and the beast she goes from being terrified to being able to glimpse the humanity in this creature something that nobody else in the movie sees every time i watch this movie it surprises me how emotionally invested i am in this    the visuals as can be expected are top notch and possess the same sense of majesty that is found in the lord of the rings trilogy even though both styles are noticeably different the two scenes of anne and kong admiring the sun on the horizon are fine examples of the beauty aspired to here just as impressive is the soundtrack which i believe perfectly complements and bolsters the action particularly during the climax and just before the closing credits this makes for a finale that packs quite a wallop    while it is not quite the achievement that the 1933 king kong was peter jacksons take on the timeless tale is a wonderful movie experience that ultimately helps you appreciate the original even more that is what i believe makes it a successful remake it reinvents the original while honoring and celebrating it
May 27 2013,positive,really good very good direction
May 27 2013,positive,soo cute ends to sad tho
May 26 2013,positive,unlike the 1976 version the 2005 king kong is right on par with the 1933 film  peter jackson makes a very long but superb version of a classic  the story is faithful to the 33 film but manages to take new directions that are very good  the acting here is much better and the characters are much more enjoyable  the writing and direction is good but still has some of jacksons flawed moments but manage not to detract from the film  the 2005 king kong is at par with the 33 and even a tad bit better the emotions and storylines here are very well done by everyone involved and make this a truly great film
May 24 2013,positive,too much buildup story  the romance was also very shallow
May 23 2013,neutral,visually spectacular with stylish special effects but over long with too many climaxes and fairly average characters
May 22 2013,positive,a truimph of modern film and deserving of classic status peter jackson is the king kong of special effects he knows perfectly well when the special effects begin to drown out the substance of the picture his films are beautiful to look at entertaining to watch emotionally gripping and narritively spellbinding jackson is one of the few great blockbuster directors and king kong may very well turn out to be his magnum opus
May 22 2013,positive,some big cgi mistakes in this one but a good effort
May 21 2013,positive,one of the most devotedtotheoriginal films ever made it is an extremely tiring film to keep up with but done extremely well

May 2 2013,positive,loved it  especially the extended edition
May 1 2013,positive,mmm not what i was expecting not a bad remake but just not my kind of movie
May 1 2013,positive,one of peter jacksons most underrated and misunderstood movies this is the definitive version of kong in my eyes as it is one of those movies that blew me away in the theaters and inspired my imagination in cinema     this is not as short and fastpaced as the timeless stopmotion classic jacksons control on content is overindulgent to some extent  but it is emotionally rich terrificallyacted handsomely directed features tremendously exciting action and it looks spectacular as an actionadventure epic should     while some of the visuals will not quite hold up there is no denying jacksons sheer filmmaking prowess the powerful performance that andy serkis puts behind kongs eyes and naomi watts breathtaking starmaking turn as ann darrow  910 a
May 1 2013,negative,it wasnt good and too long
May 1 2013,negative,fell asleep in first 30min
May 1 2013,positive,very good and superb effects
May 1 2013,positive,the movie was fabulous but the ending was so sad
Apr 29 2013,positive,oh king kong besides saying that this is the best remake ever made its just a masterpiece people have criticised it for being so long but that just enhances it 45 of the movie is on the island and 15 is in new york and the new york part is one amazing finale    jack black plays his part extremely well and his finale lines are just beautiful adrien brody also plays his part greatly he feels right for this role naomi watts plays her part good too especially when kong gets captured from that moment she just takes it away     the effects for the dinosaurs some scenery and of course kong is just perfect kong especially kong feels real with emotion and all his fighting scenes are epicly action packed and his capture was sadly beautiful his finale just feels epic and the ending to this amazing epic is just mesmerising     overall noone could of done better at this than peter jackson the sets are awesome the effects are perfect and the cast are great his remake is one epic film and one of the best movies ever made epic
Apr 28 2013,negative,ok if ya like overgrown monkeys

Apr 27 2013,positive,king kong brings everything to the table a great movie
Apr 27 2013,positive,i have been a fan of this story since i watched the original 1933 version as a young child it has been redone so many times over the years and this was the same story i felt it was very well done but not much less is to be expected from peter jackson the cgi was great adrian brody did a good job jack black with a surprisingly good dramatic performance overall a spectacular adaptation of beauty and the beast only flaw in my eyes it was just past the point of being quite lengthy great film though certainly worth the watch and the own
Apr 26 2013,positive,i saw this one when it first came outwe also own this one
Apr 26 2013,positive,twice as long as the original and really drawn out
Apr 24 2013,positive,great effects not bad
Apr 22 2013,negative,the film begins as a comedy with a frank joe jack black or whatever his name is preserving some flashes of his usual hilarity then evolving into some kind of heart of darkness after all explicitly quoted in the movie slowly building up a mysterious tension until an island docking vaguely tasting of arthur gordon pym    so far so good     from the sacrifice on and since the appearance of the star it starts a vertiginous quality slope you find yourself stuck in one of those modern cinematic nightmare in which they have enrolled an equipe of playstation programmers to shoot the movie which swings toward a mediocre jurassic park technically a bit bad with monsters and humans not so well amalgamated running on different perspective planes as if it was a computer era update of those old mythological movies made out of play dough or of those automobile sequences of old in which the road and the landscape were visibly projected around the car while the suspension of disbelief requests are becoming increasingly exorbitant and untenable    the ease of computer graphics often leads to indulge into useless redundancy in attempts to obtain some effects on the viewer merely through the tactic of accumulation of weird beasts various giant things and generally reveling on the look at that we can do whatever we want  isnt that wonderful concept listen no its not     on one side because these things require moderation and calibration on the other side because computer graphics often give an alienating feeling of volatility inconsistency and cold unreality are we in a cinematic surreality or in a playstation videogame     the most frightening creature that youre going to see in the whole movie is ultimately adrien brodys nose     almost the totality of the second part unwinds through a mass of worthless and exasperating action sequences frank joe black i really cant remember his exact name plays the role of a cynic self serving egotistical character which  in the second half  is practically a totally monofaced guy grim gaze focused on something or lost into nothing naomi watts makes a fool of herself playing the part of a perverted zoophiliac falling in love with a 26 feet tall gorilla and then they tell you that size doesnt matter its a pity that there arent explicit scenes    adrien brody in turn is a feebleminded idiot fallen in love with a girl since half an hour but already ready to give all of his blood for her furthermore hes a writer of mediocre playlets which poses as a superhero in his free time    the movie starts out okay and then becomes silly and longwinded factually a huge waste of money and all this while the children of biafra are still without a playstation

Apr 3 2013,neutral,my favorite is still the 1970s version with jessica lange
Apr 2 2013,positive,for the novice and unfamiliar the plot may seem too thin but for those acquainted with the bw kong this graphically beautiful masterpiece is every bit the film the original was quite literally because beginning with the crews venture of skull island all the action sequences have been enhanced and replicated frametoframe the visual effects are superb and in itself worth the watch
Apr 2 2013,positive,one long movie that takes awhile to get to the good stuff eh
Apr 2 2013,negative,a good film but i felt it dragged on and on the storyline doesnt get interesting until neaerer the end which is disappointing its worth a watch but its not a film id watch more than twice a year

Mar 28 2013,positive,peter jackson proved once again to the world that he is one of the greatest directors this generation this is truly a masterpiece which manages to surpass the original in every way the main characters are well developed and likable thanks to some great performances by naomi watts andrien brody and ofcourse the star of the film king kong king kongs expressions and body language is so well done you will have a hard time holding back your tears the screenplay florishes from start to finish and that is very prominent in the emotional and beautiful scenes with kong and ann there are also a ton of breathtaking action sequences you would expect from such a powerhouse of a blockbuster everything about this movie is so expertly crafted and wellpaced peter and everyone involved did an amazing job simply put a masterpiece
Mar 27 2013,positive,great movie especially when he fights the two trexs

Mar 22 2013,positive,an exciting and visually stunning remake that when compared to its predecessors stands as a testament to the innovations of film and cinema
Mar 22 2013,positive,takes a while to get going but very well done kong looks amazing
Mar 21 2013,positive,they did a good job with this one
Mar 21 2013,positive,peter jacksons king kong remake spends a needless amount of time getting to know the supporting cast so well supposedly care about them as they get murdered in creative ways but it ultimately doesnt mean a single thing the surviving crew totally disappears once the third act hits making much of the journey feel like a real waste the action sequences are also indulgent to the point of tedium each losing any sense of peril or dramatic stakes after a few minutes regardless theres some truly spectacular use of miniatures a great amount of care poured into every aspect of art design and the central four cast members serkis watts brody black are also quite good this was clearly a labor of love for jackson and could have been a nearmasterpiece with a massive reedit
Mar 20 2013,neutral,confused concept  effects in the way
Mar 20 2013,positive,a powerful movie with a noce ending
Mar 19 2013,negative,i hated this movie i could barely stay awake to see it boring is what i thought

Mar 18 2013,positive,third favorite movie
Mar 18 2013,positive,overarated overhyped and way too long but still entertaining
Mar 18 2013,positive,the kong  is ultimately a king in this movie in 1933 the classic blackandwhite movie king kong beloved and wellcriticized reached us years have passed and hollywood has given us terrible king kong movies simply to make money in 2005 peter jackson one of the best directors in the business takes this franchise and promissed to renew it and he kept his promise yes and very well  the peter jacksons king kong broke all expectations not only is very faithful to the king kong of 1933 but with superb visuals and a fantastic performance naomi watts is excellent adrien brody as always fantastic and jack black it was a surprise a comedy actor gives us a simply superb performance but makes you laugh in some parts of the film and andy serkis as kong  fantastic  a film that spends 3 hours without realizing it full of action adventure horror romance drama with stunning visuals effects and a fantastic and touching story and it is also in my opinion the best remake ever made
Mar 18 2013,negative,it was alright but the original is better and a little campy which i like
Mar 18 2013,positive,movee took way 2 long

Mar 15 2013,positive,movie of the year 2005
Mar 15 2013,negative,story line was ok but the movie was to generic bad graphics
Mar 14 2013,positive,ok lets take a look at what is on display hereenormous amounts of cgi that actually is beautiful to look at some good and unexpected performances particularly black and an extremely long movie that feels like an extremely long movie dont get me wrong i love long movies but there were some pacing issues and some scenes that just didnt belong in a film like this its an enjoyable film but its not for everyone
Mar 13 2013,positive,it was preatty good but i got board in some parts
Mar 12 2013,positive,not an all the time want to see movie
Mar 11 2013,positive,epic and faithful to the original king kong but the unnecessarily long running time over 3 hours does put a noticeable damper on the process wonderful special effects and a well chosen cast

Mar 8 2013,positive,off da chains must watch movie
Mar 8 2013,positive,overlong but jacksons recreation of the original is fantastic great cast and some fantastic eye candy
Mar 7 2013,positive,filmmaker carl denham jack black wants to make a movie at the mythical skull island but the studio wont fund the project so with stolen movie equipment denham plans to make the film no matter what however his leading actress pulled out and he must find another who will brave the journey     enter ann darow naomi watts an attractive struggling stage actressdancer who just lost a job she agrees to go with denham who tells her that they are going to singapore and they head to the docks where studio officials and police show up to arrest the director     on the ship darrow meets the tough crew arrogant actor bruce baxter kyle chandler who is a gentleman to darrow and playwright jack driscoll adrien brody whom darrow is anxious to work with     eventually the island which is known as skull island is found and much of the ships crew denham and his cast go ashore where they find freaky looking natives and the largest manmade wall theyve ever seen     the natives who look peaceful at first then attack their visitors and take darrow into custody they then offer the blond beauty to their god  a 25 foot tall silverback gorilla andy serkis whose movements were recorded for reference to animate the cgi gorilla who becomes smitten with the actress     as darrow warms up to the giant gorilla a rescue partyfilm crew goes into the dense jungle where enormous animals including dinosaurs live many of the men are killed by the animals and the gorilla but darrow is saved but denham who wants to make money wants to bring back the gorilla to new york city to make a buck     and so the gorilla is brought back to the big apple where a modified story of his capture is told as he is presented on a broadway stage however the wild animal escapes when it discovers that for the stage show darrow was replaced by a lookalike julia walshaw and it eventually makes its way to the empire state building to make its famed climb to the top of the skyscraper     the first thing you will notice while watching this film is that there are some incredible cgi special effects and incredible cinematography i would strongly suggest that you find a widescreen edition on dvd because the fullscreen just doesnt do the movie justice     not all of the cgi effects in the film especially when the human cast is in the scene and they are surrounded by cgi you can easily tell that they are in front of a blue or green screen and added into the scene during postproduction     there are some good performances in this film in my opinion out of the entire main cast blacks performance is one of the weaker performances sometimes his performance works while at other times he just didnt appear to make much of an effort also brody was just wrong for the romantic leading male in this film his performance was pretty good but there are better leading men who are a lot better looking who could have worked much better in this role     one huge thing that was a major problem in the movie is that it is over threehours long because of the movies length many scenes are drawnout and lags frequently one thing that should have been cut down is the time the movie spends on the search for darrow in kongs jungle i was was wishing for the movie to go forward to nyc and skip the capture of the gorilla     one thing that fans of the 1933 king kong will love is that there are references to that version throughout the film peter jackson who directed this remake also used props from the 1933 version that he has personally collected over the years one scene fans of the original 1933 version will love is that denham films baxter and darrow acting out a scene from the original film wordforword there is even a direct reference to fay wray the original darrow merian c cooper who cowrote the original king kong and rko studios which released the original 1933 movie     despite the flaws this version of king kong is really good with good performances amazing special effects and way too many references to the original 1933 movie is fun to watch i personally wish it was at least 40 minutes shorter or even 100 minutes which is the approximate run time of the original film
Mar 5 2013,positive,jack black is awsome

Feb 21 2013,positive,good movie but i like movies that are in the same time frame
Feb 21 2013,positive,excellent story beautiful effects everything about it is amazing 5 stars perfect
Feb 21 2013,positive,much of the opening hour is unnecessary but peter jacksons king kong features some incredible action scenes especially kong vs the tyrannosaurs and is the remake that the 1933 original deserves
Feb 21 2013,positive,good but really want to know what the creator was smoking when he came up with the idea for this film
Feb 20 2013,neutral,not a lot of dialougesp
Feb 20 2013,negative,to good for a retro story
Feb 19 2013,positive,its biggest downfall is its running time with some of the charactersstorylines feeling a bit unnecessary but peter jacksons king kong is chalk full of great visual effects tons of action and a surprisingly moving love story its hard to find it highly entertaining and enjoyable on most levels

Feb 14 2013,negative,i liked the classic better
Feb 13 2013,positive,some people moaned its too long it takes an hour before you actually see kong but fuck them its all in the build up fans would know that the 1933 version of this film is jacksons favorite film ever he has had a love for kong that has spanned the years he finally gets his chance to remake it and what he has done is take the essential ingredients that make the original amazing and simply add to them he gives the characters more rounded structures and shows sides to them previously unseen kong looks amazing and naomi watts gives a fantastic performance as the heroine that kong falls for the scenes between the two of them are both enthralling yet heart breaking masterful cinema at its most bold you have to be bold to remake a classic that was already fucked up once the jeff bridges 70s monkey suit shit anyone the extended version that clocks in at 3 hours plus is the version to watch
Feb 13 2013,positive,peter jacksons king kong is not a great movie but is a really entertaining tribute to the original if you can sit through the overly long beginning unlike the original which introduces characters quickly and steamrolls to skull island so as to meet up with the title character this movie takes way too much time introducing us to the slightly fanatical filmmaker carl denham jack black and the down and out vaudevillian performer ann darrow naomi watts once the movie gets to skull island thats when it picks up steam the special effects and action are top notch and the scenes with kong and ann are touching as it comes to its tragic conclusion truly a better film than the 1976 dino de laurentiis travesty but not surpassing the original by any means
Feb 13 2013,neutral,it was slow at times but still it was a decent movie

Jan 9 2013,positive,a masterpiece director peter jackson has created a film that has finally done a good job on reenvisioning the 1933 classic and in some ways it is far better than the original it made me genuinely feel for the characters so that by the time kong is killed we are invested into the character that we actually are saddened by his death which is exactly what it was intended this is by far one of the greatest films of all time it deserves a place with the greats along side the original
Jan 9 2013,neutral,i expected the big blowout by peter jackson but it took too long to get to kong i think hes used to giving 3hour movies so he had to fill in some gaps in this movie i love lord of the rings dont get me wrong everything was interesting its just in this onehe couldve done more

Jan 7 2013,positive,yes the film is a tad too long but that doesnt mean it derailed the movie    therefore i must say king kong is an emotional thrilling heartbreaking ride that shines thanks to its special effects and direction
Jan 7 2013,positive,not as good as the original but still very good
Jan 7 2013,positive,the epicness is great but the long drawnout storyline drags you along for an entertaining but long journey which leads you to afarfetchedclimax the gorilla loves the lady so beauty and the beast  thats the theme of the long movie wait no its jack black getting his movie and his millions at any cost  thats the theme wait its the lies and the deception and the difficulties of showbiz  thats it wait mute black people screaming on a mysteriously unfindable island and worshiping a giant gorilla king who wants tonot eat the blonde the theme of the movie is that the movie doesnt know what the movies about but its undeniably entertaining
Jan 7 2013,positive,long movie boring at timesbut loved it

Jan 6 2013,positive,i like this but love the 1930 production better
Jan 6 2013,positive,after the huge critical and commercial success of the lord of the rings trilogy peter jackson surely mustâtmve been thinking what next  well the answer to that is to do a remake of 1933 classic king kong the single film that inspired jackson to become a film director  a master class in cgi and motion capture king kong 2005 tells the story of a film producer in search of a good film only to stumble across a giant gorilla called king kong capture him and take him to new york            peter jackson clearly loves an epic and immensely long film and this film doesnâtmt change anything because from the opening shots of 30âtms new york to the emotional ending king kong notches up a length of roughly three hours  so this film is long almost as long as adrien brodyâtms nose and this review and it is epic  the film is so long because peter jackson seems to stuff piles of rather irrelevant content into this film causing splatters of boredom dotted around the film and a satisfactory feeling when the film finally ends             in my opinion i felt that there was a lack of clear storyline however that is forgotten when youâtmre introduced to the large periods of highoctane action with some epic chases and some even more epic fights in particular a truly heartpounding action sequence involving romping and chomping flipping and kicking head locks a sweet dose of serious asskicking three trexes and one giant gorilla  whatâtms not to love             for me king kongâtms performance is vital to making this film a success and clearly i felt the same as peter jackson as he reunites with andy serkis aka gollum from lotr picked to portray the abominable king kong thanks to marvellous cgi and motion capture  andy serkis does not let you down bringing emotion intelligence passion and most of all some wonderfully crafted apelike characteristics to the table             king kong also boasts some surprisingly marvellous performances first and foremost jack black who taking a break from his natural habitat comedy eclipses previous outings into seriousness as carl denham a character who transforms from an angry producer keen to prove his critics wrong to a man who obsesses over his film and shortly begins to lose his moral compass doing anything for success even capture an 8m tall gorilla and take him to new york  other actors who shine are jamie bell as jimmy a kleptomaniac found abandoned on venture the boat they go to skull island on thomas kretschmann as captain engelhorn and evan parke as ben hayes            finally there are the marvels of the computergenerated island of skull island  it is magnificent  jackson and co have created a truly magical and mystical world ridden with giant insects and dinosaurs yeah thatâtms right dinosaurs  95 of the action in the film takes place on the island with the orklike natives on the island attacking carl and his crew in a scene that is both heartpounding and strangely interesting to watch and the many fights and chases on the island  also as the home of two thirds of the film skull island had to be perfect  and it was  they have created a place that is shrouded in both fog and mystery and littered with strange and nicely crafted creatures and some truly magical landscapes              this film is a wonderful example of filmmaking  peter jackson has made another film that while being over three hours long is also enthralling highoctane and surprisingly heartwarming  yes it is long yes the plot is rather simplistic but this film is a success down to the wonderful creation of skull island and a magical performance from andy serkis as king kong
Jan 5 2013,positive,classy retelling of the giant monkey breaks stuff movie also peter jacksons  trademarks are all over this

Jan 3 2013,negative,the original was older but better and it was too long

Jan 1 2013,positive,i forget if i liked this or not but whatever 4
Jan 1 2013,negative,didnt really like it
Jan 1 2013,positive,drones for what feels like hours and sets up multiple characters we barely feel anything for and are ditched almost entirely when the title character finally appears theres some absolutely flawed circumstances in this adventure epic such as utahraptors or whatever they are fixating obsessively on the human sidecharacters running away from a stampede of hundreds of tonnes of herbivore dinosaurs and when king kong protects his love interest from rampaging rexes who are deadset on chowing down on her they dont reconsider a bigger meal in king kong instead last but not least theres a bit too much emotional manipulation going on in this film that last point however presents a strength at the same time you feel something for the title character who is catapulted into a world in which he does not have a chance against his will and he gets destroyed trying to not only get to grips with his new surroundings but protect the one whom hes set his eyes on
Jan 1 2013,positive,long movie same story as original but still a good one

Dec 15 2012,positive,best 2oth bday present
Dec 15 2012,negative,of all peter jackson movies i have seen this was my least favorite  frankly thats not really his fault  king kong is just stupid altogether  jackson does as well with it as he could have  jack black was perfect naomi watts is pretty good and cute might i add and adrian brody is still one of the more underrated actors in hollywood only the acting and peter jacksons incredible cinematography make this a film worth watching once
Dec 15 2012,neutral,long and jack black tries to be serious
Dec 14 2012,positive,great visually but a bit slow at times
Dec 14 2012,positive,this movie is fantstic beautifully shot with amazing special effects the emotion and action it mixes is so great with great acting from the majority of the cast my only critisisms are that it is over long possibly a little too much taking place in ny at the beginning but not by much peter jackson shows us an almost exact replica of nyc in that time once on the island it is pure action after action and it doesnt slow down one bit  another critism is jack black although perfect for the role its extremly hard to take him seriously when ever he talks he sounds so sarcastic and bored with himself most of the time  other than that great movie
Dec 14 2012,negative,king kong is one of those movies that have a very simple but boring story but with great special effects but you cannot enjoy a movie without really knowing the story the dialogue is cheesy and kid  like the characters are all horrible especially king kong all these important things are negative resulting in a bad movie i did not like it i thought it was silly peter jackson should have been making a different movie the amount of time this movie is and how bad it is really wastes your time
Dec 14 2012,positive,i liked it forgot half of it but it was good
Dec 13 2012,negative,really how did critics like this movie its a 3 hour movie that is about a gorilla who falls in love with a human oh yeah and the gorilla is like 100 feet tall seriosly at least king kong didnt put his giant banana in her split if that happened i would be afraid of gorillas for the rest of my life
Dec 13 2012,positive,havnt seen all of it but it looks really good and very interesting i love it
Dec 12 2012,positive,king kong triumphs  it has special effects so real you forget theyre computer generated brilliant acting and a great style that truly captures the sense of jungle adventure as well as new york 30s
Dec 12 2012,neutral,big animated ape falls for a mediocre actress the coolest part of the movie is when the leeches come out and eat people heads off other than that it is sad to see when an animated ape acts better than a naomi watts
Dec 11 2012,positive,this is another one of my all time favorite movies i love every minute ofthis movie
Dec 11 2012,positive,could have been better

Dec 8 2012,positive,this movie has it all action adventure a love never meant to be and truly amazing visual effects i highly recommend this one
Dec 7 2012,negative,misstep  jackson would have been better off even setting it in present times as opposed to trying to reinvent the original while sticking so closely to the originals incidental story elements and especially its aesthetics albeit colorized
Dec 7 2012,positive,i dont care what any of my friends say i love this movie it is visually arresting and  icredibly entertaining even if they did take a little too long to get to the island this is one of my favorites the score is beautiful and really tells the story well
Dec 7 2012,positive,very good becauseit is all actiom
Dec 7 2012,neutral,she fell in love with a monkey a monkey does anyone realize that

Dec 6 2012,positive,great movie  too long
Dec 6 2012,positive,it was okay not that great though it could have been better

Dec 4 2012,positive,who knew i could feel bad for a cgi gorilla
Dec 4 2012,positive,a feast for the eyes for those who enjoy welldone cgi peter jackson adds enough of his own spin to the movie to not make this remake a tribute but also his own wonderful performance by jack black
Dec 4 2012,negative,i dislike this movie so much its just not my style i suppose to boring and uninteresting for me
Dec 4 2012,negative,i thought this movie really sucked

Nov 30 2012,negative,not much talking just action
Nov 29 2012,positive,jack black made this movie lol
Nov 29 2012,neutral,good movie  very well done  but its still not one of the best on my list
Nov 28 2012,positive,its overlong and has unnecessary scenes but i still think its an enjoyable film yes i think at least forty minutes could have been cut out but the action scenes are riveting and the ending is emotional so i recommend it
Nov 27 2012,negative,rather long not super great pretty cool effects but too slow in much of the movie
Nov 27 2012,negative,all special effects  the original and the remake of the original shits all over it
Nov 27 2012,positive,great movie more people should have seen it
Nov 26 2012,positive,a film i found to be incredibly enjoyable the scenes i didnt like were surprisingly only included in the directors cut if i see the theatrical cut i am apt to liking it even more the production values are topshelf and the acting is perfectly acceptable but it is jacksons kong that makes the film a winner he is a truly captivating character despite not being human a true challenge for any director i also adored the new zealand scenery of which there couldve been a bit more time devoted to    there were some scenes that were hard to sit through particularly the natives scene and of course the iconic sacrificialattempt scene i guess i may be soft but these scenes were beyond creepy and of course the excess killings and gore didnt help much either and what was with dropping the scene from the trailer where ann screams on the shore of the island while filming a scene for carls film i thought this was a great invite into the mysteries of the island and a perfect way of introducing the beast that is kong    the film is too long the scene where kong is looking into anns eyes while on top of the empire state building went far too long and was emotionally excessive    all in all a great film that i wouldnt mind watching the theatrical cut sometime soon
Nov 26 2012,positive,only saw it once but i thought it was good
Nov 26 2012,negative,tired of remakes but good graphics
Nov 25 2012,positive,i did not really like it until i saw it on blu ray

Nov 25 2012,positive,a visual spectacle a true achievement in motion capture
Nov 24 2012,positive,as someone who has never seen the original 33 version i find this movie to be incredible and find all the hate towards it bewildering  id like to preface this review by saying that if youre the kind of person that struggles to keep attention past the 90 minute mark and thinks that anything longer than 2 hours is too long and therefore boring this movie is not for you as it is at least 3 hrs long depending on which cut youre watching  if instead you dont have the attention span of a 6 year old you should give this movie a shot  this movie is greatly entertaining sad tragic romantic action packed funny and thrilling throughout its entirety it always has something interesting and gripping going on in addition it features a great cast that delivers a great performance especially when taking into consideration the extent to which cgi was used in this picture furthermore it is enhanced by an amazing score and beautiful visuals   i guess you could complain about the lack of verisimilitude in the action scenes people not dying as much as they ought to but i can get past that and find them all to be lots of fun  finally for those of you who are very attached to the original if you watch this trying to compare the two movies in the words of thumper the skiing instructor youre gonna have a bad time
Nov 24 2012,negative,why was the island called skull island i never got that connection p

Nov 23 2012,positive,the performances are spoton and the visual effects are incredible the only flaw in king kong is its excessive length but other than that its almost perfect
Nov 23 2012,positive,it quite a good remake to the original its just that its over 3 hours long
Nov 22 2012,positive,the length may be a little excessive but when you have characters this interesting and a story this captivating it means nothing particularly when the character of kong has this much depth and is this enthralling making the end just as tragic as any even when you know its coming from the start
Nov 22 2012,positive,i liked it there were some gross parts
Nov 22 2012,positive,great watching him rip apart the trex jaw
Nov 21 2012,negative,seriously jack black

Nov 15 2012,negative,i dont think peter jackson made this movie to cash in on it he loved the original since he was a child and wanted to update it for a modern age while i dont think that excuses how poor this movie was i can see why he even gave it a go

Nov 8 2012,positive,it was oki like the part when she is dancing for kong and he has an attitudeso funny
Nov 8 2012,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a truly spectacular film jackson tells a 100year old story and makes it feel fresh everything about this film is epic i was one of the few people who didnt enjoy the lord of the rings trilogy but i thoroughly enjoyed jacksons take on the legend of king kong jack black delivers a surprisingly strong performance as carl denham the director of a potential movie to be filmed on an uncharted island naomi watts one of the greatest actresses to have ever lived portrays an out of work actress named ann darrow adrien brody plays a young writer named jack driscoll who has been hired to write the screenplay by denham the story is very wellknown so i wont waste your time with the details the scope of the film is extraordinary and jacksons craftsmanship is masterful peter jacksons king kong is a perfect example of how cgi can enhance the viewing experience and the depth of the story the film made me excited to see peter jacksons next cinematic vision
Nov 8 2012,positive,peter jackson is a genuis
Nov 8 2012,positive,good movie specially the second half
Nov 8 2012,positive,why do they torture the monkey we evolved from monkeys it is like torturing yourself
Nov 8 2012,positive,peter jackson is at his best here groundbreaking visuals and strong performances with a fine script that brings this old story into the modern world of film what limits king kong however is its excessive length and the graphic nature of its violence for a 12 certificate

Nov 4 2012,neutral,it was okay nothing like the original however its almost far fetched overall its olay but not great
Nov 4 2012,positive,visually i loved this but jackson should have put as much effort into the rest of the film as he did the asthetic
Nov 4 2012,positive,visually spectacular and emotionally resonant peter jacksons king kong is a fantastic film featuring intense edgeofyourseat action an excellent cast with the likes of adrien brody naomi watts and jack black at their best and visual effects that only epic films such as james camerons avatar or the lord of the rings trilogy could compete with both weta digital  the effects company jackson used for both this film and the lord of the rings trilogy  and andy serkis who does a stunning job bringing kong to life using motion capture did an incredible job with the creation of king kong whose scenegrabbing prescense is clear from the first time we see the 25foot gorilla king kong will go down as one of jacksons best alongside the lord of the rings trilogy

Oct 19 2012,positive,good but not great  that bug scene was awesome
Oct 18 2012,positive,enormous in its excess and rnning time much of the movie runs suspension of disbelief thin here anne is carried in kongs fists even when hes sprinting on all fours vrexes battle over anne when they should be preoccupied with survival   its a litany really  still the filmmakers certainly approached this movie with affection and that affection translates well to the audience  it is stunning and kongs grandeur has never been greater
Oct 18 2012,positive,loved this movie
Oct 18 2012,positive,worth the watch dont fall asleep
Oct 18 2012,positive,too long abit boring
Oct 17 2012,neutral,long but interesting
Oct 17 2012,positive,kong is a masterpiece of motion capture and peter jackson does an okay job in remaking the story
Oct 16 2012,positive,i love jack black and thought this was fun flick the way they redid the story was for the better from the 70s in my opinion naomi held up well and brody was good too
Oct 16 2012,positive,holy crap i loved it
Oct 15 2012,positive,there are several scenes in this film that shatter my suspension of disbelief due to the overuse of cgi and some poor greenscreening tactics it can also become overly sentimental at times and be unnecessarily corny still king kong is a dazzling adventure into the unknown this being skull island and is a generally satisfying moviegoing experience despite the inevitably tragic conclusion
Oct 15 2012,positive,the movie was a little too long
Oct 14 2012,positive,great action in this movie

Oct 6 2012,positive,definitely one of the greatest adventure movies ever created i still dont know why this wasnt in 3d the performances were absolutely amazing the effects were phenomenal and the story was bullet proof all the way one more thing to add i do not care what people say this length was alright for me just imagine this an hour shorter it wouldnt make any sense

Oct 1 2012,positive,poor ape but he makes some quite fabulous entertainment
Sep 30 2012,positive,at over 3 hours long this epic fantasy adventure film remakes not only a classic film but the style of the golden era of hollywood cinema peter jackson is one of many film makers of his generation including  spielberg carpenter scorsese etc that pays homage and remakes classic hollywood films at once highly melodramatic which is the style with a nonsensical thin plot it is full of long action sequences with cgi that arent that impressive the exception to this is of course the effects of kong himself which are excellent perhaps due to the impressive digital effect techniques developed for rings 20012003 and the body performance by andy serkisthe performances are good with what they had to work with following the genre style they lack much character development although thankfully there is not that much exposition and jackson handles the conveying of emotion and communication beautifully through imagery as film making should be and thats what makes him a great director the film is overly long and the plot is highly unrealistic of course but if you can get past the major illogical plot holes and fantastical elements it is quite enjoyable naomi watts gives a great performance lifting her character up from what may have been purely the hysterical woman who screams instead giving a gritty emotional and funny performance that feels real although of course she does scream a lot naomi watts and adrien brody are the stand out performances and jack black gives an average performance while managing to tone down his overthetop psychotic jack nicholsonesque charactertype and has some nuance and subtly to his character jackson manages to capture both the hollywood caricature nature of the characters while at the same time giving them some emotional depth and making them relatable overall a fun adventure film that has great visuals and cinematography  mixed good and bad cgi effects good performances but is far too long with scene following scene of running through the jungle at points it becomes almost horror genrelike as anna naomi watts runs from one monster into another anna watts manages to go through a lot of trauma and running around without injury or even getting dirt on her dress for a long time it becomes a film that feels like the tag line should be people travel to an island and encounter lots of monsters
Sep 30 2012,positive,kind of sad at the end
Sep 30 2012,positive,always a pleasure to watch has a gripping sad dramatic tale with a decent underrated cast and a great soundtrack
Sep 30 2012,negative,the first hour sucked but after that it was okay
Sep 30 2012,negative,it was pretty goodi watched at school but i wasnt really payin that much attention
Sep 30 2012,negative,i waited three hours to see that stupid monkey fall off that stupid tower and there wasnt even a crack on the ground when he did
Sep 30 2012,positive,considering what it is this really isnt a badly made film in fact despite the cartoonish cgi its actually quite good but the problem is its about an hour and a half too long seriously does a movie about a giant ape need to be three hours and ten minutes long no no it does not but the cast is fabulous and the action sequences are fun i just wish there wasnt so much unnecessary filler
Sep 30 2012,positive,adrian broody pulled it off
Sep 30 2012,negative,only seen some of it
Sep 29 2012,positive,critics loved it fans hated it i am leaning slightly towards the critics but some parts were annoying and boring

Sep 27 2012,negative,good movie but long and drawn out
Sep 27 2012,positive,one of the best ones madea little long though but never dull
Sep 27 2012,neutral,i was in an extremely good mood when i saw this film and so i may be giving this movie more credit than it deserves but i thought it was all right  it was entertaining enough but it went on for way too long  it could have easily been half as long as it was and been a much better film  take for example the part where the brachios or whatever they were tripped and were falling all over each otherthere werent even enough of them in the pack to make the fall last that long  cut that scene in half youve shaved five or ten minutes off of the film right there  not only that but the longest parts of the film were the absolute worst like the film makers picked the most cringeworthy moments and decided to drag them out as long as possible  but you know it had its moments  the ice scene was unnecessary but cute
Sep 27 2012,positive,monkeytastic expected nothing less from peter jackson  beautiful animation
Sep 26 2012,positive,best jurassic park movie yet

Sep 13 2012,positive,i remember seeing this movie in the theater and have left with a good impression now reviewing on tv i realize that actually the movie splits into two when analyzed as an action movie its waaaay too much getting to border on the ridiculous in almost every scene most of the special effects are also quite dated especially the part of the forest effects that have not survived to 7 years of age now when analyzed as a dramatic film especially the final part there are qualities i bought the relationship between the actress and the monkey finally it is worth being seen yes despite all the flaws it was a good remake of the classic 30s

Aug 31 2012,positive,some people complained too much time on the island  it was good
Aug 31 2012,positive,a little long though
Aug 30 2012,positive,theres a reason why audience members didnt like king kong as much as i did its a long movie im not going to deny peter jacksons revisioning of a classic is over 3 hours long now its sort of weird but im not giving this film 5 stars im not even going to give this 45 stars and the reason why is becausesome scenes drag i hate saying that but the movie has about 4 or 5 scenes in which its pace slows down and it starts to drag now lots of people dont like the first 45 minutes because its not on skull island but i felt that the 3 or 4 out of the 5 scenes ive just said dragged was on skull island unfortuanely i felt some of the king kong and ann watching the sunset scenes just dragged but besides those handful of scenes this is still a great film it really boosts up the action and improves on some things like i loved some of the performances in the film and the music by james howard makes some of the draggy scenes enticing overall i have to say that even though some scenes drag this is still a great film if your looking for a modern day king kong made by one of the best directors of all time this is your flick
Aug 30 2012,neutral,twist to romantic movies
Aug 30 2012,positive,i loved it it was the best movie but the ending was sad

Aug 24 2012,positive,the original king kong back to action with a lot of action nd the great kong going ravadge
Aug 24 2012,positive,jacksons dark interpretation to this classic adventure is anything but disappointing while a whopping 3 hours and 7 minutes is a little overwhelming to the everyday film watcher length is barely phasable watts performance was glowing from beginning to end along with everybody else its easy to engage in the story and characters beginning and ending with a bang
Aug 23 2012,negative,good but didnt need to be so long

Aug 20 2012,positive,very good special effects although the plot line could have used a bit more
Aug 20 2012,negative,so long and stupid wast of film and lofe and time
Aug 20 2012,negative,this film greatly disappointed me jack black did his best rendition of carl denham but because of his past work in films like high fidelity and shallow hal among many other lowbrow comedies he never really gets the drama quite right i found it difficult to really engage with the leads as everyone despite the caliber of the cast felt like cardboard cutouts or barelydeveloped beings that just occupied space against the backdrop of then glorious cgi to his credit and his attention to detail jackson faithfully recreates the 30s environment through mostly cgi as well as sets though sparse he has a real knack for that however the most egregious of all errors in this film was the length the buildup as many critics have already said to actually seeing kong is outright painful i found myself checking my watch numerous times because i was frankly bored after a while i didnt much care about the action sequences or the very murky plot i also felt naomi watts portrayal of ann darrow was imitation at best and her interaction with the supposedly humanlike kong seemed disinterested and not at all genuine the ending of the film i felt was just as meanspirited as the original was i thought jackson would offer a more uplifting and mature conclusion and by the end i never felt like this was jacksons pet project
Aug 20 2012,positive,a bit slow to start but then it really takes off
Aug 19 2012,positive,i think its the best of the 3 versions
Aug 19 2012,positive,long winded but good

Aug 18 2012,positive,better than the previous kongs ive ever seen
Aug 18 2012,positive,was well put together  i probably would score it higher if i was a king kong fan  i am a peter jackson fan
Aug 18 2012,negative,lasted way to long for me graphics were really good though
Aug 18 2012,negative,almost gave it no stars maybe if i didnt go to the theature to see it it wouldnt have been as bad soooo long and only a few parts really kept my attention

Aug 17 2012,positive,not my favorite but king kong is still a fun trip if you can take all the annoying cgi effects
Aug 16 2012,neutral,a heartwarming tale of a the black guerr giant ape that fell in love with the white woman in 1920s new york it was definitely the best version yet and would have been thoroughly enjoyable if it werent for the dinosaur fights and the giant roaches
Aug 16 2012,positive,kong kong 2005 is directed by peter jackson and is a remake of the 1933 original it stars naomi watts as ann darrow adrien brody as jack driscoll jack black as carl denham jamie bell as jimmy and andy serkis does motion capture for king kong     this movie is extremely long running at around 3 hr 10 min whether that is a pro or a con is dependent on how much you are invested in these characters for me the film could have cut a good ten minutes or so    the first thing i noticed about the film was its vibrant colorful new york setting that takes place during the great depression in 1933 there is a wonderful saturated palate throughout the film and the visuals of the movies first 40 minutes contrast heavily with the pallet that is set at skull island     the movie spends a lot of time introducing you to the cast of characters and in all honesty this long introduction creates for some of the best parts of the film jack black is especially entreating in these moments most of the characters namely brody watts black jamie bell and serkis have their own individual personalties and each are easy to remember for their own unique traits naomi watts and brody do an admirable job of seeming truly in love with each other and as things take a turn for the worse brody considers it his his duty to go and save this damsel in distress why in distress well because shes been taken by kong of course     that being said there is also an entire slew of other characters that are essentially just there to die and be eaten by giant bugs and dinosaurs on skull island    what is skull island its a mysteriousâ uh island set quite literally in the middle of nowhere     once on said island there is a seemingly unnecessary scene of its indigenous people going madly wild causing the movie to take a sharp turn into the horror genre for a moment i found this annoying and that it would have been benefited from a little more subtly     this film has the best special effects i have ever seen hands down although the film was made in 2005 one would be hardpressed to find special effects done this well in any blockbuster film post or pre 05 the masterful job on the effects creates for quite unique character development between kong and ann darrow naomi watts which is quite the feat because of course they cannot speak to each other kong demonstrates a lot of personality and by the end of the film i found myself quite invested in him as though he were a real animal    but its not only kong who is brought to life remarkably well there are also huge beasts for a good chunk of the film that have grave encounters with kong and the humans there were perhaps a few to many of these scenes but non the less most of the time it was quite entertaining to see kong and 3 or 4 other carnivorous dinosaurs battle it out for the delicious morsel of food that is naomi watts but really this begs the questionâ why doe these damn dinos want to eat this pretty girl so bad it really doesnt make much sense though it isnt that difficult to ignore once you see how breathtaking the particular fightsequence is    the film can essentially be divided into four large chunks in this chronological order new york the ship skull island and new york again the final act is emotionally poignant but only if you are not exhausted from the 2 hr 40 min that it took to get up to that point    with good acting namely a brilliant performance from andy serkis as kong good character development and an emotional ending i would give this film an 810
Aug 14 2012,positive,it may have dragged a bit in some parts but peter jacksons visually resplendent remake of king kong still resonated well with me in the end
Aug 14 2012,positive,while it does take an excruciatingly long time for the characters to get to skull island it is well worth the wait
Aug 14 2012,positive,peter jacksons remake of the 1933 classic is a masterpiece of film making that boasts the most impressive special effects in the history of cinema strong performances by its ensemble cast and a rich script that is much deeper and complex than the glossy exterior would lead laymen to believe
Aug 13 2012,positive,i had to watch this movie with people who watched the original movie before  yes the one that came out in 1933 wasnt much fun hearing all their commentary   so it might not be as good as the first king kong movie and yes it is too freaking long  but it has its good moments and thats what matters 
Aug 13 2012,positive,i have mixed feelings about this one although the effects and cg are outstanding it was a bit too long and took a while to pick up some how the classics always turn out better
Aug 13 2012,positive,it was an extremely long movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,good suspensful movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,peter jackson does a great job at bringing the 8th wonder of the world to a new audience with stunning visuals good art direction and a solid cast
Aug 12 2012,positive,good moviebut nothing beats the original
Aug 12 2012,positive,if not for its impressive visuals cinematography and magnificent sound effects this movie would fall flat the acting was good but the story was terrible peter jackson demonstrated his commitment to detail in this film but the story was overly long and leaves you begging for a conclusion half way through visually impressive but an overly long story makes this production short of a memorable remake
Aug 11 2012,positive,i never thought a modern adaptation of this film would be the same and it wasnt it was different but very good    peter jackson strikes again james newton howard strikes again jack black strikes for one of the first times that i have ever seen the entire cast was extremely well picked and played their parts beautifully the cinematography was also top of the line    the main bone i have to pick with this movie is that it is 3 hours the end was dragged out too long    the animation was really good but no part of it was better than how they did kong himself his movement felt perfect they also packed so much sorrow into his eyes that it was truly beautiful i was on the verge of tears at several points in this film    some of the jungle chase scenes got a little repetitive i would have cut some of them out altogether even though most of them were unique and cool    they also did a really good job of giving nods to the original film things like killing a trex by snapping its jaw are pleasant easter eggs for people who like the original film    summary a really excellent followup to a classic i was very pleasantly surprised
Aug 11 2012,positive,a true love story that can never be
Aug 11 2012,positive,classic more heart then most other blockbusters and jack black has never been better then in this movie that and kung fu panda12
Aug 10 2012,negative,just like the old one nothing change
Aug 10 2012,positive,really good special effects
Aug 10 2012,positive,when i was a little younger i got scared but now that i am older its pretty good
Aug 9 2012,positive,am impressive retelling of the classic i thought everyone made this classy and peter jackson was unfairly put under too much pressure for a follow up after lotr
Aug 9 2012,positive,it was a real bore for a solid 45 minutes but it finally knuckled down and delivered the goods particularly the impressive special effects on kong that gave the original a necessary repair peter jackson should be happy for this rebirth
Aug 8 2012,negative,i liked the original better
Aug 7 2012,positive,very good but giant ape movies are not really my cup of tea
Aug 7 2012,positive,very very slow in the beginning but it picked up  and i wasnt prepared for the role jack black had too serious for my taste
Aug 7 2012,positive,i was unsure what i was stepping into im glad i gave yet another king kong remake the chance  adrian brody and jack black gave it 100 not only the special effect but keeping the orginal story board such a relief its so hard to come by great cinema  as always kong melted your heart his courage and love is pure talk about animal loveclassic genre now a modern day hit worth the watch
Aug 7 2012,positive,yes get this movie its my favorite
Aug 6 2012,positive,big fan of peter jackson and jack black is my hero
Aug 6 2012,positive,not bad not great either
Aug 6 2012,positive,cgi looking quickly outdated but good acting and story keeps this alive for its surprisingly long length communication between king kong and naomi watts is amazing to watch
Aug 6 2012,positive,awesome epic movie with beats on all types  a little slow to get going but worth the wait  plus the ape gets some in the end jk
Aug 6 2012,negative,the classic is still the best
Aug 6 2012,positive,it was visually stunningbut man it was way too long
Aug 5 2012,negative,too long and boring until kong hits land
Aug 5 2012,positive,one of the greatest adventure stories in hollywood history peter jacksons dream project is as good as event movies get king kong is visually spectacular and emotionally resonant
Aug 4 2012,positive,i find it astounding how the audience rating is at a 50 for such a masterfullycrafted epic by a filmmaker who has wellproven to be among the finest filmmakers in modern cinema sure king kong is indeed full of quarks and it does indeed have its fair share of problems but its mysterious captivating buildup to such a vast and wondrous journey with colorful characters are all what make this film among the best of its kind this is what remakes and hollywood blockbusters should strive to be    heres my full review 
Aug 4 2012,positive,great in theaters not home
Aug 4 2012,positive,this was good with great special effects
Aug 4 2012,positive,the much shorter original 1933 is more fun and a better movie so watch it first the beginning is way too slow and long it takes like 45 minutes for things to get interesting and you still dont see king kong until like 70 minutes in the middle is good with lots of action on a prehistoric island with dinosaurs king kong guys with guns and really large insects even though some of the action is just stupid the ending is good its just drawn out too much naomi watts is really good in this movie as well as adrian brody i kind of had a tough time accepting jack black as carl denham but i guess he was okay
Aug 4 2012,positive,interesting  rather see a remake of king kong vs godzilla where the radioactive breath fries him like its supposed to
Aug 3 2012,positive,the first hour is awesome the last hour is legit the middle hour lacks a good storyline and the graphics are pitiful
Aug 2 2012,positive,graphics were great but it was only an okay movie
Aug 2 2012,positive,love this movie  any movie that can move me to tears is a good movie
Aug 2 2012,positive,good length is an issue but the kong  anne story at its centre is very well done and it hold up as a big wondrous fantasyadventure flick
Aug 1 2012,negative,while i enjoyed aspects of this movie there were too many times where it went over the top which of course is jacksons style while the cgi is good i found myself more drawn into the love relationship between brody and watts and less interested in the giant primate the movie is suppose to be about some of the parts were simply too overdone for my liking and the movie is about 30 to 45 minutes too long
Aug 1 2012,negative,i expected more from this one
Jul 31 2012,positive,remade king kong and had the big time featured expereince tha peter jackson brings to all his movies
Jul 31 2012,positive,i cried very touchinglove it
Jul 30 2012,neutral,it was way too long and seemed to try and stuff as many gross scenes involving giant insects into it as possible
Jul 30 2012,positive,awesome movie love the fight scene between king kong and the trex
Jul 30 2012,positive,digitally grand emotionally spectacular and a great and inspiring performance from andy serkis aka gollum makes king kong just as much of a classic as the original
Jul 30 2012,neutral,overload visuals and overload material make this an exhaustive watch this is peter jackson accidentally going too george lucas

Jul 29 2012,positive,love the cinmenatogphy
Jul 29 2012,negative,way too drawn outseemed like it last forever
Jul 29 2012,positive,jackson and weta imbues the digital kong with a surprising level of facial expressions its a rather simplistic story which jackson tries to give some depth to in amongst the graphic workthrillaminute though  action jackson delivers on that
Jul 28 2012,positive,outstanding movie king kong is perfect from the amazing visual effects to the really good story and extraordinary cast king kong is fantastic do not complain about the length of the movie over 3 hours so what its three amazing hours that you will surely enjoy and wish to spend another three hours watching the movie again
Jul 27 2012,positive,the romance scenes with ann and king kong were annoying but other than that it was entertaining

Jul 26 2012,positive,its really not bad for a remake
Jul 26 2012,positive,a bright moving and welcome update on the 1933 film it works on many levels basically everything works well together and equates to another great peter jackson epic the only letdown is its runtime
Jul 25 2012,positive,great adaption of the classic story very good acting could show more action and violence because of today being a different time peter jackson has done it again
Jul 25 2012,positive,very much astounding and a remark on visual effects this film has made the image of king kong come alive once more
Jul 24 2012,positive,peter jackson knew full well that this was going to be great since he is defiantly a director to these large scale type of films this film offers great sometimes brilliant visuals and a great amount of heart i would say though that the film was a bit to long
Jul 24 2012,positive,when i was age 13 in 2005 ii have never seen the original so i saw this remake and i felt very compelled by what director peter jackson had to offer the eight wanderer of the world is one of the greatest and the most sympathetic creatures of my experience in cinema the many flaws of the film i can easily ignore and not even bother mention because i cannot express my love for this film enough it was that amazing
Jul 24 2012,positive,the costumes and effects were absolutely amazing you really felt like it was filmed in the 1930s
Jul 24 2012,positive,its visually entertaining but i prefer the original
Jul 24 2012,neutral,a poor remake which focuses too much on the visual effects and thus lacks something inbetween the shots too long and too stagnant at times thats why id much rather suggest you go and watch the original
Jul 24 2012,positive,best specialfx ever can watch it over and over and over  peter jackson never ceases to amaze me
Jul 23 2012,positive,its so long the first 45 min were blah but it does get intense
Jul 23 2012,positive,if you remember that this is a king kong movie than it will dazzie you
Jul 22 2012,positive,this movie was so hot i love the action though the ending made me cry cant lie
Jul 22 2012,positive,seen itgood movie but still essentially a love story

Jul 20 2012,negative,really dont wanna see an ape in distress over a woman movie was whack glad i didnt buy the ticket
Jul 20 2012,positive,it gave me this weirdmagnificent feeling king kong is indeed the definition of a great film
Jul 20 2012,negative,i love naomi watts but
Jul 20 2012,positive,at times this overlong epic is absolutely spectacular but by the end of the film we have only witnessed middling success this is definitely large scale filmmaking at its finest but its few missteps is its absurdly long run time and its failure to have a real connection with the audience
Jul 20 2012,negative,it was jurassic park iv meets donkey kong in an unnecessary length of time
Jul 20 2012,positive,the original not the remake
Jul 20 2012,neutral,they could of done better
Jul 19 2012,negative,maybe i need to rewatch it since it scored so surprisingly high but i remember it as gross overthetop nonsense with an intolerable 188 minute runtime who in hollywood signed off on a 3 hour movie anyway
Jul 19 2012,positive,sad  a work of art
Jul 19 2012,negative,it seems ok but i feel asleep duriong it

Jul 18 2012,positive,really good graphics
Jul 18 2012,positive,amazing visuals and action but far too long
Jul 17 2012,negative,i only caught parts of this but the really really real original is better
Jul 17 2012,positive,its a real visual spectacle a piece of classic cinema that was already immortalised and for me this just does the job of reminding us all why
Jul 16 2012,negative,it would have been better but the computer dinosaurs were nothing new because of jurassic park and the giant ape seemed like mighty joe young all over again naomi watts did a good job in the movie but jack black was terrible overall it was an easily forgettable movie
Jul 16 2012,positive,i want you to look me in the eye and say you dont like a giant monkey
Jul 16 2012,positive,in spite of king kong is another very good works of jackson sometimes comes to disappoint inter alia kong in this movie is more human than animal remembering that used to actor andy serkis as to make the movements of kong as well naomi watts of the overbearing sometimes becomes very uncomfortable but still its a great actress but not saying its bad that sometimes does not fail too often and the effects are not as innovative we were used to seeing giant dinosaurs in jurassic park please not again    but yes king kong is a great remake and exceeds creceres including history to the wrong version of laurentiis
Jul 16 2012,negative,ok good to compare to the other king kong movies
Jul 15 2012,positive,suprising a lot better then i thought
Jul 15 2012,positive,excellent graphics and a more modern version of the movie  i did expect more of the film though and it didnt deliver
Jul 15 2012,positive,when i was a kid i saw the 1st version then when i was a teen the 2ndbut this realease is much better and awsome
Jul 14 2012,positive,stunning effects and captivating imagery further emphasized by the beautiful music elicits much emotion only lacking in character development and the its excessive length yet it doesnt fail to keep its grip
Jul 14 2012,positive,peter jackson is amazing kind of a long movie but really good
Jul 14 2012,negative,as much as i wanted to enjoy this i actually ended up hating it to a large degree jack black has never had a movie performance that i enjoyed and this is one movie that did not need to follow closely to a dreadful book three hours of my life i want back the one star is for kong ripping apart the trexs jaws
Jul 14 2012,positive,kinda slow at the get go
Jul 13 2012,positive,this is a great movie i love the giant bug part
Jul 12 2012,positive,great remake with a sad tragic love  storyand jack balck ruled even though you expected to break out an acoustic guitar and sing a song about a giant monkey

Jul 9 2012,positive,the latest adaptation of the worlds most notorious gigantopithecusis especially the uncut version is far too long but like the original the story of king kong puts the word pop into corn as it thrills chills and touches the deepest innards of your soul
Jul 8 2012,positive,aweome special effects i love this movie
Jul 7 2012,neutral,this really wasnt as good as i thought it would be

Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie was ok but ive seen better
Jul 3 2012,positive,growing up i always loved dinosaurs and the day i saw the trailer and saw kong fighting the vrexes i knew i was going to love it but it wasnt until i saw it that i fell in love with it this movie puts so much heart and thought into every character and detail especially kong himself the final stand on the empire state building leaves a huge impression especially annes last few seconds of looking into kongs eyes before he falls and still is one of the saddest moments in a film to date in my opinion  peter jackson really made an amazing movie and it will always be one of my favorite films
Jul 3 2012,positive,too long but still pretty underrated
Jul 3 2012,neutral,i thought the photography animation and music were fantastic but this story got long and boring

Jul 3 2012,negative,it was a little to long
Jul 3 2012,positive,peter jacksons remake of the ape is a wellacted and exciting adventure film that pays homage to the original
Jul 3 2012,negative,it aint as i imagened
Jul 3 2012,positive,king kong is another sure winner its a three hour too long epic that is directed in the hands of a master peter jackson lord of the rings it has suspense creepy natives naomi watts huge flesheating insects dinosaurs  and a raging gorilla king kong for the most part this movie depends on special effects which is the reason why you should go and see it however beneath all that fat layer of action there is a sweethuman touch that focuses between animal and human the middle part tends to drag but the dinosaur stampede ignites the adventurous thrills all we really needed was indiana jones james newton howard at one of his best  88
Jul 2 2012,positive,its been a while but yeah i liked it
Jul 2 2012,positive,one of peter jacksons best film ever

Jul 1 2012,positive,unsurprisingly peter jackson hot off of his groundbreaking lord of the rings trilogy doesnt disappoint with king kong it is a beautiful love story and it features unparalled special effects that dazzle the eyes and sizzle to the touch this film has peter jackson written all over it and quite frankly no other director could have pulled it off this well
Jul 1 2012,positive,it was good but i thought it was going to be better
Jul 1 2012,positive,yea it did its job to entertain and i can say i was entertained but not the best story line

Jun 27 2012,negative,i only watched this movie because it came with the hddvd player i did not like it
Jun 27 2012,positive,one of the best remakes of all time especially by peter jackson who is a huge fan of the original movie
Jun 26 2012,negative,i only watched this because it was directed by peter jackson  id been blown away by the way he brought lord of the rings to life  man was i disappointed  tho i guess if you are a king kong fan itd probably be ok  oh the dinosaurs were unrealistic t rex was made into a whimp  im giving it 1 12 stars rather than 12 because the special effects were pretty good
Jun 26 2012,positive,i just want to root for kong
Jun 26 2012,positive,one of the best remakes ever made
Jun 26 2012,positive,long and boring but still pretty good

Jun 23 2012,positive,loved it kind of long but great movie
Jun 22 2012,positive,the best remake of king kong to date but peter jackson has a knack for making films more melodramatic than they need to be
Jun 22 2012,neutral,i dont really remember it thats why 2 12 stars
Jun 22 2012,positive,i loved all 3 hours and anyone who finds that too long can just not watch it because even when i first watched this as a small child i knew the ending but didnt care i just wanted to find out how to get there in philosophical terms the movie is like childhood it starts out slow with some good beginning learning who we are then the plot drags us faster and faster until we meet the known ending of our story if anything the story is not long enough

Jun 19 2012,positive,incredible special effects  sory dragged on too long for first hour but picked up afterward
Jun 19 2012,positive,peter jackson is a great director

Jun 18 2012,positive,well cast jack black surprised me it was the fastest 3 hours i spent in a movie
Jun 18 2012,positive,i enjoyed the film once and that is enough that fact that it is so very long makes it impossible to watch again
Jun 18 2012,positive,took too long to get to the jungle
Jun 18 2012,positive,i actually almost cried in this movie
Jun 18 2012,positive,great depiction of a great classic
Jun 17 2012,negative,um saw it  but wish i could put not interested
Jun 17 2012,negative,i was pretty disappointed with all the technology an they dropped the ball
Jun 17 2012,positive,the peter jackson that the public should recognize him as returning to his new zealand filming roots for isle inspiration peculiar fantasy admiration and audience concern gone are the temporarily feigned folklore formalities owing to the accolades in the bag replaced by an innocent homage phase in the form of a remake that hugely improves on the original even when taking relative decade capabilities into account the comparatively monstrous budget gives way to an impressive script that seamlessly evokes the 30s time period  as if either period piece or unsuspecting adventure epic direction couldve proceeded the start  as well as an entertaining jurassic setting choc full of the visible inspiration responsible for any of jacksons geek projects it swiftly engages despite the duration and you cant fault the cast shockingly blending usualside thorn jack black in with the professional likable mix matching the quality in the special effects and directing departments essentially outdoes the combined lotr trilogy for my moneys worth
Jun 17 2012,positive,this movie was amazing but it was too sad at the end when kong dies but this one you just cant miss
Jun 17 2012,negative,garbage even the cg sucked didnt even finish watching it
Jun 17 2012,positive,it was awesome till it put more love scenes in it
Jun 16 2012,positive,entertaining and intriguing but drags a little
Jun 16 2012,positive,really good movie but too long
Jun 16 2012,negative,to long for a movie its more of a borgfie
Jun 16 2012,neutral,if the whole point of going to this island is to bring back a giant ape why in the hell did they not seem to care about all of those dinosaurs that is only the beginning of why this movie sucks
Jun 16 2012,neutral,disappointed in the movie  expected more from jackson
Jun 15 2012,negative,they should have traded a writer in on an editor
Jun 15 2012,negative,peter jackson has to realize that not all of his movies have to be huge epics entirly to looong
Jun 15 2012,positive,was boring until kong came into the scene
Jun 15 2012,positive,oh what can i say the ape himself was amazing he looked gorgeous he was an amazingly likable character he was a hero worth rooting forand his ending is tragic this kong is one of my favorite characters ever the 3rex fight scene is one of the best action scenes ever and proves that kong is king  unfortunately the rest of the movie happened brody did a good job and jack black did a great job at being a jerk and as much as i hate her previous work watts did ok she is one of the few actresses in the kong movies to actually love kong so i give her credit for that for once id love to see the ending rewritten see kong win the video game for this movie did that and it was glorious i was just sad to see such an amzing character meet his unavoidable end
Jun 15 2012,positive,it was an excelent movie aside from the language of course i think it would have been better without it i absoulutly love adrian brody and jack black
Jun 15 2012,positive,amazing special effects bring kong to life very long but very enjoyable
Jun 15 2012,positive,didnt think i would like but did
Jun 15 2012,positive,cool movie but about an hour and a half too long
Jun 14 2012,negative,like the leading lady and jack black poor monkey
Jun 14 2012,positive,perfect i saw the whole 3 hours  7 minutes in the theater
Jun 14 2012,positive,fantastic movie pretty sad kinda long
Jun 14 2012,positive,a gripping remake of a classic
Jun 14 2012,positive,for once we have a film that delivered even more visuals than promised so much in fact that you wish some editor had grabbed peter jackson by his scraggly beard and told him look man youve gotta cut some of this you can tell this same story with just two hours and have a lot more oomph to it     dont let that scare you away this is a fine adventure movie with a fine cast say what you will i love jack black as carl denham though andy serkis bit role as a gruff cook remains my favorite character beautiful set pieces beastly beasties and some truly resonant moments make this a mustsee
Jun 13 2012,positive,i like this movie a lot it has really good graphic and its also a awesome movie
Jun 13 2012,positive,an amazing remake peter jackson does it againg
Jun 13 2012,positive,this is one of my favorites loved the 76 version but this one blew it away the effects are mind blowing
Jun 13 2012,negative,visually stunning but just too long
Jun 13 2012,positive,i thought it was a really good remake
Jun 13 2012,positive,i have always liked big hairy gorillas
Jun 13 2012,positive,i didnt really like how it ended but other then that it was a good movie
Jun 13 2012,positive,really like this movie watched it the first time when i was only
Jun 13 2012,positive,peter jackson does a rare thing he remakes a groundbreaking film and does a better job at doing the story justice than the original film crew did king kong is a film that uses undeniably spectacular visual effects and follows a rather unique story to create a masterpiece that all filmmakers dream of making i wish that there would have been more time with ann and king kong and maybe less of the people looking for her
Jun 13 2012,neutral,i cant watch this moveive only seen it once and that was enoughit is way too long and isnt interesting enough to keep my add mind focused
Jun 13 2012,positive,5 stars just for the fact that naomi watts comes out in it
Jun 12 2012,negative,this was a stupid movie the girl falls in love with a gorilla
Jun 12 2012,positive,first king kong chick is scared to death this king kong she loves the ape like a pet beautiful movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,it was ok i am not a big fan of jack  black
Jun 12 2012,negative,i ran away cuz i didnt wanna see it it makes no sense
Jun 12 2012,positive,giant monkey thats it
Jun 12 2012,negative,long  just long  it felt like an eternity trying to sit through this  all that and it wasnt very good either  the story could not hold up to the length  just a dissapointment
Jun 12 2012,positive,the missing star is for its running time which is too long but otherwise a masterpiece to behold in all its technological splendor
Jun 12 2012,positive,this remake actually had some good story elements added to the original even if they may seem pointless  an example would be how the girl somewhat fell in love with kong after he saved her a couple times  but the movie is long and drawn out and uses slowmo too much  and the battle scenes arent very suspenseful but they dont suck  and you just knew how the movie would end  it always ends that way  if you want to watch a three hour king kong whether you like it or not is your decision
Jun 12 2012,positive,a masterwork for its era dated now
Jun 12 2012,positive,visually stunning and a love story ahhh
Jun 11 2012,positive,dont see how else you could remake a movie about giant apes playing with some womans dress the original is an unmatched classic and this is faithfully imaginative
Jun 11 2012,positive,astonishing visuals and wonderful performance not to mention the excellent direction loved it
Jun 11 2012,positive,one of my favorite of all time is getting better view afther view the scariest and the most exiciting adventure of all time like the oldest one afther an a hour this is a nonstop action spectacle
Jun 11 2012,positive,its not letting my give it 5 stars but if i could i would  i bawled my eyes out
Jun 11 2012,neutral,ive only seen part of it but i wasnt really interested in itits to long
Jun 11 2012,positive,hot monkey action  a little too fairy tale at times but jackson sets the right mood on the island
Jun 10 2012,neutral,jack black is cool just not a good flick for him or naomi
Jun 10 2012,positive,awsome but i have only seen part of it with my best friend lindsey
Jun 9 2012,positive,from what i saw it was good
Jun 9 2012,positive,the visuals and action are top notch and andy serkis is phenomenal as king kong
Jun 9 2012,negative,it didnt really catch my attention
Jun 9 2012,positive,in contrast to its original predecessor many films fail to recapture the elements that make it a good movie the 2005 film may be undoubtably lengthy for many people but it never falls short and it all seems to deliver in every way to the duration of the film which concludes to its epic ground breaking finale that joins its actionpacked and romatically soft at heart moments together king kong isnt for everyone but it surely was everything for me
Jun 8 2012,negative,i have no words  this was three different movies in one and they all sucked
Jun 8 2012,positive,i cried at the end too
Jun 8 2012,positive,different for my favortie actor jack black but good

Jun 7 2012,positive,dont know it till youve seen it
Jun 7 2012,positive,it made me cry when he died
Jun 7 2012,positive,once you get past the boring first hour of this film and get to kong the film picks up its pace  kong is well done and naomi watts is beautiful as anne his human love
Jun 6 2012,positive,it was a great movie i liked it alot it was a long movie but i never once payed attention to anything but the movie
Jun 5 2012,positive,i love this movie nuff said
Jun 5 2012,negative,i thought kong was jack black without having shaved for a week imagine my confusion
Jun 5 2012,positive,if it were any shorter the message would have been lost

Jun 5 2012,positive,i loved it it made me cry

Jun 2 2012,positive,jacksons love for mighty beast with a beauty heart kong and ann two beings living a very lonely life among ugly environments in the tow islands skull and manhattan met each other and share the primitive aesthetic consciousness and fun together if you had a experience having dogs in your life you can understand about what the beauty is
Jun 1 2012,positive,this is a great movie and really significant
Jun 1 2012,positive,a solid story and great visuals make this version of the 1933 classic an enjoyable and fun experience
Jun 1 2012,positive,same old story but the new and better technology gives this movie a new lifenaomi wattsadrien brodyjack black all did a great jobespecially jack blacks energy as always is a great thing to watchpeter jackson from the reputation of lord of the rings have retained the broadness of the movie
May 31 2012,positive,although this is a remake it was sooo sad that it made me cry in the end  on top of that the picture quality is pretty good
May 31 2012,positive,i love this movie
May 31 2012,positive,one of hollywoods greatest movies is rebooted again and is phenomenal
May 31 2012,negative,it was not great at all
May 31 2012,positive,seen it way too many times
May 30 2012,positive,seventytwo years after the eighth wonder of the world left his massive footprint on cinematic history peter jackson brings the globes most famous ape back to the big screen in epic fashion this beautifully shot remake double the length of the treasured original gives dimension to the characters even kong himself whose humane qualities are brought to life with the combination of incredible cgi and an outstanding performance by andy serkis its quite rewarding to see the tender interactions between kong and his beloved blonde  the lovely naomi watts in an excellent turn  as his affections for her grow stronger over the course of the film the mandatory action sequences are also very impressive and are exciting to watch though the computerised effects disappoint on some occasions here after a mixed bag of remakes sequels and spinoffs king kong is back where he belongs
May 30 2012,positive,the only part of the movie you need to watch is when there on the island start the movie when there on the island and end it when there leaving the island
May 30 2012,positive,i love this movie  more than anything 4realthis is my movie an its sad
May 30 2012,positive,better then the original

May 30 2012,positive,i didnt care for it too much when i saw it in theaters but its getting better
May 29 2012,positive,too long but the scene at the top of the empire state bldg just took my breath away awesome
May 29 2012,positive,it had great graphics and scenes
May 29 2012,positive,this is digital adventure movie is cool
May 28 2012,positive,not only is it gorgeous to watch but king kong also has a lovable cast of characters the ape himself is easily one of the greatest looking creations in cinema history its long but it is worth watching for the spectacle and the great acting that goes along with it well shot well paced great action a fun film all around that greatly improves on the original
May 28 2012,positive,its  movie i would see over
May 28 2012,positive,oh peter jackson worked wonders in this film his influence from king kong 1933 was great but nothing stops jacksons creative license in many ways i feel that he improved on the story i loved what he did with the relationship between kong and anne it was absolutely beautiful and i never saw kong as a monster a beautiful epic that i need to revisit soon
May 27 2012,positive,i personally thought that this movie was an excellent work of art not only paying homage to its predecessors but also showing the audience the morehuman side of the beast itself  a side that makes it more human than monster
May 27 2012,positive,this movie is a bit long but its good
May 26 2012,negative,originally titled too long
May 26 2012,negative,not great  see the original instead and enjoy it for the cultural nostalgia

May 26 2012,positive,its never at all dull or boring  a fantastic remake
May 26 2012,positive,a bit too long to tell its story with a few goofy and unecessary scenes but king kong still remains vastly entertaining thanks to its brilliant scope stunning effects and spectacular action sequences
May 25 2012,positive,a brilliant story alongside top notch cgi will keep your attention throughout the otherwise rather long 3 hour film
May 25 2012,positive,could have been better
May 25 2012,positive,i love this movie it is action and romance and this gorilla is on his way to stardom to me
May 25 2012,negative,okay film for a rainy sunday
May 25 2012,neutral,give me fay wray anyday
May 25 2012,positive,a cool movie with tons of awesome effects but just too much substance
May 24 2012,positive,a very bold attempt at recreating the original im torn about this pieceâ while naomi watts makes a name for herself in this remake as her own star but like a michael bay cg monster this movie takes an immensely long time to get to the crux of the matter
May 24 2012,positive,good special effects  not too bad will cop the dvd later
May 24 2012,positive,see previous statement regarding mr jackson
May 24 2012,positive,a great jackson epic not quite up to lotr
May 24 2012,negative,this movie was fantastic the first time i saw it  i slept through it the second  its far too long to see more than once and even then the first time its carried by the special effects
May 23 2012,positive,one of the most underrated and overlooked movies ever made on the face of the planet peter jackson is my favorite director of all time and he put in a lot of extreme craft passion emotion and spirit into this remake of the 1933 original which is the movie that had inspired him to be a filmmaker ever since he was a young child i also dont see what some people have against jack blacklike at all because not only did i bought into his character and fully understood his motivations in this film but he has shown that he is not always just a goofy comedian he gave some excellent dramatic acting chops in here and i even felt for the guy at times throughout what are you people complaining about really
May 23 2012,positive,i really like big mean monkeysgorillas
May 23 2012,negative,a really tense couple of hours of almost not much happening but tension
May 23 2012,positive,another favorite i just watchd it last night
May 23 2012,positive,uncoventional love story
May 23 2012,positive,peter jacksons dream project isnt as great as you thought it would be but it does succeed as a blockbuster remake of a classic japanese film
May 23 2012,negative,i though king kong was ok
May 22 2012,positive,havt seen it not too interesed 33

May 19 2012,negative,i thought special effects got better since the 40s
May 19 2012,positive,the last line is the greatest i knew this was a masterpiece once jack black and kyle chandler walked up to the longneck dinosaurs and said how audiences for their film were going to know how real it was that was the part when i thought it was real  leave it up to peter jackson to make a three hour long epic based off of a former classic original with great acting jawdropping special effects and swell directing
May 18 2012,positive,considering kong was all cg he looked pretty real
May 18 2012,positive,great movie one of my favorites of all time
May 18 2012,positive,first hour is boring but rest is good really good
May 17 2012,positive,it was such a sad ending
May 16 2012,negative,alright not really my cup of tea
May 16 2012,negative,this would have been a truly excellent remake if jackson didnt spend so much time with the googoo eyes going on between kong and his ladyfriend
May 16 2012,neutral,the first one was the best one
May 16 2012,positive,okay first of all you got to give niomi watts snaps for screaming soo much i mean seriously secondly i like the fact that jack black plays a role other than his usual funny stuff thirdly i love animals so thats why i gave this movie such a good rating
May 15 2012,positive,peter jackson takes the 8th wonder of the world to the big screen in his adaptation that wonderfully takes it to beautiful spots with jack black at his absolute finest
May 15 2012,positive,good effects jack black wasnt too funny and colin hanks is starting to look and sound like daddy
May 14 2012,negative,a comedy not intentionally

May 13 2012,positive,really great remake of an old classic
May 13 2012,positive,extremely good effects
May 13 2012,positive,this is a great film the acting is good the visual effects couldnt be better and the non diegetic sound is really good at immersing you in the movie jack black plays character carl denham and he doesnt waste time on the camera every scene with him is serious yet hilarious well done jack and pete
May 13 2012,positive,the special effects were good but the movie dragged on
May 13 2012,neutral,while peter jacksons opulent version is faithful to the original classic film that inspired it its simply way too selfindulgent and tedious to hold a candle to the classic the story is essentially a more contemporary reconstruction of the original king kong but without any of the simple charm and an abundance of scenes that seem to only exist as filler while i like the fact that they were trying to capture the time in which the original king kong was made i find that the film is way too absorbed in the style and what we get is essentially an overly decadent pulp fantasy that revels in its selfimposed antiquity the acting is alright but i find it hard to make any connection with the characters perhaps im not supposed to but i still think that some of the characters have a tendency to overact the visuals and special effects i must admit were stateoftheart about a decade ago but nowadays they arent as impressive to me and i find that this is especially true as the films bloated length takes its toll the epic action i feel doesnt have as much of an impact as it should have mainly because like every other scene in the film the filmmakers stretch the monster fight out for as long as they possibly can to the point that its more of a chore to watch than it should have been this should have been a brilliant upgrade to the original king kong but if theres one lesson hollywood keeps forgetting its that theres only one true king of the apes
May 13 2012,negative,just for the graphics
May 12 2012,negative,4 freaking hours i only liked the giant king kong animal
May 12 2012,positive,good movie kept my attention

May 12 2012,positive,great special fx and good story
May 12 2012,positive,really good its a very long movie if you want to sit through for 3hrs and 15min
May 12 2012,positive,awsome       a storyline made better
May 12 2012,positive,honestly this movie was really really good when i would watch the old original king kong it was just there i mean i would watch and it wasnt of any interest to me it was something to watch on the television because there was nothing else on and i wasnt this huge king kong fan so like when i would see this new king kong movie i would just pass it when i would rent movies at blockbuster video blehking kong why is everyone bragging how this movie is soooo good hes just a big dumb gorilla but then very recently i just decided to give this movie a try because it cant hurt i tell you whatthis king kong doesnt even come close to the original this one had me wowingvery impressive king kong looked real for once and just his expressions were so real and just wow the bug scene was crazy i defiantly recommend this movie and give it a full rating
May 11 2012,negative,dunno about this one either

May 10 2012,neutral,too drug out has a good story line though
May 10 2012,positive,had a slow beginning but overall once it got to the island it took off love the scene where king kong is in the city playing on the ice
May 10 2012,negative,the first twenty minutes or so is okay but after that its one of the most boring movies ever
May 10 2012,negative,not the original thats for sure
May 10 2012,positive,really fun ride long but fun
May 10 2012,neutral,i love it when he throws a fit
May 9 2012,positive,its a visual feast first and foremost but its a damn good one  and while he may not have captured the enigmatic complexity of the original films carl denham it was nice to see jack black do some great work with a more serious role  you also really see how much jackson loves the original film having cited it as his favorite  as far as remakes go this is one of the better ones
May 9 2012,positive,i thought this movie was very enternatining and the graphics were awesome
May 9 2012,positive,i loved it  it was tons of fun  kong was a very funny character when he wasnt being terribly dangerous  the relationshhip between kong and the girl was sweet and it was sad to see kong go  the movie producer was played magnificently capturing the greed of the human heart very well
May 9 2012,neutral,good movie i dont think i could watch it again
May 9 2012,negative,good visualsabout two housrs of unnecessary crap lame story line irrelevant zombie natives

May 3 2012,negative,one of the most boring films ive ever seen  but then ive never been a monkey fan
May 3 2012,positive,the pure level of special effects created and quality of which they are achived is remarkable andy serkis uses his talents to the full giving his beastly character both reality and personality and the remaining cast including jack black browraisingly perform just as well also with a genuinely oldfashioned story and feeling this rendition is like the oldtime classic updated for todays experience
May 3 2012,positive,good flicki like the original better
May 3 2012,negative,another terrible one
May 3 2012,neutral,good attempt but with that first hour dragging so much this barely registers over two stars fast forward to the island and you got three baby

Apr 29 2012,positive,own it action pacted madness cute writer is in it
Apr 29 2012,negative,i cannot fathom how peter jackson managed to create a monumental genredefining trilogy of classic material and then turn another great story into a monumental waste of energy and money  between the acting the script the pacing and the special effects i seriously cant pinpoint the very worst part of this film because there are so many unbelievably inept components that im too busy laughing about it to choose one  the only reason i have a copy on disc is for the 34 frames where you can see through naomi watts underwear true story ive watched those few frames for more time than ive spent trying to watch the rest of the film  peter jackson needs to get back to his roots and make something really weird  a giant apegod should seem weird but it just doesnt anymore
Apr 29 2012,positive,arent they going to do anything different with king kong
Apr 29 2012,positive,very kool movie and awesome special effects

Apr 26 2012,negative,the original was better
Apr 26 2012,positive,super except for jack black loved how crazyass the caddie from happy gilmore was in this one i mean whats the deal with climbing onto the vine when theres nothing but 10 km of air between the end of the vine and the ground and then jumping off the vine onto one of the pterodactyl things hahaha and why would one ever climb the empire state building to the very top

Apr 23 2012,positive,while some may find it a little tedious the spectacular pay off is easily worth the wait and while it may not be the magnus opus that is jacksons rings trilogy it does showcase the signature flare drive and love for detail that proves jackson  will continue to never disappoint
Apr 22 2012,positive,a good movie with great special effects that drags at times and is overall too long of a movie

Apr 11 2012,positive,ironically in the year of piracys rise and at the tip of the global recession peter jackson releases this faithful remake of the 1933 classic its effective in picturing out a state in industrial heights and the attack of kong made it all the more devastating with superb special effects this nearperfect backdrop is insync with surprisingly superb turns from naomi watts jack black and especially andy serkis a mustsee for movie lovers and political analysts alike

Apr 6 2012,neutral,not bad but waytoolong its not that i didnt like it but i just dont think i could ever sit through the whole thing again and some of the stuff in it was pointless and drags on forever such as the battle with the giant insects or the race with the dinosaurs on the island
Apr 6 2012,negative,too sad to even watch
Apr 6 2012,positive,cool special effects the dino fight was amazing but in the end way to sad and depressing for me
Apr 6 2012,negative,this debacle was way to long totally unbelievably set in shity graphics  i like the 77 version much better it had comedy as well id rather a man in a monkey suit as apposed to a computer generated gorilla that looked so fake and also theres to much use of the word goddamn in this jack black version
Apr 6 2012,neutral,too little of action at begginning
Apr 6 2012,positive,ok but the 1933 version is better
Apr 6 2012,positive,in quite a few ways its better than the second lotr
Apr 6 2012,positive,good movie   the big ape is a sucker  for blondes  lol  she was the death of him

Apr 4 2012,positive,really good but loooong
Apr 4 2012,negative,seen it a long time ago not my thing
Apr 4 2012,positive,wow thats all i can day for this one
Apr 4 2012,positive,straight off the bat from the lotr franchise peter jackson wastes no time in skillfully remaking the film that urged him to make them when we was older the visuals are ones again astounding a spectacular feat from weta making it their project to beat although the majority of the acting is far from revolutionary jack black  stands out here in a dramatic if humourousrole as the director that ultimately leads his crew to certain death at the hands of skull islands monstrous inhabitants with powerful scripting and a touching performance from andyserkis who plays the troubled ape wrapped in visual effects to die for this is two and a half hours of your time youd be glad spening watching this
Apr 4 2012,negative,too long and too slow if it were shorter id be a good movie
Apr 4 2012,positive,it could have been better
Apr 4 2012,positive,best kong yetgraphics were awesome

Apr 4 2012,positive,phenomenal special effects and one of the best fantasy films ive ever seen does get a little ridiculous with plausibility of the characters surviving certain events and not everyone is in love with the runtime but its one hell of a ride very emotional ending that you know is coming but it still gets you
Apr 4 2012,positive,just adorable and veeeeery long
Apr 4 2012,neutral,the only thing that got me through this was the beautiful visuals
Apr 4 2012,positive,i hoped they would change the ending so he wouldnt die
Apr 4 2012,positive,not a bad remake of the original and i hate remakes
Apr 4 2012,negative,too much cgi  also why would use jack black for such an iconic film the only had one amiazing actor in the whole which was adrien brody dont get me wrong peter jackson is an outstanding director
Apr 3 2012,positive,could have been better
Apr 3 2012,positive,everything about this movie is huge including the running time peter jackson didnt realize he was working on a nonlord of the rings film
Apr 3 2012,positive,pretty good film overall a bit long and the dinosaurs could have been more epic and i like the original kong from the 30s the best still
Apr 3 2012,positive,too much going on for me and wayyy too long but a good movie
Apr 3 2012,neutral,would have been great if not for the stereotypical negative portrayal of indigenous peoples
Apr 3 2012,positive,anything with ed izzard executive transvestite is worth seeing
Apr 3 2012,positive,this is a pretty decent movie
Apr 3 2012,negative,jackson shouldve stuck with lotr and bowed out gracefully besides faye raye was prettier

Apr 2 2012,positive,trex fight one of the best ever but they tried to draw out some stuff more than they should have but it was a decent remake i thought
Apr 2 2012,positive,way to long just lucky every shot is gorgeous and the actors are engaging a near extraordinary pic
Apr 2 2012,positive,big change for peter jackson but its was the fist attempt to see king kongs expresions compared to the old versions

Apr 1 2012,positive,people say that peter jackson was doing well and he somehow stepped out of his comfort zone and made this and didnt do so well i here to say there wrong this is a great movie the action was stunning and the quality was beautiful the plot and story was tremendous i loved the action personally i though that it was the best part of the whole film this movie was very enjoyable and i would watch it again
Apr 1 2012,positive,it was cool weird that a monkey likes a woman though freaked me out a giant monkey
Apr 1 2012,positive,besides the meaningless 1 hour introduction they did a good job of redoing a classic

Mar 21 2012,positive,crypass the tissues
Mar 20 2012,positive,effects were good but there was alot of crappy parts all of which were completely uneccessary removing these crappy parts wouldve made the movie better and mercifully shorter yikes that was long yikes
Mar 20 2012,positive,brilliant wish king kong won
Mar 19 2012,positive,pretty cool fighting with dinos and the monkey dies in the end and jack black rocks
Mar 18 2012,positive,a perfect mix between good characters and spectacular visuals this film is one of peter jacksons greatests a wonder of a film
Mar 18 2012,positive,enough critics have rated it high enough where as i feel like the only reason that only 52  of the audience liked it is because of the slightly long run time
Mar 18 2012,positive,it may be long but overall this film is badass
Mar 18 2012,negative,how long is it it felt like days this is probably the most unfaithful adaptation of king kong ever made
Mar 18 2012,positive,five stars because although i feel it is missing something i cannot quite figure out what it could be brodys cardboardesque performance  jackson developed kongs character so much and made the heroine so likable that it makes up for any shortcomings the film may have  great effects as well
Mar 17 2012,positive,i love this movie it shows us what technology today is capable of and that is creating very real looking animals  king kong looked very real in this movie and i loved that there was also a story that you enjoyed following unlike with other king kong movies i have seen
Mar 17 2012,negative,40 a 3hour movie where the only interesting and impressive thing is a big monkey anything else is extremely boring
Mar 16 2012,positive,alot of good visual effects just to much ape  jk
Mar 15 2012,positive,two words    christ stevens
Mar 13 2012,positive,it was definitely difficult to watch jack black a comedian in a serious role  however the connection between the 1933 version and this 2008 version is very respected i now own this on dvd
Mar 12 2012,positive,peter jacksons king kong might not be that memorable but everyone knows how epic the film was it is excitingly fun and extremely well made naomi watts eyes towards the cgi king kong is just breathtaking and just pure love there are some cgi flaws which gives over the top sequences but nonetheless it was beautifully stunning superb cinematography that jackson made this long dramatic and epic thinking this was one of the best adventure epics that we will be seeing in such a long long time
Mar 12 2012,positive,intro was way too long
Mar 11 2012,positive,the best remake of king kong so far the original is better but this film is still enjoyable the cgi can be great in some scenes but messy in others the cast of characters was great though jacks character is completely different than the original the film is pretty long but its nicely paced i didnt mind the length at all and i can get through it without a breeze the story is enchanting as the original and the battles are fierce  not much bad about this film at least to me
Mar 9 2012,positive,great graphics great acting and good directing but for some reason the old story just did not work for me it is probably because it has already done before and you know the ending
Mar 7 2012,positive,great graphics that make the movie come alive especially on an hd screen  i did think it would be better from the trailer but still i wasnt disappointed
Mar 6 2012,negative,the first hour is nothing and the second hour is slow and everything after that i dont remember
Mar 5 2012,positive,a personal favorite this is one of the best remakes of all time and tackling a classic like king kong and rising to the ocassion makes this one even more impressive
Mar 4 2012,positive,very impressive peter jackson has done it again
Mar 4 2012,positive,close to perfection but you cant beat the all time classic
Mar 4 2012,positive,peter jackson gives emotion to the famed ape through the masterful work of the cgi  solid performances by jack black and naomi watts but the scenes with kong are the ones that truly make this movie worth watching
Mar 4 2012,negative,overblown and terrible
Mar 3 2012,positive,i really like king kong i seen this movie so many times
Mar 2 2012,positive,the only parts i love is the connection with naomi watts and king kong they stole the show jack black was ok but couldve done better
Mar 2 2012,positive,i liked it got a forty min period when it draaags quality fight scenes between king kong n tyrannosauras rex
Mar 2 2012,positive,dont listen to the audience this movie is great and the special effects are mind blowing
Mar 2 2012,positive,can there be too much of a great thing  king kong clearly answered this question and the answer is yes  there are so many cross species battles near deaths and actual deaths in the jungle sequences that it borders on absurd  there are dozens of monsters and bugs plus encounters with scary islands natives  im not sure why i didnt love this movie but its clear that maybe i dont care how a giant monster gets into a city to destroy it or even why the monster is there in the first place  maybe its better that we dont know  king kong faces demise relatively quickly in the city compared to the jungle scenesafter he ice skates and giggles  worth a watch but not great
Mar 1 2012,positive,peter jacksons remake is great starts off slow but does great justice to the original
Mar 1 2012,positive,its almost as good as the 1933 version but spends too long on a boat doing nothing
Mar 1 2012,positive,fairly entertaining adrian brody a great actor threw me off on this maybe because im not used to him being an action star
Mar 1 2012,positive,this is one of my favorite movies it has horrorish parts and sadness it was really very good
Feb 28 2012,positive,better than i thought
Feb 27 2012,positive,amazing animation very well made
Feb 27 2012,positive,this one is very long but i never felt the loss of time just the entertaining moment of this visually epic remake
Feb 26 2012,positive,to bad the big guy still dies in this one
Feb 26 2012,negative,ha i think my sisters review says it better than i could what a horrible long tortorous dissapointment    the movie is just boring it starts out good but then it becomes a 3hr special effects experiment in masochism heh in the end you dont care about anything going on and youre glad you get to leave peter jacksons first movie after his decline into pretension
Feb 25 2012,positive,if you did not like this movie   you are and forever will be a moron
Feb 25 2012,positive,peter jackson is a god
Feb 25 2012,positive,brilliant remake peter jackson is a great director
Feb 25 2012,positive,a big disappointment especially for a movie that did a great job of ratcheting up the tension in the first hour or so of the movie jackson also made 1932 nyc look spectacular gave motivation to black watts and the rest of the cast suddenly the movie morphed into a bpicture complete with action movie cliche after action movie cliche that just made the audience squirm and groan the movie looks great but it just felt long and ultimately boring
Feb 25 2012,positive,to many special affects takes away from the real story beauty and the beast more interaction between kong and naomi watts is what the film need but the film was entertaining
Feb 25 2012,positive,too long but still a solid movie
Feb 24 2012,positive,ill admit this film got over the top and melodramatic however this film is likewhat the second remake of the classic so it kinda made it seem like the original if it were made today and i thought that was cool   i really did enjoy jack blacks performance as carl because he played it and looked like orsen wells and did a pretty good job all i thought he was missing was his voice if he had the dynamic voice of wells it would have been perfect  however there were a few flaws in the film not really bad flaws but bad enough to notice   the film had some very exciting action scenes but i felt that there were too many of them and the film seemed to stop for these scenes very few of them seemed to actually continue the story  there were times i said finally when they got back to the story   there was one scene shared between kong and anne where they are sliding on ice it was holding on for too long and i was saying we get it they like each other move on it was a nice scene but didnt need to be too long   the end was sad as it should be but i couldnt help but feel glad it was done   in the end i did like the movie it was exciting adventurous funny sad and fun a great movie to watch
Feb 24 2012,neutral,sick special effects 3 hours not necessary
Feb 23 2012,positive,they did a great job on this i was blown away when i first watched it and have watched it so many times and will watch it many many many more times
Feb 22 2012,positive,an awesome remake with good graphicsgreat actingan amazing plot and a lot of monsters
Feb 20 2012,negative,stick with the original this movie is too damn long and it doesnt help when the unimpressive cgi insists on being bombastic and excessive i still cant believe that the art of cgi hasnt progressed well at all in the last two decades i thought the dinosaurs in jurassic park looked more wondrous and realistic than those in this flick
Feb 19 2012,positive,great effects good story but it didnt have to be 3 hrs long
Feb 19 2012,positive,i like the original best
Feb 18 2012,positive,very very good  a taste of an oldfashioned movie in modern quality projection  a simple script and complex emotions  the traditional movie formula of the pretv era  good for the record and good education

Feb 16 2012,positive,i couldnt take jack black seriously
Feb 16 2012,positive,its not peter jacksons best but that doesnt mean its bad by any means a little lengthy and corny but a rousing spectacle all the same
Feb 15 2012,neutral,good movie but the fall backs were jack black trying to be serious and it was about 4 hours long
Feb 15 2012,positive,i love every pj movies and this was a great idea to do a remake of king kong with all the cool special effects we have today a nice film and naomi watts is fabulous
Feb 14 2012,positive,wow  the bugsthe bugs  this was a great remake
Feb 13 2012,positive,visually stunning inflated length makes it a challenge to watch
Feb 13 2012,positive,its not that its bad it just lacks the spirit of the original
Feb 12 2012,positive,awesome scale i love peter jackson
Feb 12 2012,positive,more proof that peter jackson can take  things that were old and make them new and appealing 
Feb 12 2012,positive,i dont see what the big deal is it was pretty good
Feb 12 2012,positive,very good remake only thing is by the time it reached the end i was tired of it not because it was bad but because it was so long

Feb 11 2012,positive,it had its highs and lows kong stole the show great graphics and well timed with that being said its a must see in my book

Feb 7 2012,neutral,i hated that bu scene
Feb 7 2012,positive,i would fight kong for naomi watts
Feb 5 2012,positive,well i cried at the end naomi watts is a lovely intelligent actress and brody is fine in this
Feb 5 2012,positive,epic movie by an epic specialist but what shines beautifully in this film is not the sfx or the performances or kong himself but the carefully underscored and driven home message one line from the movie sums it all when driscoll says to preston carl has the unfailing ability to destroy what he loves and carl is homo sapienssapiens beautiful sad and true
Feb 4 2012,positive,good plot good action
Feb 4 2012,positive,amazing picture the scenes are breathtaking
Feb 4 2012,positive,a labor of love from peter jackson that wins in every aspect despite the three hour running time
Feb 4 2012,negative,omg this movie sucks wasted 3hrs of my life by the time they got to skull island i didnt care i just wanted it to be over
Feb 2 2012,positive,my rating is for the extended version this is an epic story that deserved an epic telling and this is it the trex scene alone rates 5 stars edit
Feb 2 2012,positive,a good movie that takes a long time to materialize anything really  but once it begins to materialize its a treat from there on out
Feb 2 2012,positive,the film manages to stay very close to the original as well as being freshly new making it feel like a new generation which is partly an example of how to make a good remake while the second part is how to stay true to the original which is why some fans seem to have a little hatred for this movie the story is pretty much the same as the very first film watching this film and the black and white film released in 1933 will we twice the real treat for those real king kong fans especially the black and white 1933 version fans as that movie no critic seemed to hate the same climatic dialogue was used in this remake and that was also great and yes andy serkis as king kong was too good but he was screwed an oscar unfortunately by the lazy academy king kong 2005 gets a 8510
Feb 2 2012,positive,update every time i see this i want to love it i always end up with the same feeling its cool enough i love the 1933 original was fascinated as a child of the 1976 jeff bridgesdino dilaurentis crapfest and love peter jackson as a filmmaker so this shouldve been a home run for me but i guess ill take the a 2run ground rule double og review anytime kong is on screen breathtaking and entertaining that big ape gorilla monkey whatever is an amazing feat however every scene not involving the king is either boring or just too long watts is gorgeous and talented black is a perfect overactor for this role but everyone else is average at best it did not need to 3 hours nor did it need an extended cut
Feb 1 2012,positive,kinda long but the special effects are good
Feb 1 2012,positive,only if its the original all the other sucked
Jan 31 2012,positive,dont remember too much saw it with cameron turnquist in theaters

Jan 31 2012,positive,solid just long could have done without the bug scene
Jan 30 2012,negative,might have worked when i was like five or something theres no way you wan take a movie seriously with jack black in it too bad for naomi and well adrien brody play a piano or something or take a hike

Jan 25 2012,positive,i think i can speek for everyone on this one way to long
Jan 25 2012,positive,the original makes me laugh this is ok but its typical with its attempted to put a more human touch into a story of a older film
Jan 25 2012,positive,brilliant vfx giving the king kong 1933 movie remake a new feel the emotions shown of king kong is extremely terrific
Jan 24 2012,positive,87 simply bumped up my score from an 85 to an 87  and i have to say to this day i still find this remake to be quite powerfully emotional the cast the music even the damn cgi and sets are just gorgeous to look at that it almost moves me to tears like those i almost had at the end of the green mile and schindlers list
Jan 24 2012,positive,great but it has its moments of pure horror
Jan 24 2012,negative,despite the technical achievement of the cgi it still fails to instill a sense  of realism  the story is also lumbered with less than inspired performances  by the cast overall but black in particular  the film is loud the action sequences  chaotic but the general effect is tedious this remake is not an improvement  upon the original
Jan 24 2012,negative,i have a lovehate relationship with this movie even though its kind of fun to watch its just simply way too long i feel as though peter jackson was on a high of directing long movies and just made this unnecessarily long and tried a little too hard to make this an epic adventure the old one is definitely better
Jan 23 2012,positive,the whole part on the islan was great but i started getting tired after that
Jan 23 2012,positive,just as good as the original
Jan 23 2012,positive,this movie made me cry the special effects were great and the storyline is just a classic

Jan 19 2012,negative,jack black was misscasted in this one could of been better
Jan 18 2012,neutral,could have gotten higher but about an hr tooo long
Jan 18 2012,negative,only because i like jack black but i didnt like this one
Jan 18 2012,positive,leave it to peter jackson to take a risk on remaking a classic but still capture the spirit of 1930s filmmaking complete with dazzling cgi
Jan 18 2012,positive,peter jackson does a great remake u felt for kong in this one
Jan 17 2012,positive,impressive but about an hour too long
Jan 17 2012,positive,a very good movie that could have been a great one if it was half an hour shorter

Jan 15 2012,positive,far too long  but the last 45 minutes is perfection

Jan 13 2012,positive,it was pretty good great effects
Jan 13 2012,positive,very awsome movie cool graphics
Jan 12 2012,positive,fantastic movie even though the runtime is hard to fathom in moments the film still amazes thanks to its breathtaking visual effects and direction thrilling action and wonderful performances from its cast especially watts
Jan 11 2012,positive,3 stars for the great cgi down fall for me i just didnt see any believable connection within the cast
Jan 11 2012,positive,this is the movie that makes me strive to be a filmmaker
Jan 11 2012,positive,a suitably chilling build up evolves into an epic with compelling visuals and stellar performances all round king kong is only le down by its length and a not as exiting as it should be ending
Jan 10 2012,positive,pretty good for a re make
Jan 10 2012,negative,saw it but didnt understand the point in the movie
Jan 10 2012,positive,nah thought it was okay
Jan 10 2012,positive,it was ok but not my tipycal type of movie

Jan 8 2012,positive,too long very difficult to take jack black seriously did i mention too long it really wasnt awful though onetime watch for sure
Jan 8 2012,negative,this movie was sprawling and way too long and im not into fantasy for fantasys sake

Jan 3 2012,negative,omigoodness the longest movie with the dumbest ending
Jan 3 2012,negative,long long story jack black was cool

Jan 2 2012,positive,a very good film indeed ticks all the boxes
Jan 2 2012,positive,have seen it great action movie although a little scary for kids
Jan 2 2012,positive,an overbudget epic that wasnt quite

Jan 1 2012,positive,try not to wet urself
Jan 1 2012,negative,this movie is really weird
Jan 1 2012,negative,too much effort to make it feel like a sweeping epoch 
Jan 1 2012,positive,b  id see it again and have  love watts black is good  brody is not good in his role too whimpy not rugged  kretschemm is good  lots of action great dino fights  did a good job of showing the true nature of the book  a love story
Jan 1 2012,negative,i sat in the front row looking up for 3 hours
Jan 1 2012,positive,thought a little of the effects were bad
Jan 1 2012,positive,totally awesome effects but it just doesnt warrant multiple viewings

Dec 30 2011,positive,i actually enjoy this film better than the original there are a lot of very good reasons i could give its betterpaced the characters are more interesting the visuals are more unique kong is actually a character not a prop but those arent my main reasons its mainly because of the badass dinosaur fights sue me
Dec 30 2011,positive,its a great remake but i feel the cast was terribly miscast jack black really
Dec 29 2011,positive,its big and exciting but the cg took me out of the action more than it should have  beautifully shot though i found the original to be more believable

Dec 28 2011,positive,pretty good if you like huge gorillas on an island loved the movie
Dec 28 2011,neutral,too long for its own good
Dec 27 2011,positive,what can you say about an ape destorying a trex in one of the most spectacular giant battles on film
Dec 27 2011,neutral,a big disappointment a long boring mess that lacked heart
Dec 27 2011,positive,when a vaudeville actress naomi watts is offered a starring role in the latest picture by a wildlife filmmaker jack black she accepts it and ends up going on the adventure of a lifetime in this adventure they arrive to an unknown island which has dangerous creatures around every corner and is home to a giant gorilla this big ape not only kidnaps the actress but it also starts to become attracted to her in peter jacksons king kong a remake of the 1933 adventure that manages to be faithful to the original version as well as add something new to the story unlike the original this version focuses more on the relationship between the ape and its captive as well as deliver some very intense suspenseful action scenes
Dec 27 2011,positive,this was a great movie love the action the special affects and everything else in it
Dec 27 2011,positive,though remakes of classic and revered films are often superfluous peter jacksons king kong proves itself to be a grandiose and extravagant visual feast with the emotional resonance that the original lacked props go to gorgeous art direction for both new york and forest scenes an excellent film that could have been done by no one other than peter jackson
Dec 26 2011,positive,fantastic special effects great movie
Dec 26 2011,positive,king kong when taken at its face value is one of the greatest monster flicks ever created led by epic visuals and action sequences coupled with perhaps the most gripping offbeat love story of all time is a sight to behold and appreciate
Dec 26 2011,positive,a very great film but way too long and that makes it very boring to watch nevertheless it is an amazing picture but not superior as the original 1933 version
Dec 26 2011,positive,i really liked this movie because it had the main points that were in the novel plus its by peter jackson director of lotr
Dec 26 2011,positive,the ending was sad 
Dec 26 2011,negative,great special effects and some exciting action scenes  but with a 3  hour running time the rest of the movie ie the attempts at building the characters left me cold at least an hour could have been cut out of this movie i only remember the action scenes and a couple of those scenes seemed to be jackson showing off saying look what i can make this ape do isnt he bad ass i just want the basic story i like the1933 kk that is a five star flick the pacing was much better in that one it didnt take the original an hour to get to the island it got straight to the story and king kong
Dec 26 2011,negative,stopped before the movie was over i really did not like it
Dec 26 2011,positive,i thought this movie was crazy and i really liked adrien brody in it
Dec 25 2011,negative,i just ended up feeling bad for adam brody he got beat out by a monkey for the girl
Dec 25 2011,positive,i still diskike the end 
Dec 25 2011,positive,not as good as i expected
Dec 25 2011,negative,the original is much better
Dec 25 2011,positive,great affects amazing plot and actors
Dec 25 2011,positive,great movie the dinosaur part was at least 45 min long

Dec 25 2011,negative,he ice skatesreally
Dec 24 2011,negative,way to long and you can miss the first hour and a half
Dec 24 2011,positive,contemporary vacuous remake  of the classic with stunning visuals
Dec 24 2011,neutral,it was a long time into the movie before even seeing the monkey
Dec 22 2011,positive,sympathizing with the beast is quite easy this movie exhibits how mankind is afraid of what they do not understand
Dec 22 2011,neutral,decent remake but cant beat the original for ingenuity of time
Dec 22 2011,positive,i absolutely love anything by peter jacksonespecially if it has naomi watts jack black and adrien brody in it
Dec 21 2011,positive,its long but its also brilliant and jack black was awesome
Dec 21 2011,positive,monstrous monumental magnificent peter jacksons dream project king kong is visually spectacular and emotionally resonant it is certainly the biggest movie of the year and possibly the biggest movie ever made
Dec 20 2011,positive,enjoyable special effects and naomi watts
Dec 20 2011,positive,looooooong but i loved it  the end made me cry probably because im a pussy
Dec 20 2011,positive,this is a great remake in fact i consider it one of the best remakes ever made the original kong is a masterpiece and this one is almost as good awesome effects good acting and emotional it may be long but its definitely worth watching  a
Dec 20 2011,positive,a little on the long side but extremely well done
Dec 20 2011,positive,almost too epic that it made me strain watching it sometimes  way too long  however definitely worth watching if you have a big screen and big sound system
Dec 19 2011,positive,reasonably good by itself however taken into account that jackson also did lotr trilogy this didnt really measured up
Dec 19 2011,positive,so much potential but the delivery just is not quite there
Dec 19 2011,positive,this is what the zenith of entertainment spectacle looks like a remake of the timeless classic jackson has done oscar work the screenplay is as original as they come a woman a mysterious island a beast naomi is the heart of the film  its driving force her emotion matters above all skull island makes jurassic park look like a petting zoo the action sequences are as bold as they come  the trex vs kong fight is truly a fight to behold there is beauty in that of a primitive beast being tendered by an innocent beauty that is the heart of the story  its tragedy usually its sacrilegious to remake a timeless classic but jackson has created  a film touted as good as event movies get
Dec 17 2011,neutral,waaaaay too long the movie is three partsbefore the island on the island and after the island the only section that works is the stuff on the island
Dec 17 2011,positive,im not going to deny that peter jacksons king kong is impressive and visually superior but its just really long and the arkward glances between monkey and watts pile up the story gets lost in the jungle for a while but eventually finds its way back its really good but not exactly great
Dec 17 2011,positive,jacksons worst movie
Dec 17 2011,positive,thought it would be better
Dec 16 2011,positive,very old fashioned in narrative which is by the way best tribute to the classic peter jacksons king kong is large than life ambition indeed i could really sense the ambition behind this hideous creature it has  thrills of spielberg movies and feel good 3 hour of cinematic journey
Dec 14 2011,positive,so funny he makes the girl fall over
Dec 14 2011,positive,loved the wrestling scene
Dec 13 2011,negative,blah  thats all i have to say  and the cgi sucked
Dec 13 2011,positive,its a shame this movie had to end 
Dec 13 2011,positive,what the  is jack black doing in a movie like this
Dec 12 2011,positive,my 3yr old loves that movie
Dec 12 2011,positive,king kong features capturing visuals particularly in the early stages with the dinosaurs the movie is entertaining overall but a bit long and overall not too memorable despite the budget and cast
Dec 11 2011,positive,good spin on a classic movie loved the interactions between king kong and the leading lady effects was good but not overwhelming a must see
Dec 11 2011,positive,king kong is a glorious remake with true special effects that without surprise won academy award for best visual effects even if peter jacksons hesitation of pace makes it exhausting to watch entirely at once jackson even put in a separate slow dancing stage act in the middle of the stage show that kong is chained to and the chatter and acting on the boat for the 1st hour arent as exhilarating as the dinosaurs and airplanes fighting kong to the death either way at least here ann felt miserably sad over kong getting killed at the end in the original she couldnt bear to be kongs bride no matter what so therefore this movie is much closer to the beauty and beast folk tale that inspired the racial interpretation americans have always looked down on interracial marriage between black males and white females
Dec 11 2011,positive,stunning visuals and a really entertaining adventure definitely much longer than it needed to be but its an impressive movie in every way its epic and showcases what movies can be when it comes to remakes
Dec 10 2011,positive,a heartfelt and admirable love letter to the 1933 classic in a sea of soulless remakes with interest in marquee value alone this movie stands out less as its own story so much as a reminder of the one that inspired it
Dec 10 2011,positive,i loved this movie it kept my attention from the beginning to the end
Dec 9 2011,positive,this is a good adaptation and very respectful towards the original although i do prefer that version
Dec 9 2011,negative,this is jack black not being able to do serious
Dec 9 2011,positive,too long good visual effects though
Dec 8 2011,positive,when the gorilla started ice skating i thought it was time to wrap it up
Dec 8 2011,neutral,it was ok 4 me but not that great
Dec 7 2011,positive,amazing blockbuster directed from the master peter jackson who returns with a full remake of special effects and set designs by fear
Dec 6 2011,negative,the reason i disliked this movie is a the fuckin gay ass bugs when they fall off of that log b it was 3 hours that could have been two hours it was a bit to long for me i loved the acting though and i still love that big ape
Dec 6 2011,positive,beautiful filmography
Dec 6 2011,positive,beautiful filmography
Dec 6 2011,positive,i thought this movie was spectacular the effects were unbelievable the story was very long but the good story decent cast and exciting scenes and moments made this a really good movie
Dec 5 2011,positive,wasnt bad wasnt great
Dec 3 2011,positive,maybe the best version since the original king kong this remake has all the charm and feeling of the original 1933 king kong
Dec 3 2011,positive,in remaking king kong peter jackson has done something incredibly impressive he not only brought more heart to the classic tale but he also did it with incredible visual style and incredible characters kong has never looked better and there is almost seamless cgi used in his creation i say almost because at times we can easily tell that the titular ape isnt really there which apart from the films gargantuan running time serves to be the only major issue it has    the story really comes in two parts the first involves a journey to a magical island that nobody has ever been to yet a film directorproducerwritercinematographer named carl denahm jack black has managed to acquire its whereabouts the studio executives have decided to scrap his latest feature yet hes determined he hires a woman off the street ann darrow naomi watts he gets his crew together on a ship thats used to capture wild animals like rhinoceros and elephants there are too many named characters to state at the moment at least four but ill try to get through them as the review goes on    first and foremost is the ships captain englehorn thomas kretschmann i liked him he had more personality than some of the other characters he also had more sense in some instances when others wanted to press on in this undiscovered island he wanted to go back and make a run for it on the high seas his first mate is a man maned ben evan parke who has a strange relationship with one of the other important members jimmy jamie bell its almost like a fatherson relationship here and it would have been nice for us to get even more depth about it    arguably the biggest name actor in the film is adrien brody who plays a writer named jack he falls for ann almost the second that he meets her and will end up playing a pivotal role when she gets captured by the 25foot gorilla spoiler alert eventually everyone ends up on the island it turns out natives live there and theyre savages they kill an unnamed member of the crew before being pumped full of bullets the crew decides to head back to the boat which is currently trapped against some rocks    in the middle of the night the savages steal ann and realize that sacrificing her to kong motion capture work done by andy serkis the titular ape he takes the sacrifice but instead of killing her like wed expect he keeps her as his pet for a while jack so in love with her decides to lead a search party out into the wilderness to rescue her carl tags along to film everything we see holding his camera closer to his chest than kong does with ann    on the island they encounter all sorts of things this island apart from the natives who stay behind a 100 foot wall has not being interacted with since the dinosaur age since apparently nothing can touch what nobody knows about dinosaurs still exist and a lot of time and effort is spent rendering all sorts of dinosaur there are also giant bugs and all sorts of other weird creatures leading to a ton of interesting interactions between them and the humans usually ending up bad for the humans    i mentioned two parts but ive only told you the first part so far thats because the second which takes up about the last 45 minutes to an hour of the film happens in a different location and has a very different tone i dont want to tell you what happens if you have no idea about king kongs story from one of the previous iterations i will say that it involves love instead of adventure and is also quite emotionally involving something i wouldnt have thought going in    when you finally see the giant creature  which id like to mention doesnt happen until around an hour in  youll probably be in awe of how incredible it looks it almost looks lifelike and the emotions that were able to be captured means its face ends up being its focal point this works well and it helps to give the monster life and a personality that you dont go in expecting to see by the end of the film you care about him just as much if not more than the humans this makes portions of the film very touching as youre wanting to see kong get his way    visually king kong is a spectacle it has amazing special effects that practically dominate every shot after the voyage to skull island begins there is always something impressive to look at in terms of the effects and this somewhat softens the films main problem its length now i dont have too much of a problem with the film taking more than three hours to tell its story as i was always entertained but i know that other audience members wont give it that much of their life    thats too bad as its just such a good film but ive talked to people who either fell asleep or turned off the film while it was playing it does take a long time to get to get going and some specific scenes could have been trimmed but overall its worth the three hours it takes to sit through    king kong is an incredible film that is worth your time i was in awe at many of the shots in this film and when put together we can an emotionally captivating film that is entertaining from start to finish with very few moments when youll be bored while it may be too long for some people i was so invested in the story that i didnt feel like i was wasting my time take that as a recommendation as im often not one to like overlong films
Dec 3 2011,neutral,a little hard to understand all of it for me it was kind of crazy
Dec 3 2011,positive,spectacular sets of the old times and great acting one of my personal favorite movies the movie has its emotional parts too an outstanding movie mustsee
Dec 2 2011,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a masterpiece and a pure example of incredible cinema  peter jackson has taken one of the most famous and respected films of all time and turned it into something extraordinary  this film has been critisized for being very long but i think the films length truly makes it feel like a real epic  this famous story is about love the love between an animal and a woman and this films beauty and grace just comes from jacksons incredible directing  his masterpiece will always be the lord of the rings trilogy but here he has shown once more the range of his talents and has made possibly the greatest film remake of all time  the script of the film perfectly sets up the characters i mean that time spent on the ship at the start really helps to get to know them and what to expect from them throughout the film  but where the film shows its true genius is when they get to the mysterious skull island where jackson uses cgi great art direction and wonderful thrills to keep us truly entertained  but i always enjoy watching the love that grows between the woman and kong because its such a warm feeling knowing the lengths the beast will go to protect her  its not just a remake its a film that enhances the old classic by truly putting us into there situation and i think thats an incredible thing  the cast is great as well i loved the performance from both naomi watts and adrien brody but i think jack black steals the show by showing us his great range of talents  as for the visual effects kong may be one of the best uses of  cgi since gollum or dobby and i think jackson really uses special effects to their best  king kong is one of my all time favorite films whenever i see this film i think of its greatness and beauty and i dont sit there and complain about its length i sit there and watch a work of art unfold
Dec 2 2011,positive,really good consideringlol
Dec 2 2011,positive,awesome special effects
Dec 1 2011,positive,it would get a higher review if it cut out about 45 minutes of useless footage

Nov 29 2011,positive,rather long rather boring
Nov 29 2011,positive,peter jackson makes the olden tale one to appreciate
Nov 29 2011,positive,king kong  dir peter jackson    whole time i kept wondering about peter jackson behind the camera coming up with ideas and giant work on biggest remake of a classic movie it is a tough job i had watched this film many years ago king kong has been rightfully and justly treated with modern cgi effects it always deserved film has beautiful setdesigning and it keeps up the pace rather artistically andy sarkis gives amazing movements for the king kong for which he had to  go and live in african jungle to learn movements of wildapes as jackson had declined pet wildape at london zoo i pretty much liked the from gatescene to ending scene of the film which holds up the taste of this celebrated film
Nov 29 2011,positive,if peter jackson can make lotr the best as they could and win oscars jackson can make king kong as good as the original and that is what i think here the cgi is good and gives the big ape a great show in modern day
Nov 28 2011,positive,this was a very good movie and is fun for all age groups
Nov 28 2011,positive,so funny and awesome
Nov 28 2011,negative,kong vs dinosaurs had my mouth like o the rest meh

Nov 22 2011,positive,crappy ending otherwise good movie
Nov 21 2011,neutral,it wasnt as epic as everyone made it out to be the acting was over dramatized graphics however were revolutionary
Nov 21 2011,positive,im not a fan of melodrama but throw some dinosaurs and a 25ft tall gorilla in there along with a timeless story and ill watch it any day
Nov 21 2011,positive,because i love animals
Nov 21 2011,positive,the film is visually almost like a revolution however because of the length most people wont appreciate this and worry about when the film ends the film does have great performances from naomi watts adrien brody and jack black but the real focus should be andy serkis who portrays as the cook and kong the infamous insect pit is very intense and may most likely disturb children or those not comfortable with bugs
Nov 20 2011,positive,this movie was a great epic adventure and i like that it was jurassic park and mighty joe young both fused together a great adventure i recommend to the kong fans you will be blown away great movie
Nov 20 2011,positive,this was good though not great the special effects were excellent
Nov 20 2011,positive,special fx are revolutionary and absoulutely outstanding the movie though drags on far too long
Nov 19 2011,positive,peter jackson and co certainly can write some schlocky dialog when they want to it would seem that jackson honed his skills at the school of hackneyeds screenwriting university sure the film becomes exciting when the troupe finally arrives on the mythical skull island but this is greatly aided in that as the action is ratcheted up the dialog is all but abandoned     as for the acting it all comes across as extremely shallow and empty of any real soul however i am not sure if one can truly blame the performers for this completely as they are not given anything close to decent for the recitation as a matter of fact that is exactly what most of the language sounds like high school drama students who are making their stage debut desperately trying to impress parents and piers alike    it would seem that all of the effort put forth by the filmmaker was focused on the titular character the great ape himself he is without a doubt a wonderful creation of vast imaginations along with a multimillion dollar budget and superior technical skill does he hold a candle to the original well its interesting i regard the original 1933 film by marion c cooper and ernest schoedsack to be one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time however it may be for different reasons than those originally intended the kong of the original film is a fully realized expressive creature which holds the movie on his own this of course is due to the magic making stop motion animation technology of the great willis obrian the man behind the beast you see while cooper and shoedsack were perhaps trying to make a much more straightforward monster picture obrian really seemed to connect with the emotion of the creature this is the reason why time after time my eyes well up as i watch that little sockpuppet tumble to his doom from atop the empire state building of which construction upon the tower had just been competed the year of this films debut     this is the main difference between coopers kong and jacksons kong  jackson came on board with a profound love for the humanity of the gorilla and was keen on displaying this as the central idea for the film cooper was at the disadvantage of not truly knowing what he had although i could hardly say that his film suffers from this in fact it is very unfair to call it a disadvantage at all cooper made the film he wanted to make and the world flocked it and still do obrian made the monster he wanted to make and the world fell in love with it and to answer my own question i really love both kongs for similar reasons although the power remains with the former and its more primitive approach to its creation this kong is quite a thrilling and heartfelt homage to that which first scaled that epic edifice of mans ingenuity and creative drive    so with a rather rushed and dull first act which seems to have come from another film completely king kong begins the long process of redeeming itself in the jungle and with the true star of the picture its not a classic and some parts are quite sloppily put together but as in most cases when the film shuts its mouth and lets us just experience it without any preconceptions of where we are going or what we are doing it works rather well
Nov 19 2011,neutral,the graphics were really good on this movie but it had a really big drawback it felt like it just continued and never ended and when you think it is near the end its only halfway through not the best production from peter jackson but oh well
Nov 18 2011,positive,a little long but good otherwise
Nov 18 2011,positive,at times i was a little bored with it but overall its a very good movie
Nov 17 2011,positive,melodramatic but effective this beast has both bite and bark  and a oftignored heart to boot
Nov 16 2011,positive,not really a fan of king kong but the effects are great

Nov 15 2011,positive,a great remake of the 1933 film

Nov 13 2011,positive,the film is flawed but looks gorgeous on bluray and just happened to be in the right mood the watch it again but still felt underwhelmed by it  wish they had tightened the script and i didnt like jack black or adrien brody in it  i actually would be okay with them rebooting this one
Nov 13 2011,positive,andy serkis is a master and peter jackson is god
Nov 13 2011,positive,not as good as the original but still a good movie and a well done remake lots of people i know dont like it and think its too long but i love it brilliant visuals and motioncapture by andy serkis a well put script and a beautiful score with a good cast some actors do seem a bit out of place though peter jacksons direction though not as good as the lotr trilogy is still top notch and weta digital did another excellent job a good movie id suggest to people as long as they dont mind long movies

Nov 8 2011,positive,great visuals fun action not much else
Nov 8 2011,positive,okay okay it probably didnt have to be three hours long the iceskating scene could have easily been cut but so what when the set pieces are this grand the effects this breathtaking and the emotion this wellhandled thats just nitpicking peter jackson truly did this timeless story justice proving yet again why hes the master of epic cinema
Nov 7 2011,positive,thank you peter jackson
Nov 6 2011,neutral,this movie was pretty good
Nov 4 2011,positive,good movie but like the original better
Nov 2 2011,neutral,i saw this ok  i guess
Nov 1 2011,positive,this remake may be one of the best ever its not another creature feature peter jackson shows more respect to the original classic then any other remake of any other movie it is as if he simply took the original and updated it with some of the most beautifully done digital effects

Oct 25 2011,positive,it was an alright film it wasnt spectacular but not terrible
Oct 24 2011,positive,emotional and visually impressive king kong is a movie that conveys a lot of emotion without any dialogue from its completely digital star it is a little excessively longer than it needs to be though 3 12 out of 4 stars
Oct 24 2011,negative,not that much of an improvement from the black  white original which i prefer still to this day  funny that
Oct 23 2011,positive,this film is a major exception to the curse of remakes if ever someone states that remakes never outdo the original i always use this masterpiece as an example with breathtaking appearances from naomi watts and adrien brody this remake of the classic wont cease to amaze you whether it be through the topclass acting or through the expensive visual effects
Oct 23 2011,positive,the 3rd best king kong film
Oct 22 2011,positive,greatest movie of that name
Oct 22 2011,negative,there are a few good moments in this movie but i found the beginning way too long for comfort im not entirely sure why everyone seems to rave over this king kong adaptation
Oct 21 2011,positive,even though it was long i still liked it
Oct 18 2011,positive,it was long but the visuals were worth sitting through
Oct 18 2011,positive,even with a running time of over 3 hours king kong manages to thrill the eyes with its visual effects and touch the hearts with its performances and skillful directing
Oct 18 2011,positive,the best of the kongs yet to be
Oct 16 2011,neutral,technically superior movie but as with all others departed so far from the actual story it was just sad
Oct 15 2011,positive,an okay monster movie granted its a three hour version of a much shorter older film this i can ignore though because you can tell the project meant a lot to peter jackson and he got the opportunity to make something cloverfield is close to my heart and if i got to make my own version of it with a virtually unlimited budget i would probably make it long too the visuals are stunning but i did find myself getting bored at one or two spots
Oct 12 2011,positive,peter jacksons dream project is packed with passion we see the humanistic gorilla come to life though a bit overly long we can really see this gorilla in all its depth though adrian brody and jack black kinda detract from this film we have nice action scenes too totally a good watch

Oct 11 2011,positive,improves upon the original in virtually every way both the effects characters and relationships given weight texture even beauty  the scenes in new york and at scene are fleshed out and better serve the characters a grounded but colorful bunch so that once we get to the thrilling set pieces we care about those involved this is one of the great modern adventure epics
Oct 11 2011,neutral,its alright i guess
Oct 9 2011,positive,top notch cgi and effects
Oct 9 2011,positive,i love the orginal king kong a lot when it came to watching the remake of a remake lol i felt that peter jackson did a great job but the begining was long and could have been shortened once they get to the island the movie is amazing from there on

Oct 7 2011,positive,it was alright i guess i mean what else can it be
Oct 7 2011,positive,jack black rarely puts on a serious face but for king kong he does deliver a graphically applauded remake of the over half a century old film
Oct 6 2011,positive,by no means the greatest movie of all time but a good one time watch had amazing acting and a real sense of the era it was set in it was a very long movie but i could not imagine any part of the movie that could be taken out hate humans once again seriously have not seen a movie lately where humans come out in a good light watch this movie once and the adventure the romance and the drama will shine through
Oct 6 2011,negative,really disliked this one over the top special effects with total disregard to physics that might be okay in a magical fantasyworld like lord of the rings but not in this one

Sep 11 2011,positive,really long but really good
Sep 10 2011,positive,rarely do we find ourselves getting so engrossed in a story that a 3 hour running time seems to have gone by far too quickly and we yearn for more
Sep 10 2011,positive,it was pretty good save for the obvious cg
Sep 7 2011,positive,a little overlong which seems to be a frequent problem with peter jackson right now but much more entertaining than return of the king
Sep 7 2011,positive,thought it was great jack black and naomi watts are awesome
Sep 6 2011,positive,peter jacksons remake of king kong was amazing and better than the original movies this movie is also must more freaky than any of the other king kongs i really liked the cast too such as naomi watts as ann the girl who was captured by king kong it was also fun to see jack black in a serious role other than most the garbage he makes adrien brody is always an excellent actor and this was one of his best roles and jamie bell was just great in this movie to for being the kid who just wanted to go on an adventure king kong is no doubt one of the greatest remakes ever
Sep 5 2011,positive,a little bit too long but none the less an epic remake    overall  a
Sep 5 2011,negative,too fake and story mixed up
Sep 4 2011,positive,peter jacksons love for the original really shines through in this epic bad ass remake of the original classic is it as good as the original not a chance but it has plenty too offer and certainly tops the 70s remake  its almost like one big homage to the original with jackson really just showcasing how far weve come with special effects since 1933
Sep 4 2011,positive,i love this movie its tied for first with jurassic park amazing
Sep 4 2011,positive,everybody loves this classic even today
Sep 3 2011,positive,either version is great
Sep 2 2011,negative,yeah we all understand this one

Aug 28 2011,negative,i actually fell asleep
Aug 28 2011,negative,i could have been so good
Aug 28 2011,positive,king kong is a terrific remake of the 1933 horror film of the same name with this remake however peter jackson makes king kong more of an action drama film than a monsterhorror film that the 1933 classic film was peter jacksons remake is a good looking picture that keeps the essence of the horror classic but reworks it to make more thrilling and exciting as the original peter jacksons king kong is a well crafted remake that successfully comes across as a good film to watch this film has surprising names attached to it jack black who i despise delivers a great performance here as carl denham the filmmaker searching for skull island naomi watts is really well suited for the classic damsel in distress role of ann darrow like i said before this remake is more action oriented this time around with little emphasis on horror elements like in the 1933 classic this envisioned film is a wonderful film but there are a few flaws as well one being that its too long and the other it has too much drama going on i mean theres nothing wrong with the drama but not when its used for over 85 of the film i felt they went overboard a bit with the drama while the original had the perfect balance of thrills and drama this remake seems try to outdo the original by doing just that making the story overly dramatic cant make it boring and at times this film is most certainly that but luckily there are plenty of high points as well peter jacksons remake is a terrific film and it has plenty of great performances but the length of the film could have slightly trimmed down if they emphasized a bit less on dramatic elements i think this could have been a shorter film but for what it is its a thrilling film that will deliver the thrills the viewer expects
Aug 27 2011,positive,peter jackson alone gets it at least 3 stars watts and brody pulled it the rest of the way
Aug 26 2011,negative,i didnt much care for this movie i like the older one prior to this one much better
Aug 26 2011,positive,a bit to long but a good movie great fight scenes when king kong bites t rexs tounge out i was like epic win go king kong your the manor ape
Aug 26 2011,positive,great splecial effects
Aug 26 2011,positive,animals are more kind than humans
Aug 25 2011,positive,added another half star  the movie truly ages very well do yourself a favor and watch the extended cut this jacksons masterpiece
Aug 25 2011,positive,very over rated and does not match up to the original and far too long but it is with no doubt entertaining
Aug 24 2011,positive,king kong showcases some of the most visually spectacular cgi ive seen and has some great performances but its sporadic action segments daydreaming calmer sections and sprawling length make it hard to follow and a bit of a bore
Aug 22 2011,positive,featuring stateoftheart special effects terrific performances and a majestic sense of spectacle peter jacksons remake of king kong is longer than it has to be
Aug 22 2011,positive,i first watched this movie when i borrowed it from a friend in 2005 when the movie was first released i was expecting quite a lot from all the hype and the film pretty much lived up to my expectations although i cannot compare it to the previous king kong films 1933 1976    the start of the film starts out in the city in which a director is trying to find appropriate people to star in and write his film he eventually finds them and takes them on the boat    the ride on the boat doesnt go exactly to plan as they land on an extremely deserted nondiscovered island and this is when trouble begins to ensue    although i wrote that in extreme short form the build up of this film actually takes a very long time which isnt surprising in an almost 3 hour film this is one of the flaws in the film it takes too long to build up and start the action    however when the action does start its awesome king kong kicks ass and the fight scenes between kong and the vrexs and other mythical beasts on the island are really cool you actually want kong to win    the character development in the film is actually very good surprisingly you will grow to like at least a couple of the characters and you will care when they get stuck into life threatening situations on the island    in conclusion the film does not have many flaws despite the extremely long probably a little too long of a build up however the awesome actions more than make up for this    id rate the film and 8 out of 10 80
Aug 21 2011,negative,though i love peter jacksons movies i didnt like this one  it had its moments but those moments were shortlived  there was so much potential a great cast and amazing special effects  unfortunately the story fell flat for me  the film spent too much time on skull island and not enough time in new york  its just too bad because i was really expecting something amazing
Aug 21 2011,neutral,i personally felt this movie was entirely too long i know thats probably been said to death but i for one couldnt wait for him to fall and the movie to end i am a huge fan of epics i can sit through a 3 hr movie with no problems if its a great movie but for some reason i couldnt stay interested in this movie ill admit there were scenes that were awesome but everything in between those scenes almost put me to sleep peter jackson can do some amazing things but he took a good 100 min movie and made it a sleeper of a 3 hr movie jackson can create a scene that can absolutely enthrall you at the same time though there was so much of this movie that could have been easily edited out king kong obviously doesnt have the story that the lord of the rings trilogy has there just isnt enough entertaining story to make a 3 hr movie out of it seemed to me that jackson was under a lot of pressure to make a huge 3 hr plus epic that he couldnt just make the movie how it needed to be made i also thought the cgi effects took the attention away from the storyline plus it looked ropey at times i was really disappointed overall and wont watch this again in a hurry
Aug 20 2011,positive,king kong is one of the best films ever made its visually stunning amazing special effects and a brilliant story this is a solid remake once the ape hits the screen its a two hour mash up of non stop action peter jackson is one of our generations greatest directors and king kong might be his best work yet this is the jaw dropping heart stopping movie epic that people have been waiting for all year
Aug 20 2011,positive,it is a fantastic movie
Aug 19 2011,positive,good points  great film amazing special effects good cast andy serkis makes king kong look great  bad points  definetly to long sure they could have edited a few bits out
Aug 17 2011,positive,peter jackson is the orson welles of fancy filmmaking
Aug 16 2011,positive,too long by an hour
Aug 16 2011,positive,i need to rewatch this
Aug 16 2011,positive,not great by any means the action is good and i like the ending when this movie was released everyone said it had fantastic graphics and when i first watched it i agreed but when i look back and watch it now it looks pretty fake cast choice annoys me

Aug 16 2011,positive,watchedinteresting film
Aug 14 2011,positive,settling into watching this version of king kong very entertaining and visual interpretation of the classic giant ape tale fun
Aug 14 2011,negative,the original king kong was one of the best and most classical examples of hollywood adventure it had chills thrills drama and romance i guess this version has all of that as well but in typical modern fashion its all amped up to 11 and every subtelty is thrown out the window instead of creative analog special effects what we get is cartoony cgi and the length jesus christ it took the original under 2 hours to tell this story but in peter jacksons hands it feels endless at just shy of 3 hours mainstream audiences will probably still find a lot to like here but i was just bored
Aug 14 2011,positive,i feel this film has many moments of brilliance some even of genius every scene has been lavished with attention and money  and perhaps it does overall somewhat suffer from jackson being allowed to do everything just so  but i think it will come to be seen as a masterpiece
Aug 13 2011,neutral,slow but interesting
Aug 13 2011,positive,this is a near perfect remake its brilliantly manages to update the orignal while paying affectionate homage to it you really believe kong and the other island creatures exsist and the relationship between the beauty and beast is more touching than any heavy handed romcom overlengthhowever is the only major flaw
Aug 13 2011,positive,one of my all time faves 
Aug 13 2011,positive,this almost 3 hour movie is a good but it drags at times
Aug 12 2011,positive,everything i want out of an epic movie not perfect but close enough
Aug 12 2011,positive,very good movie  i got it on blu ray 
Aug 11 2011,positive,when i saw this in theaters i enjoyed it but i wasnt overly impressed rewatching it has caused me to be more favourably disposed towards it however
Aug 11 2011,positive,only 57 percent of the audience liked this no king kong is a wonderful followup after the lord of the rings trilogy mesmerizing effects fine acting by a wellchosen cast and a solid but lengthy script pack a knockout for this epic
Aug 11 2011,negative,jack black awesome as ever
Aug 10 2011,positive,scared the crap out of me when i first saw it at age 11
Aug 10 2011,positive,loveemotions speak no language 
Aug 10 2011,negative,dont get me wrong i rate giant apes fighting trexs its just i cant take jack black seriously in a role
Aug 10 2011,negative,visually magnificent but lacks sense of drama and personal connection
Aug 9 2011,positive,the best king kong movie without a doubt featuring a great cast and visually striking special effects this movie is 3 hours of entertaining action that people cant miss this compares with other peter jackson movies like lord of the rings this also features jack black in a different kind of role for him in which he does a surprisingly good job
Aug 9 2011,positive,its opening act is a bit drawn out but the action and emotional appeal more than make up for it
Aug 8 2011,positive,is sweet when king kong knew her
Aug 7 2011,positive,beauty dun kilt the beast i recon
Aug 7 2011,positive,i thought this was very well done everything from the performances to the beautiful set pieces had me
Aug 7 2011,positive,despite its daunting runtime this movie improved a lot of what i didnt really care for in the 1933 original  the effects are obviously better overall really impressive cgi the characters seem to be reasonably welldeveloped and the beauty and the beast element was there but very much downplayed  i thought the natives were outstandingly creepy but i was a little disappointed jackson wanted to spend more time running around the island chasing the monkey rather than drawing the audience in to the eerie folklore surrounding it  the writing was really sosonot eyerollingly cheesy but not exactly aweinspiring either  certainly watchable but if a classic story needs 3 hours to retell i want something new and i didnt really get it here  its big its bold its visualbut thats about it

Aug 6 2011,negative,a glorified videogame demo reel with a beautiful live actress
Aug 5 2011,positive,the original king kong back to action with a lot of action nd the great kong going ravadge
Aug 4 2011,positive,pretty good adaption to the original not sure jack black was the right choice in this movie but an interesting flick non the less

Aug 2 2011,negative,really pisses me off that kong has to die
Aug 2 2011,positive,beauty killed the beast
Aug 1 2011,positive,nice movie especially for a gorilla
Aug 1 2011,positive,peter jacksons king kong is a masterpiecei remember seeing this in theaters and being amazed on how exciting and masterful this film wasthe special effects in this are astonishingi really loved the story what makes the movie really work is you get the know all the characters before they set foot on skull islandeven in the so called slow parts the movie was still had this great pacethe creatures in this film are like inspired by jules verne and even lord of the ringsthe action is really well crafted i was on the edge of my seat everytimethe cast was perfect jack black did a great job as really persistant movie directoradrien brody and naomi watts were also really good as wellheck even king kong had some heart and character in him for a cgi monstermichael bayi have to say i enjoyed this more than lord of the ringsking kong was that good of a film and reimagining of a classic film
Aug 1 2011,positive,i enjoy the mix with dinossaurs
Jul 31 2011,positive,there is no possible way to make a better remake than this film  after all of the lord of the rings films peter jackson creates a wonderful masterpiece of action romance and drama
Jul 31 2011,positive,if the first half was shorter it would have been amazing
Jul 31 2011,neutral,wen on a bit to long
Jul 31 2011,neutral,im still  iffy about this movie
Jul 31 2011,positive,one of the best films of the year
Jul 30 2011,neutral,bloated and uneven  updating a classic to be more grandiose and getting the right director for the job in peter jackson where could this all go wrong  before i go off on the myriad of problems i have with this movie ill start with the good the special effects look great and you can really see where the 207 million dollars went  peter jacksons camera work is always top notch and there are two really great and memorable spectacle sequences so if nothing else you have that once youve walked away from the movie  that said the worthwhile spectacle is twenty maybe twentyfive minutes  this is a three hour long movie and one that has a lot of fat that could have been trimmed off of it which would make it less of a chore to watch  the inflated runtime may have bothered me less if one of two things had happened 1 if it was less jarring whenever they downshifted from action and destruction to tender romance between king kong and naomi watts  it is what makes up the entire third act and that is not the way to handle your climax andor 2 if these characters had more dimension  adrien brody was the only one that breathed any depth into his character  watts is a fully capable actress but the only thing she is given to do is to play damsel in distress with stockholm syndrome and that brings us to jack black  i think he does as good of a job as he is capable of doing but hes so far out of his league he sticks out like fractured thumb hes not a good fit for the role especially one this epic  he can be good when used properly like in a high fidelity or a kung fu panda but when you look at him you dont see a character you see jack black  theres never reason enough to care and subsequently you never get that sense of wonder that you would like to get out of it  when you account for how great this movie looks it just makes it that much more disappointing that it misses the mark
Jul 30 2011,positive,when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be amazing and it was peter jackson does a great job setting the moodof the story some of the script is sorta cheesy but other times it was very well put together there is no way its as good as king kong 1933 but its great to see that king kong will still be remembered as one of the greatest monster of all time
Jul 28 2011,positive,its uneven pace mostly at the beginning bothers a little too much to ignore it however all goes down with the introduction of a brilliantly conceived creature and a brilliantly casted beauty theres no way of denying it
Jul 28 2011,positive,gorgeous film  incredible effects  jack black 3
Jul 28 2011,neutral,like it has been a long time since ive seen it
Jul 28 2011,positive,jack black plays a completely different roll from his normal genre and nails it
Jul 27 2011,positive,the original was better
Jul 27 2011,neutral,to long to get to the good parts
Jul 27 2011,positive,amazing adventure and spectacular scene
Jul 26 2011,positive,its not as great as lotr series but yes its nice to see to those who havent seen original king kong if you have seen it you wont be disappointed either
Jul 26 2011,positive,this is one crazy action fantasy adventure epic
Jul 26 2011,positive,i was so young when i watched it and i had decided to marry a gorilla
Jul 26 2011,negative,not a bad film well made but not really my sort of thing
Jul 25 2011,positive,this movie was action packed but i thought it didnt have all of it
Jul 25 2011,positive,really enjoyed this film very well made and the story was good
Jul 25 2011,positive,this perfectly executed movie along with its good cast does not bore you at all
Jul 25 2011,positive,this movie gives a lesson to those people whos movies use excessive vfx it proves that you can use as many amount of vfx as much you can but the story should not get compromised at the sack of vfx
Jul 24 2011,positive,a monster epicgreat old fashioned entertainment
Jul 23 2011,positive,surprisingly great although id expect nothing less from peter jackson hell id be content with him directing a legend of zelda movie king kong is 3 hours long but it carries you masterfully through all the bloodlust and tragedy
Jul 23 2011,positive,an action packed adventure that will keep your attention for three hours
Jul 23 2011,positive,jack black impressed me hoe he can do serious parts although hes more a comedic actos
Jul 23 2011,positive,peter jacksons vision  of king kong is more epic passionate and unforgettable than the original
Jul 23 2011,negative,this makes me cry 
Jul 22 2011,positive,from the original thru to the updated fun
Jul 22 2011,positive,better than the original
Jul 21 2011,positive,not as good as the original but i had a ton of fun with it
Jul 21 2011,positive,not as good as the original but decent
Jul 21 2011,positive,dont really remember much but they probably needed better actors if i dont remember
Jul 20 2011,positive,if you were peter jackson and had finished the lord of the rings trilogy what would your follow up project have been  i cant personally think of another movie that has the potential to be as big as lotr but perhaps the shadow of the epic trilogy was not the place for king kong to try to start from  this certainly isnt a bad film but its not as good as i think it had the potential to be  the visuals and the scale both feel epic and the overall design of the locations both america and skull island are beautifully realised and a joy to look at  the pacing is on the slow side and the film can drag in spots and the film runs on a little too long for my liking  cast performances are largely good but i found jack black a little diificult to take at certain points in the film  the scenes between naomi watts anne and kong himself portrayed by andy serkis are probably some of the most effective and most touching in the film  a good adventure film with fantastic visuals and some amazing action sequences and a few touching ones as well but probably could have benefitted from some additional trimming in running time and a couple different casting choices  recommended for those looking for a visually impressive adventure film that may impress at some points but also may bore at others  and those who have a strong bladder
Jul 20 2011,positive,i must say that this moive is full of espectacular effects its just plain beautiful peter jackson couldnt have made it more beautiful it is even better than the original it thrills your emotions larger than the original but the time you spend watching the movie is worthy
Jul 19 2011,positive,a sad movie not a favorite but very emotional
Jul 19 2011,negative,couldve been wayy better
Jul 18 2011,positive,i liked it couldnt be any better
Jul 17 2011,positive,peter jackson does a well job of bringing this 1930s classic to modern times my only complaint is that you cant take jack black seriously in any film
Jul 17 2011,neutral,great graphics but mediocre acting
Jul 17 2011,positive,jackson is a genius nice adventure movie with a lot action and special effects it has sth of jurassic park and indiana jones and very nice actors like watts brody or black one of the best movie in 2005
Jul 17 2011,positive,this film is perfect in every way they could change nothing about it to make it better  best actor adrien brody
Jul 17 2011,positive,terrific visual effects all around but isnt 3 hours too long especially when the original was less than 2 hours long
Jul 17 2011,positive,uhmmmnnnnnwell i love it too
Jul 16 2011,positive,i really like this movie it was a great remake and epic although i kinda thought it was overlong it just had so many scenes that could have been cut but i still liked it  grade  a

Jul 12 2011,positive,it is very long but its possibly better than the original which is rare in adaptions andy serkis facial expressions as king kong are astonishing he should have won an award of some kind for his performance as king king its simply stunning

Jul 9 2011,positive,fantastic visual experience better than expected jackson has put a lot of effort in producing this remake of his favorite film

Jul 7 2011,positive,its a nice movie but its not really that intererting
Jul 7 2011,positive,cant watch it i cry every time kong dies
Jul 7 2011,positive,a directors vision of the complete epic visually and narratively grand movies dont come much bigger than this it may not be as good as the orginal or may be as some people claim but there are no faults with jacksons version absolute masterpiece the best film of 2005 and a serious contender for film of the decade
Jul 5 2011,positive,the 1934 version and the 2005 version are gr8
Jul 5 2011,positive,the end of this movie made me cry like a little girl the cg affects on the gorilla as it dies and then falls from the empire state building are just heartrending great retelling of a classic monster tale loved it
Jul 3 2011,positive,while king kong isnt the kind of movie thats really really good its still better than most remakes these days i had several problems with  it though most notably of which was the length three hours really and slow pacing the cg use of kong himself was obvious and disconcerting to say the least it was good when the film first came out but not as much these days kongs clear attraction to female protagonist naomi watts can you really blame him also got on my nerves for some reason jealousy most likely i really liked the dinosaur sequences and the trench with all the awesome bugs overall the film was good but it has far too many little problems for me to think of it as great
Jul 3 2011,positive,too fake at times and very long i saw this on the big screen but it has no impact at home the film is way too long and no where near the spectacle of the original
Jul 3 2011,negative,i am a fan of jack black and adrien brody but pairing them with a giant cgi ape was too much i was asleep halfway thought the movie and was only glad to leave the theater when it was over
Jul 3 2011,neutral,good movie but dont watch it with my mother and brother if you dont enjoy commentary
Jul 2 2011,negative,ugh really mr jackson
Jul 2 2011,positive,this is a summer action movie drama action romance and comedy tightly wrapped in a spectacular pool of special effects emotion and imagery a movie of true epic proportions
Jul 2 2011,positive,jack black was not the best person for that role nonetheless spectacular visuals and mostly solid performances

Jun 26 2011,positive,the dinosaurs surprised me
Jun 26 2011,positive,this 3 hour modern masterpiece upholds the original by honoring the technology that the original wished for
Jun 25 2011,positive,for some unknown reason this remake is almost universally loathed the cast the effects and the direction are all top notch my only problem is that the movie drags on way too long and in the process causes you not to really care about the relationship between naomi watts and adam brody
Jun 24 2011,positive,never watched the ending
Jun 24 2011,negative,ok movie black dost bring anything new to the movie

Jun 22 2011,positive,jack black doesnt do well playing a serious guy but still epic ending
Jun 21 2011,positive,kks success rides on one thing if youre convinced with the cgi monkeys acting if yes its a fairly solid film if no youll probably hate it    considering the films silly premise and the fact that its a remake this is far from a failure it has all the necessary action thrills and laughs with adequate emotion to place on    the art direction is gritty yet fantastical if theres one complaint its the ridiculously overplayed ending and the fact that the entire supporting cast is thrown out the window by the final act
Jun 21 2011,positive,lengthy thrill ride with gorgeous cinematics
Jun 20 2011,positive,best thing about this moviejack black worst thing about this movieeverything else
Jun 20 2011,positive,pete jackson tried to turn king kong into an epic the thing is its not that epic just really really long i actually slept away in the cinema really
Jun 20 2011,positive,up there as one of the best remakes retains all emotion and amazingly enough innovation from the original one jacksons vision is always breathtaking
Jun 20 2011,positive,good plot and graphics for 2005 i think that this movie should be investigated by parents first because of the nonstop creature violence and constant disturbing images that were displayed during the first second and last parts of the movie
Jun 18 2011,positive,it was beauty that killed the best
Jun 18 2011,positive,in an age where every original film is remade within fifteen to twenty years it seems surprising that certain remakes especially those of timeless classics can still deliver in quality and exhilaration even originality it takes a director who knows exactly what they want like peter jackson a cast who submerges themselves in the roles entirely naomi watts jack black adrian brody and above all else spectacular filmmaking that truly glorifies the meaning of the film as a whole this remake is definitely jacksons paid homage to the original as can be seen in his intricate camerawork and gorgeous cinematography every frame is like a magnificent portrait almost a picture book that moves flawlessly even in the rockiest of scenes such as the unforgettable kong vs trex scene or the enormous bug scene which is so fantastically squeamish that it is almost unbearable to watch true filmmaking at its highest the cgi is about as good as it gets in this game but not so much that it takes away from the reality in fact the strongest feature of king kong is that it represents a film that truly fulfills the expectations of escapism which is a key priority of cinema that is oftentimes ignored naomi watts is more and more becoming the actress of my generation i have yet to see her in a film where she is not absolutely perfectly fitted for the role and i think that is because of her ability to connect wholeheartedly with the characters you fall in love with her almost as hard as the ape does within the first thirty minutes jack black is a surprising successhis strict determination and ultimate foolishness are captured in a way that doesnt create as much of a comedic character as it does a flawed ignorant one which is exactly the role he is supposed to be playing lastly brody is just as heroic and exceptional as always the perfect hero to rescue the character played by watts what kong delivers is a modern epic one that we have all seen or heard before but delivered in an entirely new tothetimes way its lengthy runtime may sway some but watching it in its entirety really satisfies the purpose of a motion picture
Jun 18 2011,positive,great movie  pity that kong dies at the end
Jun 18 2011,positive,echoing rt king kong is visually spectacular and emotionally resonant
Jun 18 2011,positive,a brilliant remake that took the old story and made it feel fresh what with skull island being more of a threat with adding dinosaurs and weird creatures to make the film feel more dangerous although the effects were good most of the time there was a few scenes were you could tell were done behind a green screen and they looked pretty bad kong looked pretty good too my main problem was it was too long and it takes an hour for the cast to even get to skull island apart from the length and a few poor scenes with the green screen its still a great remake
Jun 17 2011,neutral,in reality giant primates are probably more affectionate than most men
Jun 17 2011,negative,hello my dear    my name is miss gift bernarda tall good looking young girlso lovely and caring with good understandingfair in complexioncare with good sharinghonestyi saw your profile at which interested me much and i decided to contact youi really want to have a good friendship with you even if you have married we can be friends i have a reason of selecting you as my friendplease if you wish to know moreplease contact me through this my email address ok giftbaby4bernardyahoofr we need to talk and know our self more and equally share pictures to each otherhope to hear from you  please reply me with my email address here giftbaby4bernardyahoofr  yours new friend  miss gift bernard  thanks
Jun 16 2011,positive,i love the old movies king kong was probably one f the best
Jun 15 2011,positive,my favorite and in my opinion the superior kong picture the cast was great though brodys character was pretty bland and some of the cast and their relationships felt unnecessary and added unneeded length to the film and not much else take jimmy and captain hayes for example the movie was also overdramatic full of slowmotion that wasnt needed examples being the scenes where the natives attacked the crew when carl is telling jack about skull island and when the crews exploring the island i also feel like the film may have had too much action i mean it was well done and all but it seemed like every single scene with the crew after anns kidnapping has them either running away from or fighting off hordes of dinosaurs or giant insects just gets a bit tiring after awhile you know but those are the only complaints that come to mind overall a really good version i dont think peter jacksons take on the eight wonder of the world will be outdone any time soon
Jun 15 2011,positive,oh my i love horrors  one of my favorites
Jun 14 2011,positive,very good ideas and scary large bugs
Jun 14 2011,positive,really good better then 1933 version
Jun 14 2011,positive,my fav version but really long
Jun 14 2011,positive,this is a good film by peter jackson but why is his movies always so long
Jun 14 2011,positive,a great epic film of lovethough it is a more than a bit over long
Jun 14 2011,negative,soooooooo long and not that good if the movie had a faster pace and was half as long itd be much better the acting and the graphicscg were good but the movie was not for me
Jun 14 2011,negative,i thought it was kinda boring
Jun 14 2011,positive,king kong could have certainly been better and shorterill give that outrage to peter jackson since he also directed the lord of the rings
Jun 13 2011,positive,carl denham im finished   jack driscoll how did you think this would end carl     the eighth wonder of the world    king kong is a spectacular remake of the beloved classic peter jacksons king kong is his best work along side the lord of the rings trilogy this move has a tremendous story and cast along with beautiful special effects and of course the beast himself king kong king kong is a sure classic in the making and one of the best remakes ever once you get past that painfully slow first act its one thrilling ride
Jun 13 2011,positive,the only criticism i have ever seen for this movie is about its length which is a little over 3 hours i could care less the longer the better i found no problems with this film   now if they will just remake king kong vs godzilla i will be a happy camper 
Jun 12 2011,positive,entertaining but i still prefer the original
Jun 12 2011,neutral,meh  worth a watch  one
Jun 12 2011,negative,just six years after its inception this movie is completely obsolete   i walked in on a friend who was watching it and didnt know what it was as i had never seen it before i thought it was some horrible b movie it was funny when i realized it was king kong and remembered the positive reviews i was a bit puzzled
Jun 12 2011,positive,in the beginning of  this movie i was pretty scared but it was kind of a fun ride the rest of the way
Jun 11 2011,positive,i honestly dont get why so many people hate this movie
Jun 11 2011,neutral,giant ape falls for dumb blonde and pays the price where jackson triumphs in lotr he patently fails to deliver in this his dream project nice looking but over indulgent well conceived but unconvincing ultimately poorly developed characters and a linear plot line fail to satisfy effects are well done but frequently excessive and drawn out as in the ridiculous dinosaur stampede cant help feeling spielberg would have pulled it off 10 times better
Jun 11 2011,negative,good idea but a bad remake  bad casting too
Jun 11 2011,positive,i remembered watching this as a 7 year old i loved the film although it had a very slow start but the thing is we rarely get to connect with the humans in a kaijumonster movie i get the sense of care or worry about kong and the main characters which is very rare when i watch these types of movies overall the visuals are stunning acting is great score is very well made and the cinematography was amazing oh and probably one of the best remakes out there
Jun 10 2011,positive,the actions are awesome  kingkong y
Jun 10 2011,positive,a blockbuster with impressive visual effects and a good story with it but a little bit too long 30mn less would let us a very very good piece
Jun 9 2011,positive,king kong was nothing short if epic
Jun 9 2011,positive,an amazing and sad movie i loved the plot and story line the actors where great so were the animations and the effects i would recommend this to everyone
Jun 8 2011,positive,certainly better than the jeff bridges 70s remake but far to long in the tooth and taking itsself very seriously at times when its really not required jack black still was a bad casting choice in my opinion  it should have been an actor who was far better at 1 acting 2 acting out obsessive behavior convincingly
Jun 8 2011,positive,too long but really good 
Jun 7 2011,positive,it was a good remake as far as visuals go but the movie was way to long for me
Jun 6 2011,positive,suceeds where the original failed creating a well done love triangle beauty and the beast theme
Jun 5 2011,positive,my favourite peter jacksons film
Jun 5 2011,positive,this version of king kong is a beautifully crafted and amazingly acted movie that will stand as one greatest films of all time and is a great tribute to the original kong
Jun 5 2011,negative,this film was really moving my bowels
Jun 4 2011,negative,this grimmer uglier and painfully longer retelling of the classic tale is more interested in making the effects look bigger than actually making the story seem richer for a remake i felt that it was disappointing
Jun 4 2011,positive,interesting watched this when i was very little
Jun 3 2011,positive,big fan of mr brody  also jamie bell is quite the actor
Jun 3 2011,positive,while too long for its own good this is still a good film  this movie takes justices from the original and takes a different path to them however some scenes can drag and some of the characters arent very interesting  other than that this is still a good film
Jun 3 2011,positive,there are some great suspenseful moments and is quite emotional at the end but i found it to be a bit boring i love kongs entrance thought
Jun 3 2011,positive,still looks like a mondey to me
Jun 3 2011,positive,peter jackson did the impossible and improved on the original films story by making the story less about kongs obsession with ann and more of a doomed platonic lover affair which adds extra resonance to the films ending the film is an excellent adventure but a dark one not a lighthearted indiana jones adventure like the first pj script so it wont appeal to everyone and it may be too intense for some children the fx are stellar in every scene except the bronto chase and kong really seems alive thanks to andy serkis superb motion captured performance i cant wait to see him in rise of the planet of the apes as ceaser
Jun 3 2011,positive,and the frightening audacious violence of the original king kong is reined in considerably when it comes to chomping on humans kongs bestiality is more indicated than shown lots of quick cutaways shockingly with a budget fourhundred times greater than the original the cgieffects are just adequate and at times they fail utterly as in the protracted brontosaurus stampede in one scene as kong is chasing driscoll adrian brody through a narrow new york alley the creature steps out onto the sidewalk and his leg appears to pass right through a scrambling pedestrian also in the frenzied trexkong battle or even as kong travels swiftly with ann to his mountain lair the decision to have point of view shots from anns perspective or to whip the camera around to heighten the fury of clashing giants actually reduces the terror while increasing a sense of visual vertigoinducing confusion in early interviews jackson said he wasnt interested in any sexual byplay but was looking for a more emotional relationship between ann and kong this is another misstep what is more redolent with emotion than a sexual encounter where the film succeeds is in the opening scenes with a highly evocative depressionera new york establishing the identities of the characters who are all for the most part greatly improved a big exception jack driscoll a rugged if wooden heman in the original is turned into an effete playwright and acted with an incongruous sheepish gravity by mr brody and unexpected thrills the single most terrifying moment comes as the tramp steamer venture enters skull islands treacherous shallow waters due to humor and wit think of ann and kong on the ice the film is engaging but it strains to convey the heartfelt bond between beast and blonde it wanted to show so desperately
Jun 3 2011,positive,visually spectacular and emotional though it is rather drawn out
Jun 3 2011,positive,the original 1933 kong is my favorite movie ever and none of the other movies of the franchise have ever lived up to it but this is the best since the original i felt like reviewing all the king kong movies when i signed up for rotten tomatoes and now im doing my final kong review  this movie was great this movie is visually amazing  incredibly exciting its filled with adrenaline pumping action  is a lot of fun its more emotionally resonant then youd expect  once again shows the storytelling techniques that peter jackson has very underrated in my opinion i love this film
Jun 2 2011,positive,one the best remakes peter jackson has done a great job
Jun 2 2011,neutral,drawn out and predictable
Jun 2 2011,positive,a little bit too much he could have cut some scenes that were too long    but naomi is always naomi extra 10 for her
Jun 2 2011,positive,amazing film   nof said
Jun 1 2011,positive,another lengthy masterpiece to add to peter jacksons masterful collection of films king kong is epic
Jun 1 2011,negative,im not sure how this is one of the best remake ever great visually with lot of predictable scenes thats it
Jun 1 2011,positive,good special effects and lots of action
Jun 1 2011,positive,a masterful retelling of the 1933 classic told by landmark filmmaker peter jackson with spectacular results
Jun 1 2011,positive,pretty much the best remake ever
Jun 1 2011,positive,peter jackson was wise not to reveal king kong too early showing us a stunning recreation of an early new york instead while taking his time setting up the characters several of the dinosaur scenes become a bit plodding but the end is spectacular
Jun 1 2011,positive,its a little long but still worth watching
May 31 2011,positive,absolutely love this film still get sad at the end just like i did with the original 1933
May 31 2011,positive,king kong is a masterful example of what a bigbudget spectacle can amount to if constructed with the highest care and an astounding sense of vision rather than being another mindless excursion out to the heap of cynicallyminded scars on the cinemalandscape  that too frequently take the form of the bigbudget summer action movie king kong combines all of the enjoyment and excitement typically associated with the best summer action movies with the tenderness and thoughtfulness of a highclass drama make no mistake about it peter jackson who considers this something of a dream project has crafted a film on par with his lord of the rings trilogy    the basic story of king kong is a fairly typical beauty and the beast story it is almost exactly the same as in the original 1933 picture with only slight differences in the overall arc of the story carl denham jack black looking to make a fortune on a new idea for a movie recruits ann darrow naomi watts to be his leading lady initially reluctant she signs on once learning that jack driscoll adrien brody has signed on to write the screenplay in order to film this movie they venture to the mythical skull island which carl has received a map of and believes to be the perfect location for an adventure film once there however ann is kidnapped by natives and given as a sacrifice to the gargantuan although not nearly as large as in previous versions of the film kong as jack and other crewmen begin to search for ann and the anxious director searches for opportunities both on film and off to make his fortune ann and the beast begin to form something of a relationship with kong being quite taken by her beauty    where this film succeeds and so few films with this kind of budget fail is in the emotions depicted on film even moreso than in the original kong a masterpiece in its own right jackson ensures that the examination of the relationship between the titular character and ms darrow is carefully and intricately displayed on screen while it wont beat out the greatest onscreen romances this is a truly breathtaking example of how a summer blockbuster even though this is came out in december is enhanced by fully developed characters and a forceful emotional component to match the special effects which are topnotch here but more on that later it is nice here to see the romance develop in a realistic manner as initially neither kong nor the human he is attracted to seem to know what to make of each other ms darrow is worried but she doesnt back down and she has to work to gain kongs support by putting on an improvised vaudeville her profession show to entertain the creature kong becomes initially attracted whereas ms darrow remains more conflicted as to her opinion of kong     what was most initially apparent from the trailers and other advertising for the movie is that the special effects are topnotch in every facet kong is possibly the most realistic cg character ever put to screen the whole film looks beautiful and is naturally occurring on a grand scale but it is the intricacies of the cg that really add to the quality of the experience the most kong himself for example is most impressive in the facial area the work done to ensure that his face is capable of displaying a wide array of realistic emotions is phenomenal and it pays off entirely without ever uttering a word we are able to understand exactly what kong is thinking due to his facial expressions and it makes the character all the more compelling     for those looking simply for the grand spectacle there a number of big action scenes to excite and entertain although more restless viewers may struggle to get past the first hour of the movie which is decidedly kong free the first is a stampede of brontosaurus brought on by an attack of what i assume is  a pack of velociraptors that the crew of the film happen to be caught up in and it left me thinking that there was no way the film could top such an exhilarating scene however the film later went on to prove me wrong with what is easily the centerpiece of the film from an adrenaline standpoint a battle between kong and three dinosaurs which evolved from t rexs and act in a similar fashion this battle is not only phenomenally directed and truly exhilarating but it shows to what extent kong is willing to go to save ann from harm     on the performance side adrien brody is solid as jack driscoll delivering the appropriate mix of shyness and competent valor necessary to make jack a relatable everyman hero jack black doesnt fare quite as well although he does deliver well enough when the audience is supposed to believe that he is essentially a selfish scumbag when his character is trying to convey that he means well and is looking out for the good of his crew though he is less successful as the character often has this smirk on his face that makes it seem as though he is at the very least lightly fibbing to everyone else naomi watts who is required to display the most range in her performance gives the best performance out of the three due to her we are able to connect with ann and understand why she feels as she does about kong her performance is wisely underplayed although she sure can scream when it is called for and she gives us a female lead who is competent and assured yet vulnerable     one could make the argument that kong is too long at over three hours but every scene in the later two thirds serves a purpose advancing either one of the characters or displaying the appropriate spectacle necessary to convey the location to the audience and to enhance the atmosphere the first third could potentially have been trimmed but it by no means affects the quality of the film as the scenes do still serve a purpose and are necessary to develop the initial relationships between the characters so that the later portions of the movie are meaningful     king kong is one of the best summer blockbusters of the past decade it is a sight to behold being visually stunning in every regard but it also contains an emotional component that is unfortunately lacking in almost every other movie that is this big in terms of scale this is unfortunate but it enhances kong if anything lending it an air of resonance and impact that has brought me back to it whereas other spectacles have long left me out in the cold    rating 9010
May 31 2011,positive,its cool and all but its almost about love not really that much action
May 31 2011,positive,not a necessary remake but i had a good time with it probably could have been edited down to about two hours though
May 31 2011,positive,a little or a lot long but just phenomenal
May 31 2011,positive,the only thing that blew me away about this movie was how long it was  jack black stick to comedy
May 30 2011,positive,the beginning is fairly long and slow but once your on the island or in the streets of new york you realize that peter jackson has successfully recreated one of the greatest monster movies ever
May 30 2011,positive,loved it it made me cry at some points and was nice and scary but not really scary the only thing that dissapointed me was that ann was hideous haha oh well it was good
May 30 2011,neutral,boring but had some good parts
May 29 2011,positive,overrated completely but skip the first hour and its a great film
May 28 2011,positive,a remake that is amazingly better then the original this is a visual achievement of a movie a
May 27 2011,positive,jackson really should have focused on the hobbit movie instead
May 26 2011,positive,i really like this remake of this movie
May 25 2011,positive,great movie actors and directing is great
May 23 2011,positive,probably one of the best remakes ever conceived a film that doesnt try too hard to be different from its predecessor and yet doesnt insultingly rehash the same film with a larger budget like gus van sants psycho it respects the original and has enough selfrespect to stand up for itself
May 23 2011,negative,i absolutely hated this movie
May 23 2011,positive,cried all the way through and when he did beautiful that was it
May 22 2011,positive,i really liked this film   i remember watching the original with my pops and i fell in love with the big fella then  love the adventure it takes fans on  jackson is the man

May 21 2011,positive,ture love really a moving move
May 20 2011,positive,a good tribute to the classic 1933 epic but not as pioneering and far too long
May 19 2011,positive,great film with even better special effecs
May 19 2011,positive,very good action movie
May 19 2011,positive,a solid cast dazzling special effects and a giant badass and also sweet ape make this movie an enjoyable piece of filmmaking    its not by far better than the original but this remake manages to deliver some heartpounding scenes which are visually amazing and benefits from the perfomances of naomi watts jack black and adrien brody
May 19 2011,positive,the 1st king hong was nice the 2nd was a little better
May 18 2011,positive,after directing the lord of the rings trilogy director peter jackson went on to direct a fresh remake of the 1933 classic king kong  his favorite movie hed pointed out before a director in that position doing such project would use his knowledge of the original to his own vision with a required faithfulness well it seems jackson did that with his own kind of visually epical scale and the result is that his usual visual spectacle made this monster adventure flick work with some added pathos probably a usual element thatd appeared in monster flicks that the original lacked and good performances from the cast seemingly at their best probably    it may not reach the same level of the lord of the rings but peter jacksons king kong is the mighty of the incarnations of the giant ape especially improving the style of the original that started it all b    full review coming soon
May 15 2011,positive,with added scope and depth to its story and characters jacksons take on kong is as perfect a remake as one could ask for paying respect to the original while updating the asthetics for a modern audience
May 15 2011,positive,the t rex owns this film and of course naomi watts 
May 15 2011,positive,thats a huge bch
May 14 2011,negative,boring jack black needs to stick with comedy

May 14 2011,positive,very good remake some parts are better than the original other parts not as good
May 13 2011,positive,i cried literally rolling water down my checks i connected with the king kong and naomi watts so much that i felt what they felt the movie was epic fantastic and excellent directing cinematography effects  and acting i must admit the beginning could have been cut shorter to get into the heart of the movie or half an hour could have been cut but that was its only downfall even though most know the story of king kong and his faith i was begging the director to change his mind and rewrite the scripts hoping in my mind somehow at the end king kong would make it through thats how engulfed i was with this film i felt excitement laughter thrills sadness and just pure entertainment while watching this this is truly and epic movie please do you self a favor and go and watch this masterpiece
May 11 2011,positive,pretty good but too long
May 11 2011,negative,jack black miscasttoo many bugsso so

May 10 2011,positive,a good remake of the 1933 original but im more of a classics guy
May 10 2011,negative,the worst movie i ever seen
May 9 2011,positive,if you can ignore how long this movie is you will quickly realize how it is possibly one of the greatest films of all time maybe not as good as the original which i admit i have not seen but pretty darn good    the only negative i can think of is that its so darn long in the 1st hour of the movie it seems like more of a romantic comedy this might turn off most people with good taste in movies but i guarantee it gets better but be aware of the longevity before you see it    the acting was phenomanal some people were angry with jack blacks preformance as carl denham but i actually quite liked it it was realistic deep and sometimes even emotional naomi watts after seeing this movie is a recent addition to my greatest actresses of all time she did a fantatsic deep job as ann darrow adrien brody was fantastic too definatley the right choice for jack    of course the special affects were amazing kong was as realistic as it gets and i heard it took years to get his appearence right thumbs up to peter jackson on kong    the relationship between kong and ann which was weird and uncomfortable in the 1970s remake is actually emotional in this one they obviously arent in love with each other that would be disturbing but they are good friends and we care when kong is killed at the end    the fight scene between the vrex and kong was great one of the best out there better than anything michael bay did in transformers    overrall this is quite possibly the greatest remake ever i reccomend it only to very very patient movie watchers

May 9 2011,neutral,great visuals dull story and acting

May 8 2011,positive,the film shows  and represents the feelings of human and beastsa vicious and ambitious director sets of with his crew and joblessyoung and beautiful actress ann to skull island  a dangerous and dreadfull place where dinosaurs  natives and king of beasts kong live and fight for survivalthroughout the movie we watch the love story between the screenwriter jack and ann  the desperate  attempts of saving ann and the harmfulness the people do to the natural enviromenta great picturesque  film with  gorgeous cinematography and good acting
May 8 2011,positive,real quality remake of an old school classic
May 8 2011,negative,alright for jack black
May 7 2011,positive,it has some rewatchability mostly because of adrien brodys performance which it could have easily not it did spend some time exploring the human relationships of the characters and of the title character instead of only providing eye candy for this reason it becomes a repeat popcorn flick one can pop watch when the mood strikes right

Apr 11 2011,positive,a rare remake that realy works
Apr 11 2011,positive,i was slightly reluctant to watch this because i remember i disliked this flim when i watched this in 2007 i honestly dont know what was wrong with me this film is amazing the only reason i watched it is because it was made by peter jackson who is one of my favirit directors along side chrisopher nolan the film reminds me alot of the other peter jackson films ive seen the lord o th rings trilogy because it has brilliant music is very long and the sorta main bit is like towrds the end honestly this filmis on of my favorite films ever it keeps so much tension even though i knew what will happen and at the end i almost sd a tear in my eye the acting is superb with any huge stars also the story is brilliant and again i have to say the music is superb i connot get it out of my head    to see more of my reviews got to thatonewebsitetumblrcom

Apr 11 2011,positive,original was far better
Apr 10 2011,positive,a truly amazung film dealing with the monstrosity that is mankind
Apr 10 2011,positive,cant disagree that the special effects in the movie are stunnig but i beleive that peter jacksonas he usually does really dragged this movie on that soon made me lose interest in the movie sure in some cases that was a good thing like the spider pit the dinsosaur fights and king kongs last stand on the empire state building althought did we really need anna and king kong ice skating or the 90 minutes before they got on skull island no we did not
Apr 10 2011,positive,it may be a little cheesy at times but peter jackson left me satisfied and im very glad he made it making this movie was a dream of his and it shows
Apr 10 2011,positive,amazing movie for the genres sci fi historic fantasy and adventure sucessfull in all four special effects and settings are also spectacular its a must see
Apr 10 2011,positive,great romance great movie thrilling
Apr 9 2011,positive,enjoy this movie also on my 6 week list
Apr 9 2011,positive,even with good special effects king kong had some of the worst acting ever jack black was okay in the film but not good enough
Apr 9 2011,neutral,too long but it was nice
Apr 9 2011,negative,this movie is extremely overrated i think most people said this movie was good just because of its special effects the acting is ok some actors did decent while others were horrible the editing is horrible like the scene when the boat crashes one second people are running around and then you see them on the lifeboat i thought it would be important to see what they did to get off the boat and into the lifeboat but no also some other scenes last forever for no reason the effects are good but you can tell its cg and in some close ups you can tell its green screen another thing what was with that ice scene where the girl and kong just slide around together i have lots of complaints for this movie like how its to long kong shouldve been in the city longer and the movie can be horribly over dramatic but besides its flaws its a fun little ride its got lots of flaws but if you can ignore them this is a decent little flick
Apr 9 2011,positive,very thrilling and action packed movie
Apr 9 2011,positive,hmm watch it i guess its pretty good
Apr 9 2011,positive,good plot well shot shows what men will do for money
Apr 9 2011,positive,not as good as the original but defiantly a great film
Apr 9 2011,negative,an abomination to the 1933 masterpiece
Apr 8 2011,positive,this movie was a true masterpiece with everything the soundtrack the visual effects from the actors to the plot witch make it a true treasure film to the ones that grew up with the classic king kong 1993 generally this movie is probably in the top list of the most successful remakes ever made
Apr 7 2011,positive,jak black is always funny the movie is a classic i liked it
Apr 7 2011,positive,he aint got sht on me
Apr 7 2011,positive,the only part of this film worth watching is the first half kong rampaging through new york is surprisingly dull made all the more unwatchable by the fact that by the time this happens fatigue has already set in
Apr 7 2011,positive,the original one of course
Apr 6 2011,positive,gets kudos for sticking to the source plus i like adrian brody
Apr 6 2011,positive,thot it ws very good the length of the movie didnt bother me at all

Apr 6 2011,positive,i thought it was very good it was awesome wing king and trex were fighting
Apr 5 2011,positive,a great epic filled with allot of goodies only issues is jack black he shouldnt be in the film missed cast
Apr 5 2011,positive,a movie that reaches for epic measures but falters due to poor pacing and a weak emotional connection to the characters  however it has spectacular visuals
Apr 5 2011,negative,it was fun to watch but why was jack black cast in this film
Apr 4 2011,positive,its new a way of showing how humans are in reality
Apr 3 2011,negative,nothing like the original
Apr 3 2011,positive,the original is much better
Apr 2 2011,positive,though the writing isnt perfect the visuals are peter jackson did an amazing job with this and andy serkis continues to amaze me with his extremely underrated cgi performances my only knock on this would be that slow motion sequences are used way too often
Apr 1 2011,neutral,cut the painfully long beginning and the overdone number of creatures and you have a terrific movie fit snugly into 2 hours
Apr 1 2011,positive,good special effects depends on the version you watch
Apr 1 2011,positive,an intense movie but no where near as good as the original
Mar 31 2011,positive,this film does very well on its kong and female lead performances however i think thats all the film had going for it special effects were very well done
Mar 31 2011,neutral,i cant see it before
Mar 30 2011,positive,actually liked the 1 w jack black 1st on was alright
Mar 30 2011,positive,i watched it i found where to watch it for free with wiibeezcom

Mar 27 2011,negative,oh lordy it went on forever
Mar 26 2011,negative,special effects good
Mar 25 2011,positive,like lord of the rings you really have to dedicate time to sit down and watch king kong like the main character is absolutely huge with complicated subplots and lovingly detailed cgi  its really easy to get confused and subsequently lost but stillgood movie but it doesnt slow down for you
Mar 25 2011,positive,very detailed  graphical in script and in visual
Mar 24 2011,positive,i loved it it was sad though 
Mar 24 2011,positive,one of the greatest adaptations of the classics against the possible odds of faillure great actors naomy watts and adrien brody
Mar 24 2011,positive,having a giant ape roam around new york and the island  killing dinosaurs escaping and destroying every thing was intense  sure the movie may be over the limit  time wise but the special effects are amazing and the location and the scenery of the movie was so awesome
Mar 23 2011,neutral,king of kong has some fantastic visuals but over all it is hallow and a disservice to the original the film ponders way to much in the begging and in my mind it never requires from that sure king kong looks great and there are some really enjoyable moments i still thought by the end of it it was an enjoyable experience from start to finish
Mar 22 2011,positive,good remake of an old movie kind of long but was worth it
Mar 20 2011,positive,quick ratings used to set this test for recommendations  selected movies then rate movies
Mar 19 2011,positive,good moviegood director

Mar 19 2011,positive,o   it blew my mindd
Mar 18 2011,positive,also great and makes me sad
Mar 18 2011,positive,good but very long
Mar 18 2011,positive,yeah it has flaws but rarely does a film achieve as high a level of beauty as peter jacksons king kong
Mar 17 2011,positive,an enormous labor of love terrific entertainment with tremendous largescale effects big excitement and above all heart pj sure loves kong
Mar 17 2011,positive,awsome i loved the cool fight scences a great remake does justice to the orignial
Mar 17 2011,positive,amazing very good movie
Mar 17 2011,positive,a reviewing might be necessary but i remember this being a very good remake not only are the special effects great but the period art direction and the heart of the story stood out for me as reasons why this is more than your typical hollywood blockbuster very good and entertaining despite its length that said its certainly far too long and overblown ill rewatch it sometime and see where i stand then    45
Mar 17 2011,negative,not enough human interest i find the same with all of peter jacksons films they lack that magic
Mar 17 2011,negative,one of the worst remakes ever  jack black come on
Mar 16 2011,positive,really wasnt too fussed
Mar 16 2011,positive,creepy crawlies were a bit gross but loved this one
Mar 15 2011,positive,though filled with bad dialogue and jack blacks laughable acting peter jacksons king kong has great emotional depth and a stunning view
Mar 15 2011,negative,only good scene was the giant bugs
Mar 14 2011,positive,good but wont buy
Mar 14 2011,positive,lots of action great for everybody
Mar 14 2011,positive,totally underrated  yeah its very long and bloated and has peter jacksons stamp of excess all over itbut what a ride  plus in todays watchathome environment i found it very enjoyable to watch it in three sections  up through the first scary scene on skull island with the natives then through the end of skull island when they trap kong and return to land and finally the rest of the movie back in the city  they did a remarkable job giving kong real emotion and expressiveness  some say jack black was miscast  i utterly disagree  had he done the usual physical jack black shtick yes it would have been poor casting  but i thought he was pretty understated and pulled of the slimy selfinterested with a streak of admirable ambition type pretty darn well
Mar 14 2011,positive,one of the greatest remakes of all time turning a classic monster movie into an epic romantic film that even guys love to watch kong is the archetypal man dominating larger than life in control of the world around him his contrasts to ann and the unexplainable chemistry is underscored by visual presentations yet for her kong sacrifices everything he knew and travels toward his ultimate demise although  ann led to his death in the end she had given him something to have lived for and to kong it was all that mattered with this small twist and typical peter jackson cinematography to go along king kong triumphantly lives up to the legacy of its original
Mar 14 2011,negative,its ok jus shows tht even the hardest of males are vulnerable to the pleasant feeling o love
Mar 13 2011,negative,good effects but shit
Mar 12 2011,positive,starts a little slow but kong is amazing any time he is on screen
Mar 11 2011,positive,vastly underrated beautifully directed by peter jackson action  packed and surprisingly touching
Mar 10 2011,neutral,the original king kong its one of the best movies in hitory telling us about an era where people where so amazed but the movie but peter jacksons king kong not bad but no even close to meet the expectation we had very very long very weird choice on the cast i dont kwow about jack black for this one naomy watts as ann darrow on the other hand was the best form the movie but sometimes classics are better to stay classics
Mar 10 2011,negative,technically brilliant but grossly meandering  the cg work is near flawless but the story is overlong inconsistent and laden with pointless action sequences  a lot of scenes  such as the valley of ever larger bugs who apparently live only eat humans  do not make sense or advance the plot  no human could survive the manhandling that ann endures and despite all the screen time devoted to her relationship with kong the affection she develops never makes sense
Mar 10 2011,positive,peter jacksont passion project and it shows the monster with a heart the original 1933 film is great but i look at it more as a historical piece that reflects the treatment of black people and women at the time but this film was able to step past all of that and take the simple story of the ape and the woman and turn it into a fine film
Mar 10 2011,positive,i wouldnt go out of my way to watch this again    while very entertaining with some really awesome scenes this movie is extremely absurd and i dont mean the idea of a giant ape i mean some of the ridiculous situations they are in and the extreme suspension of disbelief required to get through some of the scenes     the movie does a great job of making you feel for kong most of the action sequences were really exciting and this movie surprisingly did not bore me its over 3 hours long but even the slow parts entertained me lots of great scenes and memorable moments and jack black was bearable for the most part a lot of good characters but some really useless ones as well    the cgi is dated and there are some extremely questionable directing decisions like this hilariously bad idea he tries multiple times using low frame rate shots during suspenseful moments kept making me laugh every time he used it lots of cliches and cheesy moments about 3 viewings      spoilers      cheesiest line ever is the final line of the movie it wasnt the airplanes it was beauty killed the beast rofl
Mar 10 2011,positive,not as good as jeff bridges but i really liked this version
Mar 10 2011,positive,brilliant fx pjs direction is swift and potent and the presence of the quite lovely naomi watts makes this film quite appealing
Mar 10 2011,negative,not peter jacksons greaest works 3 hours are a long running time for a kind of monster films
Mar 10 2011,positive,classic brought up to date
Mar 9 2011,positive,peter jackson a fantastic visionary and the one who brought you the box office smash hit the lord of the rings trilogy now we all know king kong from the classic 1900s film now weve all know that remakes arent the greatest but this movie is one of the best it is truly spectacular and visually stunning ranging from the island itself as for the dinosaurs and kong itself as they movie through this cg i landscape with life and realism now the cast is a great chose as jack black pulls on a very great performance as well as andy serkis doing the motion capture for kong this movie has been a all time favorite as it will go down as a classic like the original
Mar 9 2011,positive,this movie is okgreat graphics
Mar 9 2011,negative,this movie is extremely overrated i think most people said this movie was good just because of its special effects the acting is ok some actors did decent while others were horrible the editing is horrible like the scene when the boat crashes one second people are running around and then you see them on the lifeboat i thought it would be important to see what they did to get off the boat and into the lifeboat but no also some other scenes last forever for no reason the effects are good but you can tell its cg and in some close ups you can tell its green screen another thing what was with that ice scene where the girl and kong just slide around together i have lots of complaints for this movie like how its to long kong shouldve been in the city longer and the movie can be horribly over dramatic but besides its flaws its a fun little ride its got lots of flaws but if you can ignore them this is a decent little flick
Mar 9 2011,positive,still is a graet program
Mar 9 2011,positive,how many remakes of a giant ape can you do
Mar 7 2011,positive,one of the better remakes
Mar 7 2011,positive,i love this movie too
Mar 7 2011,negative,oh god that is all
Mar 7 2011,positive,as much as i love this god damn movie and it likely has my favorite action scenes ever there are quite a few cartoonish amateurish mistakes scattered about this disarmingly long remake
Mar 7 2011,positive,this movie is fabulous and awesome
Mar 7 2011,neutral,interesting take on the classic kong story  its king kong in jurassic park thanks to pjacksons directing
Mar 6 2011,negative,way to long and jack black was a poor pick
Mar 6 2011,positive,great action sequences and great visual effects the only cgi i thought could be improved was with the raptors they were nothing compared to the ones from the jurassic park series the movie also features kyle chandler who i think is a very underrated actor all in all a solid remake with some great action sequences it was a bit too long though especially in the beginning
Mar 6 2011,positive,i love this movie lyla does too shes sad at the ending though
Mar 6 2011,positive,if you can mind its length then youre set loved every second of it peter jackson presents another masterpiece
Mar 6 2011,negative,the half star is for the budget
Mar 5 2011,neutral,gave me a chuckle    the scenes between kong and the lead actress reminded me of star wars proportioned romance scenes particularly when all of the chaos in new york stops so kong can do this half dance on the ice lake     jack arrives at the end with a sort of  so what did i miss look to him    and the topper was jack black looking stoned at the end    this cgi remake somehow made the 1930s versions graphics seem cutting edge     i enjoyed it for the pure lulz factor but it was pretty terrible overall
Mar 5 2011,negative,jack black ruined this movie for me
Mar 5 2011,negative,king kong was all right but the movie is a stinker  watch the earlier versions
Mar 5 2011,positive,the special effects and cinematography were visually stunning  we have an a list cast of actors but there were a few shortcomings  jackson has a knack for making movies too long and he didnt disappoint here then theres a the question of what the point of the movie was other than a remake with a lot of sequences similar to the original maybe its a homage to that film but the epic scope and nature of the film did help carry it all to the way through
Mar 5 2011,negative,watching this now its bad
Mar 5 2011,positive,it was like a comedy to me especially with black jack the wardrobe design was great and the story board was with the most entertaining out comes
Mar 4 2011,positive,i liked it wouldnt buy it though
Mar 4 2011,negative,i just really dont like this film at all
Mar 4 2011,positive,this is a good movie
Mar 4 2011,positive,love the entry of king kong
Mar 3 2011,positive,its purely popcorn fare very exciting lavish well produced
Mar 3 2011,positive,it may not surpass the 1933 classic and yes it is too long bat least peter jackson the genius who brought jrr tolkeins glorious vision of middle earth to life through the lord of the rings trilogy remembers what made the original kong a hollywood classic and takes notes on how to make this king kong remake the perfect addition to the fey wrey classic
Mar 3 2011,positive,one of the only good remakes    its just way too long but other than that its good
Mar 2 2011,positive,this was great but could have been even better with yesterdays and todays technology

Feb 13 2011,positive,peter jacksons king kong is an incredible remake  ann dorrow naomi watts is a beautiful woman who wants to be an actress  carl denhem is a movie director looking for the next big thing and she is the right person for it  he puts her a crew and a male star named jack driscoll on a boat heading for an island but a storm sends them to a mysterious place known as skull island  there many derranged natives capture these men and prepare to feed ann to there beast  the beast turns out to be a giant ape and takes her to deep in the jungle and falls in love with the woman and fights for her and in return she grows to car for the beast  the crew and espically jack want to save and must pay many deaths to get to her  but when they get to her in time will they be able to get her away from the mother of all monsters  the movie was underrated by viewers they didnt understand what an incredible epic this was and had a short attention span  the effects are tremendous the story is prestigous and the acting even if not oscar worthy is great  peter jackson has a way of making a old tale incredible again  this movie amazing and one of the greatest remakes i can think of
Feb 13 2011,positive,really good but long
Feb 13 2011,positive,it is cool how he fight the airplanes
Feb 13 2011,positive,peter jackson does a fine job at portraying the myth of king kong the movie has some dark vibe all over it that i really enjoyed it the mysterious never leaves the scene although i think andy serkis who plays king kong job is highly underrated he passes emotion to the screen by helping in making king kong more tangible to everyone including his fellow colleagues the expressions in king kongs face truly amazed me naomi watts character in some parts did annoy me but she compensated it in the last part of the film    its a long movie but the end is so worth it brought me to tears
Feb 13 2011,positive,decent but way too long

Feb 12 2011,positive,remove the dinasaur stampede scene and the insect pit scene which are both badly handled and childish and this film becomes a classic  the empire state building scenes are amazing and magical   sometimes directors need to be better editors and not think everything they shot should be in the fim
Feb 11 2011,negative,cgi looks fantastic but eventually it falls flat

Feb 4 2011,negative,jack black is the worst actor  memo to jb  we like you when you are quirky and goofy  go back to your niche
Feb 4 2011,positive,yes its a damn long movie but thats no reason to hold a grudge against it anyone who likes the old one more than this one is clearly a nostalgia drunk airhead in my opinion this take holds much more emotion than the 1930s take could have kongs eyes at the end during his demise and the fact you know it is soon to come make it an emotional tear when he his finally shot down from the empire state building in addition to that the chases are much more exciting than the claymation and there are moments of incredible creepiness all of the characters play their characters wonderfully except jack black who once again comes off as just jack black but thats not necessarily a bad thing overall its well worth the time put into it for watching
Feb 3 2011,positive,not as good as the the original with the stopmotion kong and not one of peter jacksons best i felt it went on too long

Jan 22 2011,positive,carl denham ladies and gentlemen i give you kong the eighth wonder of the world     king kong is just about as epic as movies can come peter jackson did an amazing job with this remake the movie is extremely long and for a lot of people that is a problem not for me i love long movies if they are good that is and this one is great i love everything about even the first hour which a lot of people complain about also some things are worth being patient for and the last two hours of this movie are definitely among them once kong hits the screen its two hours of nonstop action and brilliant effects endless creature battles with one of the most epic battles ever kong vs trex kong looks absolutely amazing every detail of him is flawless the cast is very good too i really enjoyed jack black and adrien brody in this movie and i always love naomi watts the movie looks spectacular and ultimately is a really cool fun and entertaining ride well worth the three hour running time
Jan 22 2011,positive,peter jackcons epic passion projects greatest weakness is its greatest strength love you feel every inch is held with tlc but its unnecesarry character overdevelopment effects the running time and takes too long to get to the adventure

Jan 18 2011,positive,just watched this again recently and it really such a great remake if you can get ppast jack black being jack black for the entire movie then the other performances are great the every alluring adrien brody brings his charcter to life as the writer action is not something lacking with danger around every turn prehistoric monsters cannibals and of course the giant gorilla but utimately we see that it is human beings who are the real monsters and you end up feeling sorry for kong and for the future of humanity
Jan 18 2011,positive,beautiful nothing more
Jan 17 2011,positive,hailed as one of the most famous hollywood romances of the 20th century king kong is brought back to life by visionary director peter jackson who casts his cinematic majesty and brilliance into the legendary journey to skull island whilst criticized for its whopping length spanning just over three hours the best possible tribute to the revolutionary 1933 culturally historically and aesthetically significant epic in my opinion deserved nothing less it feels not a moment is wasted    the film begins in a perverse and povertystricken new york during the great depression once her theatre becomes broke and closes down ann darrow naomi watts a fragile vaudeville actress looses her job initially refusing work in a burlesque house ann is once again the victim of an unremorseful and harsh world she is no stranger to     by sheer chance she meets the deceiving and stubborn documentary film maker carl denham jack black who pays for an apple she is forced to steal from a street vendor carl is desperate to hire a new leading lady for his upcoming romanticadventure film before his studio and police find him and tries to persuade ann to join his cast bound for singapore on the ss venture but it is when she discovers her favourite playwright jack driscoll adrien brody is the films screenwriter that she agrees to come     this synopsis is quite lengthy so if you know the rest then skip down to the last paragraph    as the ss venture sails to singapore despite their distance and nerves partly owing to ann embarrassingly mistaking another crew member for him jack driscoll falls for ann he hints this to her when he dedicates a comedy script to her but ann dismisses the hint possibly because not only is she a stranger to love but out of her dominating and ugly society isnt used to the idea in general a factor of which defines her relationship with kong    after a warrant arrives on the ship for denhams arrest roughened skipper captain englehorn thomas kretschmann becomes fed up with carls deceit and selfish desires that put the entire voyage into threat carl also reveals the true destination for his film the mythical skull island and further angers the ships crew englehorn and several of his shipmates including war veteran ben hayes evan parke lumpy andy serkis the ships cook surgeon and barber and wild and abandoned stowaway jimmy jamie bell attempt to turn the ship around but it crashes against rocks in the thick fog encircling the island     denham and his wary cast and crew including ann and jack leave the ship whilst it is unfit to leave and wedged against a rock to explore the island upon arriving they wander into quite a developed native settlement believed to be abandoned until the see a lone hungry child but as they discover not for chocolate    after being attacked by a very alive cannibalistic settlement narrowly being rescued by englehorn and his machine guns denhams party retreats back to the ship just before they are able to sail back into open water a band of cannibals capture ann on the ship in order to offer her as a sacrifice to a terrifying beast king of the island kong     jack refuses to leave without ann and immediately sets off to rescue her despite the ships opportunity to leave he is accompanied by carl and his film assistants who want to help save ann but also slow the party to shoot the numerous dinosaurs and monstrous invertebrate on the island necessary to save his career and bail out of a likely jail term     at once ann is terrified of the monstrous gorilla holding her captive but misses being tossed into a pit by kong with skeletons bearing the same ceremonious necklace after a few simultaneous encounters with trexes rescued by kong each time ann realizes the epitaph of kong to be presently excluding jack a monstrous thing but the sole being she could depend on    and so after approximately a 400 word synopsis the adventure begins fresh from the ground breaking success of the lord of the rings jackson refreshes every element in elegant filmmaking rendering a suspenseful tender emotionally enthralling story of trust love and betrayal and perfectly rejuvenates the classic with revolutionary set designs and ambitious gripping action sequences and special effects naomi watts is a beautiful sad and harshly done by ann darrow giving the plots love them a fantastic fragility which is strengthened by adrien brodys quietly passionate and heroic jack driscoll who is just a writer without any muscles jack black adds his usual humorous neurosis and andy serkis portrayal of kong similar to the way gollum was done in tlotr is to definately be commended upon oh and james newton howard has possibly produced his best soundtrack in this filmjust magical    overall king kong is highly recommended for a mix of gripping adventure and gentle resonant romance
Jan 17 2011,negative,well made  sadly not my cup of tea
Jan 17 2011,positive,loved every one and of course the fx get better
Jan 17 2011,positive,too much cgi it was everywhere and also i could not take jack black seriously

Jan 14 2011,positive,peter jacksons big budget remake of the 1933 classic is a visual feast for the eyes and sencesbutat times thats what it mostly strides to bei did enjoy this updatingbut there are times when a film wants to be an epic too badlythere is alot of character development heresome times too muchour first glimpse of kong is almost a good hour and twenty minutes ini remember seeing the film in the theatreand some people started to get antsyat one point someone actually shouted out show me the monkeyyesat three hourswith a three hour and twenty minute dirctors cutking kong is a long journeyaside from thatjackson does his usual brilliant directing joba real craftsman who knows how to put every dollar on the screenwith a wonderful sweeping score by james newton howardkong is definately one adventure worth undertaking
Jan 13 2011,positive,a remake that is actually good holy crap d
Jan 13 2011,negative,my biggest complaint was how long it took them to get to the island but i havent seen it since it came out in theaters maybe all that time spent off the island had a deeper meaning i would have to watch it again to know
Jan 13 2011,positive,hands down some of the best special effects ever but way to long the first 50 mins are very dis possible all it is used for is for jackson to let the hype build to finally reveal the beast
Jan 13 2011,positive,really good story fx were excellent you felt what you were supposed to when you werethe central park scene was my favorite too much action with the three vascosauri and you could have cut five minutes out of the scenr with the worms and bugs
Jan 13 2011,positive,watts is no jessica lange brody is no bridges and black is no grothan apart from the long boring and aimless intro thats my biggest complaint dont get me wrong im a fan of all those actors however they just dont cut it for this flick jessica lange was so cute and innocent and super sexy watts is obviously beautiful and intelligent but she doesnt have the sex appeal that is necessary in this story and to add insult to injury somehow the writer had her as a vaudeville character even going so far as to reject a burlesque job bridges in the 70s version was always the smart one figuring things out before anyone else what does brodys character do to prove himself in the beginning he gets fooled by jack black into going on the voyagewow impressive right off the bat hes a sucker visually yes awesomesome really cool scenery but if they put half as much time into the writing character development as they do the cgi we can have really great movies jackson is always serving up cheesemakes me wonder if he respects his audience or just thinks their all 11 year olds or what

Jan 10 2011,positive,really cool remake by peter jackson however it was a bit long but it was pretty cool i do prefer the original simply because its a classic shorter and straight to the point adventure

Dec 24 2010,positive,films owned on dvd    i can see why some dont like king kong there could have been better pacing at parts and the cgi is obvious at times but peter jackson has really put together a solid adventure epic here at least give him credit for the special effects though it is clear to see its obviously cgi at times the fight scenes and chase scenes are breathtaking and very highly entertaining to watch plus i really appreciated how the film featured a solid storyline and the film overall didnt allow the effects to steal the show casting was also great too as naomi watts adrien brody and even jack black all give strong performances definitely one of the best films of 2005

Dec 23 2010,positive,a great remake of a classic
Dec 23 2010,positive,i love it i love the first 75 minutes of the movie where kong is not there i found them both funny and interesting as they depicted the era they lived in and gave us a sample of each of the characters personalities and then kong shows up beautiful i loved this remake of one of my favorite monster movies of all time

Dec 12 2010,positive,this film is able to use computer animation to depict incredible action and pathos from its hero king kong performances from the actors are also worth noting however the film is too longwinded and could have benefited from more conciseness

Dec 9 2010,positive,an emotional thrilling and gorgeous tale of love films like the rings trilogy this and district 9 let me forgive and forget cinema blunders such as the lovely bones kong is in many ways better than the orignal not many will like me saying that but visiually and emotionally it is i cared way more about the chars in this one than the last one and yes i am surprised i like a remake over the beloved classic on which it is based but its true jackson is way awesome and if i had to name a flaw it would have to be its length but why should i i didnt want it to end another surprising thing is the performaces i expected niamoi watts to do well and adrien brody but black jack black i never expected him and watts to steal the show black did a great job on his char and he seemed to me to be quite funny well yes kong is an extraordinary remake that excelled the orginal giving it a most deserved 1010

Dec 9 2010,neutral,ehh once u see it u wont want to again
Dec 9 2010,positive,a bombastic blockbuster with perfect visuals and a starstudded cast it may be but with every minute that passes on the way to that 3 hour finish time king kongs glossy appeal slips away    who better to remake the 1933 classic king kong than the man who brought such unforgettable life to the lord of the rings trilogy peter jackson is undoubtedly a brilliant choice to oversee this project his love of grandeur and keen eye for beauty amidst surrounding chaos give king kong a sumptuous look quite frankly i would go as far as saying the glossy visuals are faultless and that it ranks as one of the most attractive films of the year furthermore jacksons talent for creating great spectacle along with an unparalleled respect for the material also work towards making this the perfect blockbuster however where jackson fails is in the editing room at more than three hours the film is not only far too long but after the first hour ends and we havent seen anything from kong himself it also feels very overplayed and rather indulgent    the first hour is spent scenesetting and giving the characters surprisingly detailed back stories granted the postponing of kongs introduction clearly allows for sufficient build up of suspense and i didnt find myself resenting this first portion of the movie the fine cast are not hard to watch naomi watts in particular shows yet again that shes a great actress especially considering that her damselindistress character has the potential to be incredibly annoying something she never once becomes    however i am forced to question the casting of jack black as wily filmmaker carl denham his routine is to a lesser degree the same as every other role hes played his penchant for silly smirks and jim carreylike gurning become very wearing and in the end andy serkis giant gorilla demonstrates more emotional depth than black ever does    so after more than an hour of lightlyamusing storytelling and little sense of danger the film shifts gear dramatically and becomes a mass of nonstop craziness from dinosaurs to downright frightening aboriginals it literally never ends of course we also get to meet the monkey and despite waiting its no anticlimax andy serkis gives kong a brilliantly human quality which thanks to the cuttingedge cgi makes him the most emotionallyfascinating character in the entire film this is a great success for jackson who has unfortunately failed to balance the opulence with the muchneeded subtleties as he did so well with lord of the rings    the main problem with this middle section which lasts some ninety minutes is that the plot entirely disappears the story which was so thoroughly set up in the first hour is now rendered almost irrelevant by the dinosaur chases and chest beating monkey antics as such the fact weve now been watching for around two and half hours and still not seen kong come anywhere near new york let alone half way up the empire state building is a major cause frustration i feel this proves that jackson and his team should have bitten the bullet and been more ruthless in the editing room the awe he creates through the action which is great by the way is lost when watching it turns from enjoyment to endurance    thus by the final half hour i was feeling rather spent the obligatory empire state scene is typically impressive but i was getting dangerously close to not even caring and feeling very restless in my seat as such what could have been another jewel in jacksons blockbuster crown suffers immensely from his unwillingness to cut away the chaff and streamline this mammoth movie into something far more enjoyable
Dec 7 2010,positive,the closest you can come to the 33 film even if it goes a little over the top  its an excellent piece of filmmaking both exciting and poignant
Dec 7 2010,negative,when i first watched it it sacerd me but now its cool

Dec 1 2010,positive,with a movie scale as big as king kong himself this whopper of a movie delivers three hours of amazing visuals sprawling from 1930s new york to the mysterious skull island its a beautiful movie king kong is stunning from top to bottom the set designs will immerse you into the world of kong plus the cast performances are enough to engage you and keep you mesmerised most noticeably naomi watts who is golden in any role the story is so absorbing and engaging you actually find yourself wanting more than three hours this remake is a classic peter jackson knows how to keep the suspense flowing and the drama so powerful and the ending is sad even though we all know the outcome of this big character
Nov 30 2010,negative,nice graphic animation
Nov 30 2010,positive,animals that act like humans okay sure but 3 hours

Nov 28 2010,positive,i like this a lot its more like godzilla type of movie
Nov 28 2010,positive,dr no boots the bond franchise quite well arguably the best evildoer in the series joseph wiseman plays the timeless role of the title villian sean connery portrays bond in a respectable flemingesque way in his first of six appearances in the film franchise the rest of the cast is par at best and the score is much less than stellar but overall dr no is a great start to my favorite film series
Nov 28 2010,positive,the king kong films have a long and storied history in hollywood from merian coopers and ernest shoedshacks original 1933 classic and the unfortunate 1976 jeff bridges and jessica lange remake to the various incarnations of mighty joe young kong and his brethren have been in the public consciousness throughout the development of cinema somehow as technology and special effects have improved over the years it seems that someone is always keen to showcase the industrys latest developments by making a more realistic giant ape enter director peter jackson fresh from his massive success with the lord of the rings films he chose king kong to be a showcase release for his weta digital effects house what followed was a film that while impressive at times didnt quite live up to the hype and promise that mr jacksons previous films had built with audiences    vaudevillian actress ann darrow naomi watts is struggling to find work in the wake of the great depression a chance meeting with a downandout film director by the name of carl denham jack black lands her a role in his next film carl has conned his way into arranging for a cast and crew chartered a ship and has informed his production team that they are steaming to singapore for a location shoot little do they know that carl has set his sites on the mysterious skull island a foreboding place where natives and strange creatures lurk screenwriter jack driscoll adrien brody takes a liking to darrow and by the time the ship arrives at skull island romance is blooming between the two unfortunately for them as well as the rest of the crew their fortunes take a turn for the worst as the entire group is savagely attacked by natives and scattered across the island darrow is offered to kong a massive apelike creature who immediately becomes smitten with the blonde actress as a human sacrifice as the rest of the crew make their way back to the ship and attempt to rescue darrow a variety of strange creatures will test their survival instincts can they rescue darrow and get back to the safety of their ship or does denham have other plans for the giant ape    king kong has become something of a polarizing film for many movie fans hardly any two fans agree on the movie and it has generated a wide variety of opinions and emotions ive seen the film on half a dozen occasions cine its release and still cant quite make out what the point of the remake is sure there are some great effects the acting is solid and there are a lot of amazing scenes in the film but it has never gelled into a coherent experience king kong is for all intents and purposes a series of finely crafted action scenes a few nice dramatic moments and a whole lot of boring filler thrown in perhaps mr jackson was getting in a bit over his head by turning what was in its original incarnation in 1933 a 104 minute film into a story that goes on for well over three hours this is one long movie of course thats not to say that the basic beauty and the beast story of king kong has been lost in this version its just that it has been almost completely buried by all the meaninglessness and lengthy setup that causes the audience to just above give up on the film before kong ever seen appears on screen    whats good about king kong the action scenes are wonderfully choreographed and feature some remarkable cgi effects kongs seemingly endless fight with a pack of trexes is often breathlessly thrilling to experience andy serkis gollum from the lord of the rings films also does a fantastic job of breathing life into kong and giving his cgirendered performance a truly human depth as i stated earlier all of the acting is top notch as well does it all add up to a coherent film i dont believe it does but im sure others feel differently king kong certainly has a builtin audience    king kong is a frustrating movie there is so much that i like about the movie yet the films extended running time as well as its numerous boring and lengthy passages make the film hard to digest
Nov 28 2010,positive,sentimental and you dont realize the time fly by its good movie fare
Nov 28 2010,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it has a great story line that will grab your heart and the graphics make it seem so real i cried for two days straight after seeing this movie
Nov 26 2010,positive,its the story of a girl whom alongside a crew andin film director jack balck is persuaded to join the shipa and go to film upon this deseted island an adventure film which has battles that will make you keep watching and asking for more and the storyline attached to it makes it worthwile watchign too it has great great spcial effects within it  king kong against two dinasaurs and nicole kidman  beautiful women contrasted with king kong which lets face it sometimes we can relate too him makes us relate to the characters both emotionally if you like adventure and action looking films its a film worthwile to watch can become long sometimes the start bit and lets face it  camera shots arent the greatest apart when you dip into watching the battles but as soon as you watch the battles with the dinasaur it makes it grea to see thats the only thing that i can fault in it but the stoyrline is contentable and aestetically pleasing which makes it worthwile seeing
Nov 25 2010,positive,the fight wth the dinousars wth serious
Nov 25 2010,positive,yeah cool movie
Nov 25 2010,positive,one of my fave movies
Nov 24 2010,positive,peter jacksons vision of the giant ape is nothing short of spectacular and that saves it from a poor performance by naomi watts in the lead role

Nov 24 2010,positive,entertaining a bit of every thing
Nov 23 2010,positive,good irregular story
Nov 23 2010,positive,one of the best remakes ever i loved the acting especially adrien brodys and jack blacks and the special affects were so life like i almost died it is a bit long and it takes a while for the action to start but that was important for the plot it was an emotional film and peter jackson really stayed ture to the movie unlike that disaster remake from the 80s one of my favorite all time films
Nov 23 2010,positive,really slow on the beginning then it opens up

Nov 20 2010,positive,i couldnt sleep thinking about the bugs
Nov 20 2010,positive,the effects in the whole film are spectacular to look at but the only thing that i didnt like was all of the freaking dialogue literally the dialogue in this film just made an already really long film feel even longer but still the action and effects are great things to look at my favorite scene in the whole film is the mutant bug pit scene just because of how bizarre and weird these creatures looked there is one other thing i didnt like about this film that was kongs face i dont know why but this kongs face just seemed well to human and i know they modeled kongs face after a real life human being andy serkis but every expression on kongs face is easy to tell what hes thinking it just doesnt seem animal like think about it every time you look at a photo of an animal or see it at the zoo or in the wild you cant tell what theyre thinking but im not saying it was bad im just nitpicking
Nov 20 2010,negative,enough with the remakes already
Nov 19 2010,positive,its a much better film then people truely gave credit for special effects are amazing the story is solid and its suspenseful yet at the same time it falls apart in a couple of catagories still awesome though

Nov 10 2010,positive,i saw this movie with a group of friends back in 2005 and we loved it im a fan of naomi watts and adrien brody so that just made the film even better only problem i had with it was that it seemed to be rushed even though the movie was long they could have done a two part to it and that would have elaborated the story out better it would be epic and worth 5 stars
Nov 10 2010,positive,loved the original the ones made after that have fallen short for me
Nov 10 2010,neutral,too long and not enough charm
Nov 9 2010,positive,fairly long and drags in a lot of parts but overall quite good jack black is really good and brody plays a perfect common hero role

Nov 6 2010,positive,made scream at the first made me cried in the end
Nov 6 2010,positive,its not only action its drama romance and a bit of comedy chucked in

Nov 1 2010,neutral,the first one is better
Nov 1 2010,negative,mr jackson i think youre cool  but just because lord of the rings worked well at 3 hours doesnt mean every other film is  there are some good things about it  the visual effects are nice the scenery is beautiful and naomi watts is excellent  butjack black  really  and the film seems to be one long extended action sequence that one its over i felt more relieved than sad to see it end  well at least jackson went back to shortening his movies with the lovely bones

Oct 31 2010,positive,i like the original king kong but naomi watts plays purdy good as faye rays damsel in distress

Oct 29 2010,neutral,i prefer the 1933 version
Oct 29 2010,positive,epic cinematic experience in the year it was released 2005 by peter jackson even if it is running for 3 hours i did not feel it was that long because it was a fun experience to watch it naomi watts jack black and andrien brody was stunning however i did not feel that the ending lived up to the peoples expectation the contrary between the skull island and new york really makes this movie interesting brilliant visual effects that turns new york into a place that feels oldie
Oct 28 2010,positive,peter jackson has done an awesome job yet again
Oct 27 2010,negative,story about king kong who fall in love with a beautiful girl     strange
Oct 27 2010,positive,a great homage to the original
Oct 27 2010,positive,cool movie good graphicts
Oct 25 2010,positive,i know plenty of people who hate this film a lot friends that might punch me in the face for giving this more than one star so why did i give it 4 because i thought it was a fun homage to the original king kong seriously if youre a fan of the 1933 version give this one at least one viewing even if you dont like the overall package all the little references and homages to the original are fun to watch for the special effects are a highlight here kong is incredibly expressive and ironically enough the most human or enjoyable character on screen the rest of the actors do pretty good jobs naomi does just fine building an almost genuine bond with kong but why is jack black in this why but the biggest complaint people have with this one is the length of 3 hours and 8 minutes this is the most credible flaw in the whole film it is too long considering the material but i still recommend this one its a fun time long but fun and you could do much much worse transformers 2 is 2 and a half hours long and it still felt longer than this did when it comes to blockbuster action films
Oct 25 2010,positive,iv seen the movie not a bad movie to watch
Oct 25 2010,positive,i loved this movie but some parts freaked me but others had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happed next

Oct 24 2010,positive,a visually spectacular movie peter jackson did not disappoint with special effects and bringing back the awesomeness the very first king kong in the 30s brought to cinema however the dinosaurs were disappointinly mutant and messed up and the natives were excessively scary people
Oct 24 2010,positive,i love king kong the gorillas are sooo very cute
Oct 24 2010,negative,not my kind of movie
Oct 24 2010,positive,i would have given it four stars but jack black took it
Oct 23 2010,positive,yay peter jackson i liked jack black in this no one else did though
Oct 23 2010,positive,king kong is not an original movie storywise  the acting is hit and miss and it is just too long  but what went right  everything else  the pure delight of this film is its fantastic visuals great special effects and absolutely fantastic attention to detail in the last hour  it is a great entertainment if you skip the entire first hour that is    the story is the same as the original a film cast and crew travel to an island to shoot a dream project of a partially crazy director and he endangers everyone by nearly sacraficing all of their lives just for his movie  the highlight of what they bump into on this prehistoric island is a giant gorilla that would make godzilla crap himself  the ending is so infamous that its not worth repeating just for the sake of this review  good stuff    as i have said the only reason that this is a great remake is the visual department  just the same as the original the special effects are groundbreaking and are repeated way too often to be good anymore  weather its stopmotion or cgi as long as kong isnt in a rubber suit youre in for a fun time
Oct 23 2010,positive,i liked this movie  i saw the original king kong black and white movie and this was a great remake of it  this one added some new scenes which was great  sad at the end i hate sad endings but i enjoyed the movie
Oct 22 2010,positive,king kong truely breathtaking peter took the classic movie and gave a gaint heart as well as the incredible fight scenes that really show off what it was like 100 million years ago

Oct 21 2010,positive,one of my faviourite movie
Oct 21 2010,positive,unfortunately i dont have the time spare to give king kong the thrilling review it deserves so ill keep it short and sweet i love everything about this movie heart beating tearing jerking action i love how kong is portrayed and i found the acting to be great especially naomi watts performance it has the visual to back it up too looking stunning in hd i couldnt recommend king kong more and its going down on my mental list of favourites

Oct 8 2010,positive,a lot of people love this movie and so do i and i want to see this movie
Oct 8 2010,positive,scifi is always good
Oct 7 2010,positive,there are many versions of king kong and i think this one is by far the best of the bunch it takes the story of the gigantic king kong and takes us more into his world    there are so many special effects in this movie and more crazy creatures than you can point a stick at i also thought that jack black was pretty decent in this movie  when i heard he was in it i actually thought it was going to suck but it is a very good movie    it followed some of the original story but with all of the things they added to it they made it more believeable like how do you capture a creature that can defeat a trex in a fight there were a few things that were a bit far fetched and impossible but you have to remember that none of this really exists and just enjoy the movie    i really liked king kong
Oct 7 2010,positive,the movie are in the box with many other movies i like it ok but not more
Oct 7 2010,positive,always cries at the end when king kong dies
Oct 7 2010,positive,poor kongfelt sorry for the animalwhy cant people just stay away from them
Oct 7 2010,positive,the first half of the movie is best when they are stuck in the island but the rest of the movie sucks  four stars for the first half
Oct 7 2010,negative,good special effect but its duration just too long and become pointless naomi watts again make me enjoy watching this long duration movie
Oct 7 2010,positive,i read a pretty negative review here on rtcom when this movie first came out it essentially said it sucked because everything was the same as the 1933 version and his exact quote was the gorilla still dies in the end well duh i think everyone knew that the point is to pay homage to the 1933 version and recreate the magic and allure in todays modern age kong in 05 did exactly what the original did it told a wonderful story of how humans exploit every opportunity how were a selfish and inhumane species and its also about love and at the end heartbreak    no theres nothing new here but kong did what it was supposed to do and that was break new ground in special effects and tell the same heartwrenching story as the original its a typical peter jackson three hour epic but its definitely worth a scope
Oct 7 2010,neutral,great on the big skeen
Oct 6 2010,negative,what happened to peter jackson
Oct 6 2010,positive,never thought i could shed a tear for an ape

Oct 5 2010,positive,love cgi   naomi watts   jack black op
Oct 4 2010,positive,i really love this movie its one of my all time favorites everything is fitting in this movie the story is well known but still very good and well brought to the audience the setting and atmosphere and the surroundings are so realistic and well done new york looks awesome especially at night in this movie the island looks dangerous but on the other hand really beautiful the characters are fitting in their role and the cast is just awesome alone adrian brody and jack black the special effects are brilliant kong looks so realistic and the fight against the trex is a effect bomb the action is good too best scenes are the trex fight and the flight from the dinosaures the only thing thats a bit bad is that the movie is a little bit too long and that the viewer dont get what the real relationship between ape and woman is all in  all one of the best movies ever and i can recommend this to everyone
Oct 4 2010,positive,some may find a perfect score for a remake a bit much but i can seriously find no problems with this movie as of now i havent seen the original king kong and seeing it might change my opinion of this one but for now this is an incredibly beloved movie to me and one of my favourites of all time king kong is probably one of the best remakes ever made with its splendid scenery and fantastic performances it is also directed by peter jackson the director of lord of the rings so naturally the film is lush and visually spectacular while also being emotionally resonant    for those of you who dont know the story of king kong it takes place in the 1930s and it is about ann darrow naomi watts a poor woman who is asked by carl denham jack black a film director to join his next picture which involves a long journey by boat to the mysterious skull island she falls in love with jack driscoll the screenwriter adrien brody and they finally make it to skull island about 50 minutes into the movie after encountering some hostile natives they go back on the boat but ann is kidnapped and sacrificed to kong     it is revealed by all the skulls that king kong has killed many sacrifices in the past but ann survives because she uses her vaudeville skills to impress kong during all that jack leads an expedition to rescue ann and they capture kong and take him back to new york its here where we see the true nature of carl denham which is a greedy bastard rather than a blithering idiot sociopath kong gets angry takes darrow to the top of the empire state building he gets shot down and the ending iconic line from denham is still there     from what i know about the original the basic plot elements are still there and some are even elaborated there are a lot more characters and the crew is very interesting the script is fairly wellwritten and the characterization was amazing i loved all the characters in this movie from ann darrow to jack driscoll to every single member of the crew id have to say my favourite character was jack but the other two were the badass ship captain and jamie bells kleptomaniac shipmate jimmy the brilliant characterization is better than the script itself and it is accompanied by some spectacular performances    naomi watts adrien brody and jack black play the main characters of this film well the main human characters there is a giant cgi monkey and they deliver fine performances jack black tries his hardest to separate from his comedy schtick but he doesnt always succeed despite his performance being decent naomi and adrien have reasonable chemistry as a couple and they turn in fine performances as well adrien being the best of the bunch those of you who have read my celebrity crushes list know that he is one of them but this isnt just a good movie because of him the supporting cast was fantastic as well so fine performances all around    this is also a peter jackson film so you can expect the film to be richly immersive and laden with quality special effects that it is and the film won a welldeserved academy award for the special effects they used motion capture for kong himself the model being andy serkis i suppose i could say that andy and naomi had good chemistry as well and he gave a good emotionally resonant performance as kong the art direction at the beginning and the end was fantastic and could have even been nominated because the sets looked very realistic of the depression at the time     skull island itself is also beautiful everything from the scenery to the creatures there are action scenes like when the dinos get the shit kicked out of them by kong and there are a lot of cool creatures like a worm that eats a certain crew member and bugs that crawl all over adrien and that have to be shot off by jamie bell that was an incredibly cool scene and these were incredibly cool special effects however despite the awesome effects the film is also very emotionally resonant doing the herculean task of making us feel something for a cgi ape    all in all king kong could be considered a modern classic to some me being one of them if anyone were to make an event film for our time it would be the director of lord of the rings all three lotrs being event films unto themselves this film is one of my favourite films of all time and comes with one of my strongest recommendations ever anyway i would not consider it essential viewing but for those who are curious i would encourage you to check it out trust me you wont be disappointed

Sep 28 2010,negative,i recommend watching this if you need to fall asleep never finished it
Sep 28 2010,positive,a good film remake that alot of people should enjoy its a long movie and really you could break it down into 3 parts the first part when their in new york and decide to go to the island and the boat ride there the second part being their adventures on the island and the last part being when they return to new york i feel like the movie handles its length well though and you wont be looking at the clock going is this over yet something i find surprising was that when i first watched this i thought the special effects were amazing but after rewatching it a few years later i wasnt as impressed and thought   well thats in front of a green screen performances are good here naomi watts is good considering theres a large part of the film where she doesnt talk and is playing with a cgi gorilla i think this version of king kong was well done and that alot of people would also enjoy it

Sep 9 2010,negative,not a patch on the original and jack black was awful
Sep 9 2010,positive,sit back and dont relax because this is an intense and a hell of a joyride i usually have many doubts about a 3rd or 4th recreation of a classic but in this case peter jackson took that idea and made a hard hitting monster flick the special effects were incredible
Sep 8 2010,positive,an excitingly unforgettable monster movie  never mind the jeff bridges version  this one stays true to the original made way back when  peter jackson has done it again
Sep 8 2010,positive,i was never a fan of the original kong but peter jackson has managed to take that concept add what certainly resembles a love story between woman and ape in the original fay wray was not drawn to kong only he to her and made it seem not ridiculous but instead deeply moving
Sep 8 2010,positive,this movie really frightened me by the scene of the angry king kong
Sep 8 2010,positive,improves on the original in almost every way except for the definitely toolong run time in all other respects though this film stands out as a shining example of how to successfully remake a classic

Sep 1 2010,positive,amazing spectacular spellbinding jackson gets it right when i first saw this in theaters it didnt seem like three hours no one around me had a dry eye at the end the 33 and 76 versions didnt give you the attachment to kong the way this version did this movie couldnt have been any better two thumbs way up
Aug 31 2010,positive,a great success of peter jacksons career being his first film after lord of the rings this was the film he always wished to make a remake of his favorite film and its truly an amazing work of visuals and entertainment overusing the effects in some unnecessarily long scenes but its a great work of cinema
Aug 31 2010,positive,yeah this was the movie that i had seen on big screen it was better than what i had expected love the twists the set was a time machine
Aug 31 2010,positive,alright movie just way to long

Aug 28 2010,positive,the best remake of king kong
Aug 27 2010,positive,great movie but the story line was way too stretched out
Aug 27 2010,neutral,king kong has impressive cgi effects but that dehumanizes the characters damaging the plot
Aug 27 2010,positive,equally as good as the original version if not only a little worse either way it does the original justice it takes the storyline and the messages of the original film and elaborates on them a whole lot more making it very lengthy in the original everything was very vague and brief rendering it into a relatively short 100 minute film this new version is over three hours long the characters seem to understand the monster equally as much as the audience does especially the female lead that he falls in love with in the original all shes there to do is scream in the newer version she actually has a relatively believable connection with the monster i also have to give credit to this film for not relying heavily on advanced digital effects like the remakes of charlie and the chocolate factory or clash of the titans granted the advanced effects are still there and theyre still mindblowingly realistic but instead of just showing off those effects they use it to tell the story with plenty of emotion and elegance on the whole king kong is a wellconstructed wellcast and incredibly emotional remake leaving quite a mark on our new generation of cinema
Aug 27 2010,positive,i hav only one word to describe this filmepic
Aug 26 2010,positive,take off an hour and you have yourself a terrific epic this as is not so much
Aug 26 2010,positive,good but also too long
Aug 26 2010,positive,i was entertained enough to finish
Aug 26 2010,positive,its hard to know where to start with this brilliant film that takes you through three journeys getting to skull island meeting kong and kongs broadway debut its a whopping 3 hours long but every minute is worth watching naomi watts is a nice surprise as leading lady ann darrow and jack black is also perfect as the greedy carl denham visually its stunning and kong just looks fantastic overall a brilliant blockbuster movie thats easily the best of its kind i just loved it
Aug 26 2010,positive,good movie great graphics but its a love story  kinda like titanic
Aug 26 2010,positive,it was pretty good for a really long remake
Aug 25 2010,positive,it almosts like the original 1932 version but better it has heart supercharged excitement  enough visual effects to make it extremely watchable
Aug 25 2010,positive,awesome movie adrien brody is a great actor
Aug 25 2010,positive,great special effects just an hour too long
Aug 25 2010,positive,bw gorrilla looks a bit plastic but i like the lady
Aug 24 2010,positive,didnt like it that much
Aug 24 2010,positive,an effectsdriven film that manages to keep the story going it will appeal to monsterdisastermovie fans not a bad remake compared to godzilla and it also has some emotional weight to add to the spectacle
Aug 24 2010,positive,no remake of the original king kong could be better than this one this movie was a good that a lot of people considered it to be better than the original one as for me i cant really decide theyre both just so good peter jackson did a great job of making his remake be as close to the original movie as possible even including the lost spider pit sequence that was excluded from the original king kong that was definitely an awesome idea he also made other scenes that werent shown in theaters but on the special dvd those were his own versions of scenes from the original movie i also love that three rexes fought kong instead of just one like the first movie that was the most awesome part of the movie for me the storyline involving the relationship between ann and kong is very similar to the first movie except that in this version ann isnt afraid of kong anymore at one point in the movie and she befriends him because of this it made the ending when kong was killed even more depressing than the way it ended int he first king kong movie even so this move is a fantastic movie to watch and will always be remembered as one of the best movie remakes if not the best
Aug 24 2010,positive,a masterpiece excellent effects and cast truly beautiful
Aug 24 2010,positive,great movie seen it 3 times and it still makes me laugh
Aug 23 2010,negative,the one peter jackson shouldnt put on his resume

Aug 20 2010,negative,all i can say is it was better than the first one lol thats it
Aug 18 2010,negative,thought it was interesting but never grasped the concept
Aug 18 2010,positive,i dont understand why so many people disliked this movie  i thought it was great  an amazing adventure movie filled with good action on a huge scale  some parts showing the relationship between kong and naomi watts character was a bit too much but never took me away from the movie
Aug 18 2010,positive,love this movie but sad ending
Aug 18 2010,negative,expected more from mr jackson loved dead alive bad taste the frighteners abd al the early wingnut stuff
Aug 18 2010,negative,this is a cool film in wondering place
Aug 17 2010,positive,moving amazing fx spectacle by jackson
Aug 17 2010,negative,its an oddity jack black is miscast i liked the first 45 minutes then it gets a bit pretentious cos we have to be told that the quest for the gorilla is like heart of darkness then we have to forget about all that because jackson wants to give us an hours cgifest for the hell of it  billy elliot who has never handled a weapon turns out to be the worlds only marksman with a tommy gun even if you wouldnt look at him twice in this movie he is pretty superb in nymphomaniac vol ii  then the gorilla is looking at the sunset down in the dumps after having had both arms bitten by tyrannosaurus rexes and a midget is trying to cheer him up by juggling id have knocked her over the fucking clifftop    so then we get back to new york and the temperature is 10 below freezing and naomi watts is more skimpily clad than marilyn monroe in florida but it doesnt matter because naomi is more in love with the gorilla than he is with her thats good because otherwise the breeze up the empire state building is going to play havoc with her nips mind he kills or maims half a dozen platinum blondes looking for her which kind of dilutes the beauty tamed the beast message but the real message is that jackson wants some platinum blonde to love him big ugly gorilla that he is maybe you should eat fewer pies peter actually its crisps hes addicted to if the hobbit extras are anything to go by
Aug 16 2010,negative,i dont get what all the fuss is about the first king kong became a classic in large part due to its breakthrough fx the only think this remake had to offer was good looking effects and art direction with no real addition to the plot or depht the question i keep asking is if the original king kong was never released and then jackson made this movie would the critics love it so much i think itd be a good event movie but not much more than that and besides i cant take jack black  or adrien brody  seriously here
Aug 15 2010,positive,yes likve iti hope i can see the reall king kong
Aug 15 2010,positive,a really good movie from start to finish it starts with carl denham wants to make a good movie on a mysterious island but ann get captured by king kong so jack driscoll and the crew goes out looking for ann with many journies ahead

Aug 3 2010,negative,its about a big monkey can get off
Aug 3 2010,positive,wow you never realize just how phenomenal of an actor mr thomas jacob black truly is until you see him truly nailing the dual roles oh wait hes just carl denham and king kong is being played by a real king the mocap king mr andy serkis yeah i know that joke stank but at least its better than trying to figure out how to make seven sentences out of king kong holding ann darrow and whispering my precious come on its another peter jackson epic featuring a motioncaptured performance of an obsessed animalistic creature by andy serkis the only thing more sensible than a scene like that is well jack black being casted in a pete jackson drama yeah i know that sounds weird but heavenly creatures was such an obnoxious joke of a film that it was only a matter of time before peter jackson actually brought jack black into one of his films and lo and behold jack the guitar ripper is here at last and just in time for pete jacksons latest installment of the leadershippositiontitled epics trilogy first it was the lord of the rings and now its the king of kongs and boy is it ever being the king of this entire franchise its the greatest the grandest and most certainly the biggest of all the installments but the problem is that mr jackson isnt about to let you forget the biggest part because if you thought that the last two incarnations were looselyedited enough then brother just you wait    the film opens up with a good closeto 3 minute long montage of depression era new york and we dont even get the common courtesy of credits so that it would make sense for the montage to be so overlong and just like that you get some idea of how loose this film is going to be until you find out that you hadnt seen anything yet hey in all fairness if this peter jacksondirected king kong epic were to run under 170 minutes it would be an offense but jackson still taints his vision by padding it out so much with repetition and superfluous sequences particularly when it comes to action dont get me wrong im ape about the fabulous action sequences but theyre still so packed in to the point of often being and to make matters worse theyre overlong and if you think im exaggerating when i tell you that these action sequences are ridiculously long allow me to tell you that in the extended version theres under if not just barely two minutes of nonactionoriented added material as well as  only two new action sequences yet somewhere along the way the film became almost twenty minutes longer and those action sequences were relatively average if not short in length of course its not just the style that gets overexposed because even more than that theres too much substance in that there are so many moments of exposition and excessive padding with repetition and cuttable scenes and if you think im exaggerating on that its exactly a whopping  no joke  bu50 minutes in before they reach the islandbu the length of the film is so forced yet almost worst of all its disjointed featuring many moments that just plain dont gel well with the progression of the story leaving countless shifts in event or tone after two and a half hours  or three hours in the case of the extended version  of excessive exposition and broad atmosphere the entire final act of the film is one big closetototallysilent meditation to feel so startlingly offputting its unreal now for those thinking that the king kong classic has a story structure thats impossible to as faithful to as possible and also turn into a largescale mammothlength epic like the lord of the rings pete jackson has added so much depth and material  while still retaining so much faith in the classic  as well as omitted so much material that would have fit like a glove and were he to trim a lot up add more material and sew everything together more comfortably like he famously did with effortless nearmasterful skill with lotr we would still have the big 3 hour epic that this really should be only then make no bones about it this would have been phenomenal however as it stands well throw me on the cross and accuse me of not being a real critic or too much of a contemporary but this film is immensely superior to the classic yet on its own its still a pretty darn good film regardless of its spots of squandered potential because what jackson does right he does fabulously notably when it comes to technical value    it only comes in at the bookends of the film but whenever we get a glimpse at good ol 1930s new york it takes your breath away as the production designs are so sweeping and incredibly detailed reviving that era not just in appearance but in essence and its all complimented by stunning cinematography the scope of the photography is so broad and the lighting is so lush and vivid pulling you into this world and haunting you with pure spectacle which isnt to say that thats the only piece of spectacle that captures your attention because this film is well worth seeing for its visual effects alone because i must say that mr pete jackson has done it again and broken ground the visual effects are absolutely stellar in their seamless highly authentic incorporation into this world that is really brought to life by all of this digital dazzle especially when it comes to the action sequences which are as i said excessive and sometimes overbearing in length yet its not like they run out of steam after a while in fact a big reason why you kind of forget that theres supposed a story in the midst of that of all of this action is not just because the action goes on for too long because the action leaves you incapable of thinking about anything else except awesome as every stellar piece of technical value marries with jacksons masterful understanding of dynamic sweeping choreography and staging to produce constant unrelentingly hardcore action that delivers on the sweep tension and thrills of a big blockbuster with authenticity and grace the most notable effect is easily the king kong one and not just because that big cg gorilla is our titular character but because its an effect that not only supplements the dazzling action but the substance and for that it should come as no surprise that major props need to go to the man behind the motion capture the great andy serkis who gives a predictably remarkable performance as this visual effect giving the facial animators more than enough material to work with by giving a subtle graceful and charm interpretive performance riddled with haunting expressiveness that makes the king kong effect not only authentic as an animal but as an actual living thing that loves fears and struggles to what he feels in right weve seen puppets and people in suits yet its the version of kong that was created by a bunch of computer nerds coloring over an actual person that is easily the most intimate depth in its presence on screen and for that let us not only praise the effects team and mr serkis but the great pete jackson himself who has taken what was always meant to be a horror movie icon and turned it into something completely different because where the 1976 interpretation of kong did its job of using the beast to supplement a message jacksons interpretation of the beast is no supplement to some kind of message its simply a living breathing creature with emotion and depth that doesnt fall victim to a rejecting destructive society yet simply to circumstance and as you watch this humanoid live fight and face pain for the object of his affection you cant help but feel as though this icon that has existed for decades is truly complete pete jacksons bringing this creature to life is a satisfying provocative experience that he ameliorates with tender meditative emotional resonance that i must admit gets as sappy as a lot of aspects that boast cheesiness that ive been a little too underemphatic about yet that sentimentality wins you over in the end and leaves you emotionally riveted to the point of being chocked or even teared up it doesnt deliver all the time but when this film does deliver it kills it not just as an emotional experience but as charmer as well being made so charming by its colorful of charismas from jack black  who charms and impresses as this more overly ambitious unconventional visionary thats on his way to comeuppance version of carl denham that he seems surprisingly very well cast for  to our other major leads the lovely naomi watts and the big nosedi mean dashing adrien brody both of whom are like black playing very altred versions of classic characters and also like black they sell it retaining the essence and chemistry of the original ann darrow and jack driscoll while giving them more humanity and heroism that makes them very positive characters as well as engaging leads from the cast to the technical team the film has the makings of a truly powerful film and while its looseness and cheesiness keep it from being that youll ultimately walk away entertained touched and ultimately more satisfied than not    overall cheesiness and melodrama damage the potential masterpiece while extreme looseness and inconsistencies knock it on its back making it too disjointed and messy to be the riveting epic that it would have been were its fitting mammoth scope more comfortably handled yet in the end the back pulls itself on its feet more often than not delivering on a dazzling visual style and fantastic visual effects to supplement both hardcore action as well as the tender emotion that peter jackson incorporates with depth and genuinely effective emotional resonance and his performers  particularly the charming jack black heroic adrien brody compelling naomi watts and of course the haunting andy serkis  give that emotional resonance an extra kick of charm ultimately leaving peter jacksons epic vision of king kong to stand as a thoroughly entertaining and deeply touching incarnation that well surpassed every preceding installment including the very classic that started it all if you dont mind me saying    35  good
Aug 2 2010,positive,wow loved it although the action scenes were a little too long

Aug 1 2010,neutral,spectacular to look at far too longwinded
Jul 31 2010,positive,a dream project for peter jackson ever since he was a kid  the 1933s king kong is actually the reason why peter jackson is a filmmaker a fun fact for anyone who doesnt know yet  after making the lord of the rings now hes in the position where he can do anything he wants  first up king kong    the plot is pretty much the same as the 1933s version save for a few differences  for instance ann darrow played by the wonderful naomi watts is a vaudeville performer and jack driscoll played by adrien brody is a screenwriter    overall it is a good movie  its exciting and riveting  the effects for the gorilla himself are very good  a wonderful performance by andy serkis    if i have to complain about anything it would be the length the poor visual effects for dinosaurs and the moments where it felt like too much  it seems as if jackson couldnt get out of his 3hour shell  but he says that hes proud of his film so i cant change his mind  however if you have the time see this film
Jul 31 2010,positive,good in some parts weird in some parts
Jul 31 2010,positive,graphic and story are perfect

Jul 30 2010,positive,good but not a patch on the original
Jul 29 2010,negative,i dont know why peter jackson decided to do this this film is for lack of a better word crap maybe he thought that after his huge success with the lord of the rings it would turn out the same way with king kongi dont know  maybe im just mean because i always hated the plot

Jul 28 2010,positive,its straight off a perfect movie in every genre its got the funny frightening breathtaking emotional and beautiful just like how anne says it after those three hours peter jacksons version of one of my favorite classics is one of the best remakes made today and shows his grand talent of moviemaking great performances by the whole crew naomi watts was fantastic was anne jack black impressed me as carl denham being the funny guy all the time i thought this showed me how much of a great actor he is and adrien brody is always a great actor ha ha but what kept it from being as good as the original was of course a few changes but what surprised me was many of the qualities of the 1933 film was included including the time period which was relief and many changes i did enjoy including the trexs being realistic as in jurassic park and the huge love story between anne and kong that i was deeply touched by err got be a man but even by itself its still incredible and epic till today every minute of it i loved and it is as good as the original thank you peter jackson thank you     and who doesnt enjoy seeing that big monkey beat the hell out of the dinos
Jul 28 2010,negative,almost fell asleep during this one  original was better
Jul 28 2010,positive,a very solid reinvisioning of king kong with equally solid acting and cinematography it did go longer than it probably should have but it has a good payout at the end
Jul 27 2010,positive,not too long at all  i even love the deliberately paced intro  im a big believer in the fact that threehour films are a greater opportunity to more fully immerse oneself into the nuances of the world  whats most impressive is how engaging the love story wasthats good directing

Jul 26 2010,positive,i like this movie movies humanism bold interesting logic
Jul 25 2010,negative,a lengthy remake of a classic film i felt that kong was too humanistic with way too many emotions it was a different approach of kong compared to a destructive monster i prefer the classic and felt this remake was almost pointless with all the action scenes and lengthy orchestrated shots if it werent so long id recommend it id still choose the timeless classic over it thoughthis movie at the same time is funny in how it tries to make kong feel sentimental
Jul 25 2010,positive,primate lovin is alright
Jul 25 2010,positive,alot better than the original film thought wasnt bad for its time at all some impressive scenes on skull island and action is provided although the film is slightly long winded and before the skull island scene only a few moments are important or worth watching
Jul 25 2010,positive,full of action comedy and thrills this sets the record of 3 hour and 8 minutes for me the longest movie that i have ever watched before carl denham wants to film a movie on an undiscovered island which is skull island he gets an actress a playwright and all the crew guys this film deserves an oscar for best film
Jul 25 2010,positive,its not my kinda movie but its good
Jul 25 2010,positive,king kong in this remake version maybe not the best just like original version but i like the way that this movie should be exactly the cg is the best answer

Jul 20 2010,positive,not nearly as good as the original but still very well made and at times spectacular the main weakness of the film is the running time there is no way that a story as simple as king kong needs three hours to be told the first hour is grating and ends up feeling completely pointless however once we are past the first hour the film begins getting much better
Jul 20 2010,neutral,wasnt as good as it couldve been but ok
Jul 20 2010,positive,hardcore movie buffs will enjoy the film for what its worth while others may be shunned off by its ridiculous unnecessary length

Jul 19 2010,negative,over rated trite crap
Jul 19 2010,positive,this remarkable remake of a timeless classic king kong 1933 truly have been upgraded on many levels with  peter jackson one of the most notable and acclaimed filmmaker from new zealand his special effect department have successfully not just revived the whole story but fucked our brains to death as well fueled by cgi laden hightech spfx which inevitably created mindnumbness just like most of jacksons films as lotr trilogy as the prime exampleking kong has become a great epic made by 21t centurys generation of amazing filmmakers     at the core unlike transformersbut wait remember michael bay is no jackson who certainly has a higher capacity compare to that airhead loserking kong is not just merely cgi driven high budget picture which relies on nothing but groundbreaking visual show off but it also was a spectacular achievement especially in terms of resurrecting an old masterpiece body and soul jackson and his teams effort attempting an awakening must have deserved an applaud  firstly king kong original version became a phenomenon of its own at that time and even it has been for decades it must need more than a confidence and indulgence to repull the material out of the closeddrawer and create a renewed refreshed and somewhat different story then hoping to be able creating a new phenomenon secondly they actually nailed it they completely succeed to rewrite a script based on old source although it has been changed almost on major parts except for the historical iconic moment where king kong crawled and climbed up the empire state building at the endthen made an amazing film out of it carries on his distinctive trademark  over used green screen and prolongoverly longlong lasting you just name it action sequences which honestly turned out okay although on some level it seems too much and too long and resulted in exhaustion that had been shown since his early career frightenerslotr trilogyetc peter jackson repeated highly successful formula combining many elements in his film as much as what he had done to lotr  imaginative adventure grandeur battle scene sentimental romance plus bundance of extremely weirddisgusting and scary monsters presences that surely have led to a first class experience for million viewers on theatre    overall 2005s king kong even tough wasnt as powerfull as its predecessor in 1933 1976s remake doesnt count was a superb and marvelous motion picture enriched with supremely wellacted performances especially by naomi watts and jack black masterfullycreated pre historic predators plus thrilling and frightening action moments king kong is an another astonishing long exhausted in good way and dangerous journey into the unknown world lies beneath the earth    directing       a  acting          b  script          b  spfx            a  editing         b  cinematography  a  overall         a

Jul 18 2010,negative,saw it it was pretty good
Jul 17 2010,positive,personally a movie with adrien brody and jack black costarring as leads sounds dumb to me but they compliment each other well and serve a great purpose in making this film good the only part the irks me about this movie is the dinosaur fight scene i mean it becomes like one of those cheap asian godzilla verse movies with that scene naomi watts and colin hanks also have good roles in the movie my personal favorite scene is when kong does his normal capture the girl climb the building scene i sympathize with kong for he was stripped from his land to be some freak act at some rich snobs new york act all and all 810 for good acting average plot and great acting

Jul 6 2010,positive,unnecessarily long but a pleasure to watch king kongs negatives are outweighed by its positives the film pays a respectful yet quite contemporarily filmed homage to the original while it dips more than a few times over its running time king kong is full of worthy performances for the year

Jul 4 2010,positive,i like this movie more than i thought i would i do like jack black a lot he is one of my favorite funny guys pretty good movie actually
Jul 4 2010,positive,i salute peter jackson for having the gutts to remake such a classical tale and he did it well    i love how he give attention to details especially in character development but i cant help to say the first 1 hour of the show seems draggy and somewhat boring despite knowing how essential it was to develop the characters    the cg  graphics was a perfect blend with the sets it doesnt look fake at all especially the lead king kong himself as much as how realistic the cgs are some shots are quite ridiculous for instances how anne was being swing and pulled around i believe she would have been torn to pieces if its in real life    the additional dino vs king kong part is too much to swallow i felt it has very much wasted valueable time and does not really tells much i seriously think the movie would be much shorter if those unnecessary scenes were edited in a better way    one thing i couldnt understand is i cant accept how peter jackson chooses to waste time on the additional dino vs king kong part rather than show how the king kong was brought to the main city     it could have been better if peter jackson could cut it short and focus more on the main items instead of creating more subplots that confuses the audiences even more
Jul 3 2010,neutral,jack black didnt really fit into this movie
Jul 3 2010,positive,i wonder if the beast can see beauty too and be sp persistence to guard it with all they haveeven life

Jun 22 2010,positive,show presenting old stereotypes of the worlds not known to europeans but entertaining
Jun 22 2010,positive,jacksons direction and the performances ultimately saves this remake of the 1933 classic but do to its excessive length it loses momentum as it goes on seriously i dont need to see kong slide around a frozen central park for half an hour

Jun 20 2010,positive,new names new characters new island and a new story make a whole new kong jack black brings an unexpected burst of humor among a brilliant acting cast in this well done remake of the 1933 classic       a washed up directorjack black decides to take one more shot at making a movie with a broke unknown starletnaomi watts chartering a boat with out revealing the true destination he plots the course to skull island and the mythical kong great fight scenes and brutal natives make this movie every bit as entertaining as the original
Jun 20 2010,positive,the whole family loves it
Jun 19 2010,neutral,blah boring not concrete plot my son loves it though
Jun 19 2010,positive,its length may leave some viewers bored and waiting for something to happen but once things do finally kick in the film becomes thoroughly engrossing in both its visual achievements and its emotional connections between woman and beast
Jun 19 2010,negative,i dont like this one so much
Jun 18 2010,positive,one of the best films of 2005 has fantastic visuals and great depiction of the eight wonder of the world
Jun 17 2010,positive,this is an amazing movie that would not stop throwing the punches just when i thought a bit of suspense was over it started up with something new and fresh meaning something that blew my mind or something i had not seen before it does start off a bit slow but that hour we get to spend watching the characters interact with one another in somewhat normal situations then they land on the island and bam the action adventure starts and does not let up  i loved the original king kong of course but this one had more of an emotional punch naomi watts did an amazing job at making her interaction with the ape extremely believable in fact every time she and the ape are together i forget i am watching a movie and that is what a movie should do i thought that all of the actors were well casted even jack black the effects were amazing and still look amazing after being released almost five years ago peter jackson is an amazing director who knows how to make bigbudget movies that have heart and convey a story fantastically to the big screen
Jun 17 2010,positive,while this film was too long it grasped great special effects great acting by jack black in a serious role and once again peter jackson making an extraordinary film i purchased the 3 disk box set and thought how amazing it was how much time they put into this movie even going to visit places where wild apes habitated to understand better their movements and such

Jun 16 2010,negative,what a loadbut it does have watts and bell and will watch them in anything  should have just called it jurassic park 4 and been done with it  even better would have been if they cut out all but naomi and jamie and called it the ann darrow and jimmy show  as i said i could watch them in anything
Jun 16 2010,positive,its definitely worth a couple of watches but this one is nothing compared to the masterpiece of the black and white older version    82 out of 10
Jun 16 2010,neutral,of all the remakes this is by far the most humane and respectable  real suspense good acting good direction and very touching  appropriate sympathy for the kong
Jun 16 2010,positive,lets show sm gorilla loveloved it
Jun 15 2010,positive,the beginning had the most remark from my friends you didnt even get to see the ape till like an hour into the movie regardless the plot was good the theme was beautiful and the graphics were amazing i did recommend this movie to many of my friends
Jun 15 2010,positive,not a bad movie but most of the first hour was really hard to get into
Jun 15 2010,positive,king kong stays pretty true to the original naomi watts plays fay wrays ann darrow perfectly right down to her emotional connection with kong which is helped by the fact that kong is pretty darn lovable when he is not ripping apart dinosaurs i can not express how much more i enjoyed this movie without the guy in the suit special effects kong was very appealing visually as well as the other dinosaurs
Jun 15 2010,negative,not as gud as could hav been
Jun 15 2010,positive,not bad but not great either jack black is annoying but adrian big nose is great the fights are awesome altogether a pretty decent film

Jun 11 2010,positive,well its an epic theres no doubt about that and peter jackson again brings forth stunning special effects and great actors with good roles is there anything that lets this movie down not really but its not one of you top 5 movies of all time for sure worth a watch and worth a solid rating

Jun 8 2010,positive,quite weird but cool
Jun 7 2010,positive,another awsome movie
Jun 7 2010,negative,this film is the definition of bloated overproduction
Jun 7 2010,positive,going to see this movie i was suprised by its brillience   it differs in alot of ways from the original but in changing it it brings out a whole new perception of kong no longer is he the towering giant that horrifies all that look upon it he is a caring and loving ape the relationship with kong and anne now does not feel uncomfortable and the special effects and cinematography really make the film feel alive and real   just sit back and relax in the epic and moving tale
Jun 7 2010,positive,king kong was way better then the other monstersbut this just is a little over rated
Jun 6 2010,positive,i like jack black more as a funny man but the king kong vs dinosaur thing was kind of cool

Jun 3 2010,neutral,its okay but scary for ages 47
Jun 3 2010,positive,i got very emotional watching this film because it does tug you heart strings and its a classic tale of beauty and the beast
Jun 3 2010,positive,we dont see much remakes that are as memorable as the original film they are based off of these days this isnt one of those films the kong franchise has had remakes which havent gone well with critics but that was until this movie granted the original is still the better movie but this is one that is the best out of any of the remakes of it    its the same general story a crazy director jack black along with his crew head to a mysterious island where his lead actress naomi watts gets kidnapped and well you get the idea    overall the first thing that makes this film a success is its director peter jackson i mean this was the guy that directed lord of the rings he does good in this one too like the original the cast is great in this movie led in this one by watts i wouldnt say that black and adrien brody who plays this versions jack driscoll are as great as bruce cabot or robert armstrong but they were okay    i think the main problem with this film is the runtime this beats freakin avatar in run time and if you look at the special edition which adds more run time it even beats titanic damn thats a long movie and yes this is one of those movies where the run time does get to you at times this is mainly because jackson adds more to the story we see why denham decides to go to skull island we see that ann darrow is a struggling vaudeville actress and this film has a role change in that jack driscoll is denhams screenwriter rather than being the first mate of the ship also the movie spends too much time on the boat for some reason if you look at jacksons three lord of the rings films and this film thats over 12 hours worth of film or in short half a day i get how this film is supposed to be different than the original but couldnt it have been shortened i mean there are some unneeded scenes in this film that probably shouldve been taken out    but to be honest thats my only criticism for this movie its a great remake of a classic 1933 film that 1933 film is the superior one when you compare the two but this is a solid remake no doubt about it
Jun 3 2010,positive,welldone movie better to watch in the big screen
Jun 3 2010,positive,wow a film i never get bored watching
Jun 3 2010,positive,the first king kong was more outragous but the nature in this one was excellent i didnt like the performance of jane misses passion was a kind of fake
Jun 3 2010,positive,haha i was such a loser i got really scared and had to hold on to my cousins arm at one point
Jun 2 2010,negative,i like the ride in disney world
Jun 2 2010,positive,yeah now it was nice but its a little too long
Jun 1 2010,positive,king kong has the breathtaking scenery we have come to expect from peter jacksons films  as well as career best performance from jack black
May 31 2010,positive,i wonder how many times they will make this movie fantastic special effects and jack black is surprisingly good in his sinister role  a bit long though
May 31 2010,positive,one of the best super effect movie loved it  yet 3 hr is a long time to watch a movie
May 31 2010,positive,it was a great movie it was very sad though
May 30 2010,positive,forget the 2ndthis one rocks
May 30 2010,positive,nowhere near the achievement of the 1933 epic this film attempts to emulate still this movie manages to impress with grand scale visuals and several fleeting moments of genuine human emotion ape emotion as well casting was a true failure jack black though talented and not half bad in the role was a huge misstep his intensity is well performed but he fails to delve into the drama and break free from his silly comedic style which he truly reigns at adrien brody as well though a grandly talented actor and a personal favourite did not fill the heros boot he was cast to fill his quiet awkward nature and lack of charisma left no emotional investment in his character andy serkis however delivers this under appreciated star again showcases the fruit of his painstaking research and deep commitment to his role and indeed portrays kong extremely well especially considering he had no lines as the character however having him play the cook as well shows he too can play a role he is not suited for   in closing this film though temporarily entertaining is far too long and with many holes in plot characters and emotion impresses but leaves a forgettable legacy
May 30 2010,positive,hate king kong in this movie
May 29 2010,negative,this was a silly movie but enjoyable nonetheless
May 29 2010,positive,all the movies are wonderful

May 27 2010,neutral,ummmmm alwys this movies is a classic
May 26 2010,positive, king kong the eighth wonder of the world        an epic remake of the classic heartwarming love story by 3 time academy award winner peter jackson the lord of the rings trilogy  complete with great acting brilliant special effects great action scenes and of course the classic story  good acting all around starring academy award winner adrian brody the pianist naomi watts jack black and appearances by many others         it is worth noting that this movie has some of the most spectacular action scenes i have ever seen  beautiful  scenery whether its the dense jungles of skull island or the dazzling backdrop of the early 20th century skyline of new york city the ending on top of the empire state building is nothing short of   outstanding ive come to expect nothing less from peter jackson jackson is to adventure movies what james cameron is to science fiction action movies that is to say they are both the best in my opinion in their respective genres  quite emotional and also a little disturbing in some parts king kong is not a remake that disappoints  although it is long at over 3 hours in length there is not a slow part that i can remember  make sure you have alot of time to kill before you pop it into the dvd player
May 26 2010,neutral,been there seen that
May 26 2010,positive,i loved that movie i cried when king kong got shot off the building lol
May 26 2010,positive,an awesome movieeven though the origanal was betterthis one had more drama and actionand this king kong had more creatures
May 26 2010,negative,em not a fan of huge animal thing film
May 26 2010,positive,this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen back in 2005 i still like the plot from the original and the character development was great kong looked brilliant and the fight scenes were awesome its a pretty long movie but who cares definately go see this movie one of the best hollywood remakes ive ever seen
May 26 2010,negative,this was a huge fail
May 25 2010,negative,jaja ganda ng effects looks so realnakita q narin
May 25 2010,positive,who would have thought jack blacks best role is not a comedy
May 25 2010,positive,jack black plays a serious role and played it to a t yes besides the sorrowful death of the mighty king kong this film was very exciting and fun to watch peter jackson did a fantastic job of creating a rividing remake that turned out better than the original

May 23 2010,positive,the movie to me lacked excietment
May 23 2010,positive,it will never beat the first king kong
May 23 2010,neutral,this movie was far too long the strange thing about this movie is that it feels too long for no apparently reason the closes thing i came to an answer on the matter was that the battles was far very long and at times uninteresting     watching king kong fighting a couple of trexs was not as satisfying as i thought it would it was like as soon as you thought the battle was over the battle continued and when you again thought the battle was about to end it continued i got really tired of it    honestly i didnt really feel i got something i havent seen before other than a computer animated king kong yeah king kong was well done great work     but still the rest of the movie was plain boring and even the last scene between king kong and beauty couldnt save it the film is tiresome in the action scenes and too slow the rest of the time not worthy of jacksons lotrtrilogy
May 23 2010,positive,spectacular on blueray i did have this movie at 3 stars but ive bumped it up by onei enjoyed watching it again
May 22 2010,positive,seen this 2 many times

May 21 2010,positive,this is one of those movies that is very very close to being flawless the action seens are fantastic despite the very high scope the scenes with ann and kong are amazing going from frightening to comedic to dramatic i almost cried at the end but i wont say why in fear of spoiling the movie
May 21 2010,negative,original was much better
May 20 2010,positive,teaches us to have a heart andbe kind
May 20 2010,positive,jack black did a wonderful peformance in  this classic remake of king kong
May 20 2010,positive,saw it 5 times got it too
May 20 2010,positive,yes its long and yes its occasionally strange but its also bloody fantastic     for peter jackson to make a movie almost as good as the lotr trilogy is something magical king kong has a great cast great cinematography and a brilliant story the special effects are fantastic as well especially in the scene with the wormbug things which still creeps out even the most thick skinned individual    for being a monster of a film in almost every way  810    jack xx

May 18 2010,positive,kong is always classic greatness
May 18 2010,positive,when i saw this i finally found a remake made in a very respectable matter later i did hear some people thought this movie was better then the the one that came out in 1933 i would have disagree because that movie is one of my favorite films of all time although it is a good movie but you cant beat the classic 8th wonder of the world
May 18 2010,positive,good remake of an old classic
May 18 2010,neutral,bad plot nice action scenes
May 17 2010,positive,goodgreat job on king kongthose eyes were too real

May 17 2010,neutral,longer than necessary but not bad
May 17 2010,positive,in my opinion this is jacksons best work
May 17 2010,positive,i really like this movie  special effects were good and naomi watts screamed well

May 15 2010,positive,king kong is the best actor in that movie and most of these movies here

May 14 2010,positive,a movie that cant be seen out side of the cinema this an event film that is a chore to watch on tv or dvd blu ray might good to rent if you havent seen it in the cinema
May 13 2010,negative,as much as i love peter jackson this is one case where he really could have made the movie a little shorter its super boring
May 13 2010,positive,a really enjoyable epic with awesome special effectsi love timeperiod films too
May 13 2010,positive,finally a good remake of the 1933 masterpiece  but what else could you expect from the artist known as peter jackson  this movie was done so well that it may be as good as the original  also in this one kong actually looks like a gorilla and not an aborted fetus  this new kong is so human like that you actually start to feel for him  and these emotions make his enevitable demise all the more difficult to bear  king kong 2005 gets 10 tender interspecies moments out of 10  i cried at the end
May 13 2010,positive,sad movies but i like it
May 13 2010,positive,king kong they gave it bad reviews but i totally enjoyed it  king kong is older then must of us but no matter how they remake its always awesome come on its king kong hes the man lol

May 11 2010,neutral,a mediocre movie but it is a well done remake i expected much worse
May 11 2010,positive,i think the funniest part was when king kong broke the trexs neck and then checked to make sure it was broken
May 10 2010,positive,this is what a remake should be like everything you loved about the original is in this movie only longer and more groundbreaking
May 10 2010,positive,yeah it was flawed through casting the pacing was a little off but come on  it was so well done
May 10 2010,positive,love all of the king kong movies  the original is the greatest  but this one was a really great remake
May 10 2010,positive,i love creature features but the monsters story is never mysterious enough

May 7 2010,positive,it was beauty that killed the beast  way back in the 1930s a film known as king kong made a huge impact on the world of movies several remakes were made but many agree they well in a word sucked until now here instead of stop motion cg is used to animate kong he looks more like an actual gorilla but not necisserelly realisitic the woman whos name i cant remember is played by naomi watts who gives an excellent performance sadly the same cant be said for the man that plays the mad director an odd choice was made in jack black i have nothing against him he did great in other movies sadly not here his eyes are always bugging out and hes always in an intense tone making him seem very hammy and not very likeable however i have to admit the actual kong in this film is very good they actually got the actor andy serkis to do motion capture for kongs face despite the fact that kong has no lines you can definitley tell what he is thinking just by his facial expressions but there are some things i didnt like in the movie at one point when naomi watts is trying to tame kong during his attack on new york i wish i was lying here they go are you ready for this ice skating i cant take that seriously  its like ice capades on crack whats next godzilla on broadway and one other thing they decided to spend a lot of time on the boat on their way to the island to long they spent so much time on this dang boat i almost got seasick the final flaw is its length i hate movies that are too long this movie is almost exactly 3 hours long but flaws aside there are somethings i notice in the older movie kong just seems to like the woman for no reason here watts was given as a sacrifice to kong and after showing kong a dance he falls for her that makes alot more sense overall it isnt a perfect 5star movie but its definelty worth watching
May 7 2010,positive,wow  a worthy remake of a classic film
May 7 2010,positive,kamehameha wave anyone
May 7 2010,positive,this is really good finally a good remake its long but amazing love namoi watts and jack black in this film 81
May 7 2010,positive,well here we go remaking what i feel is the greatest american movie ever made    funny story i was at the cinema in brighton when i was going to see this but the tickets had sold out we made a mad dash to crawley roughly 2 hours and just managed to get in the 1630 screening     its probably the only remake of kong that has ever held a candlelight to the original but it still has many flaws    this kong is much more humane and emotional than previous kongs which does work it makes the audience feel greatly sympathetic to what he must be going through out of his habitat and element however i do still feel more sorry for the original kong who has very animalistic movements and acts on instinct more than anything    i think we spent way to long on the boat i was waiting for something to happen but nothing really interesting happened     the cgi looks very good and the acting was pretty much fair  everyone did a pretty good job    final verdict for an update on the legendary tale of beauty and beast the remake holds up pretty nicely worth checking out
May 7 2010,positive,that was a good film
May 7 2010,negative,should have raped the blonde chick and then tryed to see if she could even spell rape the gorrila had no coki was cuntfused

Apr 26 2010,neutral,ok but a little creepy for me
Apr 26 2010,positive,peter jackson has proven once again that he knows what hes doing king kong is an epic adventure that consistently surprises in the wrong hands the jaw dropping visuals could have distracted from the story but in this case they only enhance it jackson takes the original and rips it a new one  providing more action and intensity that will surely keep you on edge the powerful score composed by james newton howard only helps setting the perfect tone some may not appreciate the three hour running time but it provided some much needed character development kong is brilliant the era is well presented the characters are believable and the cg is incredible this is how remakes are done
Apr 26 2010,positive,this was a good movesremake and jack black was awesome but it seemed to drag on for ever and ever the addded dinos were cool and the characters were cool   rating a
Apr 26 2010,positive,astonishing little adventure story amazing film

Apr 22 2010,neutral,peter jacksons update of king kong is ambitious and boasts spectacular visual effects and andy serkis brilliant motion capture performance as the titular ape but the movie itself was unnecessarily overlong and weightdown by a slew of uninteresting side characters

Apr 17 2010,positive,just as good as the original
Apr 17 2010,negative,the biggest thing on the screen wasnt the twentyfive foot ape but peter jacksons ego   foldedspaceorg    not only does this film stand tall and proud in the ranks of unnecessary remakes peter jacksons king kong is a testament to peter jacksons audacity to claim people are annoyed by remakes et cetera when all hes ever done is make adaptations of other peoples work you see he says that people want original ideas but yet here he is with his constant adaptations of other peoples work what a guy peter jackson is maybe hell start making his own movies again unless we want him to return to mediocre bmovies for the record i never bought into the hype over the lotr series of movies theres a lot of movies id rather watch than those  peter jacksons king kong is way too long to start off with its essentially the same movie as the 1933 version but spun out to 187 minutes as opposed to the original 100 minutes so what do we get for our extra 87 minutes absolutely nothing of value other than yet another goddamn remake because hollywoods too lazy these days to come up with anything else  did we really need three hours about a story that was hardly as long to begin with howwhenwhere did jack blacks character obtain that map and why didnt he seem up set when he lost it it was winter in new york city and naomi watts character was walking around in an thin gown and we dont even see her breath she doesnt so much as shiver as she stands on the top of the empire state building and why didnt the pond that king kong slid around on so much as creak the army just showed up minutes after king kong escapes and then starts blasting apart the city how can a petite woman like naomi watts ever survive being held in kongs hand while fighting three trex or running at about 50 mph through a dense jungle they say you need to turn your brain off sometimes i suspended disbelief until my suspension ran out beasties are one thing but physics and physiology are an entire different thing altogether  why doesnt kong bleed at all after being bitten by trexs on his arm to the bone several times why is ann darrow shown to be in love with the monster we know as king kong whats next a japanese girl wants to love godzilla there were the apatosaurs stampeding and the humans were suddenly too stupid to move off to the side forget that apatosaurs were solitary animals never traveled in herds were rarely near water and moved no faster than a human walking  peter jackson decided that he didnt have to build suspense because everyone has seen the original there was no suspense in this movie yes we all know for the most part what king kong is going to do but all of the time i spent heading to the end seemed so shallow and cheap the original film was a winner artistic popular long lasting something to be proud of jacksons adaptation is just pointless and unnecessary drivel a precursor to the shit bomb known as the lovely bones  you dont have to force yourself to like this movie just because peter jackson directed it i am really tired of people licking his balls im sure plenty of directors under the sun can adapt already existing material a book or an old film and make it a good movie if given the right budget and if they have the dedication and ability but i digress   im surprised jack black ventured out of comedy in this film but its a shame he had to use this film to do just that then again its a shame peter jackson couldnt just stick to hobbits and orcs because thats all it seems hes good for in the end  like emmerichs godzilla ended up making godzilla fans calling the godzilla therein and rightfully so godzilla in name only peter jacksons king kong is king kong in name only  one last thing needs to be said before i go not only is this probably the worst king kong film around but it makes me wonder if peter jacksons just going to end up as a one hit wonder in the end the next george lucas and looking at king kong and lovely bones its definately looking that way
Apr 17 2010,positive,great adventure wild crazy virgin island good piture i like it

Apr 13 2010,positive,this was a great movie
Apr 13 2010,positive,i own this movie it was a pretty good remake except that it was very long
Apr 13 2010,negative,with the technology available for special effects this could have been a great movie unfortunately it wasnt sadly this movie just proves the point that good effects do not a good movie make    what happened here is that a film with enough plot to last for the time of the original was stretched out to try fill 3 hours of screen time and the result is disastrous in addition its pretty clear that cgi nerds and video game designers had way too much input into this atrocity    it can all be summarized with a top 10 list of the worst scenesmistakes of the movie    10 the time wasting overly long irrelevant plot line surrounding ann darrow the old man and the theater getting closed down not pertinent to the story    9 the cgi nerd focus on the spinning airplane wheels on the fighter planes someone said isnt this the coolest thing youve ever seen it only lasted a few seconds but it was there only because some gigantic nerd wanted it in guess what its not cool    8 the plot line surrounding jimmy and mr hayes unnecessary irrelevant and ultimately unresolved why was hayes protective of jimmy did jimmy go on to make something of himself we never know why did anyone have to know he read heart of darkness or any of the other nonsense that was discussed between them total waste of time stalls the story    7 kong violently shaking ann around after he gets to his home turf and her suffering no ill effects shed be not only injured but dead kong was supposed to be gentle with ann duh totally missed the point    6 the time wasting overly long irritating scenes where kong repeatedly roars for no good reason cgi nerdseffects people are responsible im certain they obviously took over the whole movie probable discussion isnt the roar the coolest thing youve ever seenheard lets use it 47 times    5 the completely ludicrous scene where kong smashes the stolen taxi but driscoll inside isnt even scratched guess what thats right hed be dead come on you can at least try to make this thing believable    4 the completely awful scene where kong fights 3 trexes while holding anne in his hand for the love of god shed be killed instantly at least the original had the sense to have him put her down to fight the tyrannosaurus a key element ignored in the remake here and elsewhere in the movie they also miss the point about the planes holding back when kong is holding ann see above point missed    and the top 3    3 the incredibly preposterous and insulting scene where jimmy shoots all the cgi nerd created insects off of driscoll shuts his eyes while firing and hits all the bugs it wasnt just reminiscent of jarjar binks in the big battle with the gun stuck on his tail it was jarjar binks in the big battle with the gun stuck on his tail totally unacceptable    2 the even more preposterous and more insulting and asinine brontosaurus stampede scene this one almost takes the cake for worst scene in movie history if not for the next one beyond ridiculous totally unbelievable videogame quality graphics cheesy and unrealistic cgi nerds were probably slapping high fives seeing how many asinine nearmiss raptor almost gets the character before being stomped by the brontosaurus tom and jerry scenes they could create asinine beyond belief    1 the horrible horrible ridiculous scene where kong and ann et all are falling through the vines getting caught repeatedly by new vines swinging out not getting injured falling again caught by another swinging vine not getting injured etc vines pendulumlike swinging with the monster almost gobbling ann up only to be just out of reach repeatedly this didnt belong in king kong it belonged in donkey kong jr    if you removed all this irrelevant nonsense what would remain might not have been that bad it would probably be quite good in fact sadly it was left in its hard to imagine how insufferable a dvd directors cut could be    on the positive side naomi watts was excellent as was jack black the acting in general was a positive no real complaints there and the animation of kong himself was excellent very well done    sadly though very little of the movie involved acting it was all about making it a big video game and putting in all the effects the effects are not themselves the movie they are there to support the movie    to summarize there were a lot of good pieces but there were also a lot of bad ones ultimately too many were used and a lot of them did not belong
Apr 13 2010,positive,very good loved it

Apr 10 2010,negative,as with most movies that have been remade several times with no improvements this was no exception the kong moments looked cool but the story was watered down and the rest of the cast was boring at best i loved the original king kong didnt hate the remake of the 80s and hated this one the only thing they improved were the effects    acting    story    plot    effects    overall        you didnt even try  sucktastic  hated it    you tried but didnt quite make it  didnt like it    average  tolerated it    good job you really tried  i liked it    you are freakin awesome  i loved it

Apr 5 2010,positive,king kong is a beautiful and affectionate remake of one of the most respected movies ever made the casting is perfect the visual effects are outstanding and while the film might be about 2030 minutes too long whats here is brilliant    the final sequence is beautiful and the insect attack about halfway through is frightening and chilling i cared about the characters and while this film isnt as revolutionary as the original its just as good

Apr 4 2010,positive,there were so many versions of this film and this in my opinion is the best naomi watts is charming and beautiful as hell in the lead with a good supporting cast and absolutely amazing techs
Apr 3 2010,positive,this movie was so deeply disturbing not even half way through the movie i found myself feeling compassion for kong     but unfortunely it had quite a few racial stereo types   as for the cast i think andy serkis deserved an oscar nomination at least jack black did very well as a crazy director who would stop at nothing to finish his film but i dont think naomi watts colin hanks or jamie bell had very much to do       but personally i liked the beast better than adrian brody and in my humble opinion kong should have lived and brody could have stayed on the skull island

Mar 30 2010,negative,seen it hated it not my type of film
Mar 30 2010,positive,very good moviei love it
Mar 29 2010,positive,peter jackson had a hard challenge trying to make a film to follow up his lord of the rings masterpiece  king kong defiantly didnt trump it but it sure is one hell of a movie with breathtaking visuals great story eve if it is adapted and good acting this film is a pretty great remake  we take the story of the original king kong were a run up director jack black gets ahold of a map to skull island and tricks his crew to sailing there he brings aboard screenwriter jack driscoll adrien brody and beautiful ann darrow naomi watts who plays the actress who after being kidnapped by the skull islanders who are quite scary is offered to kong and the rest of the story we know what makes this movie is the visuals almost all of it is cgi and it works the scenery is like a painted picture and it is stunning the action sequences are fantastic and thrilling and you wont be disappointed with that the movies length is a problem for some people its at about 3 hours and 10 minutes there were maybe one or two scenes i thought they could have done without but at the same time those scene capture the development of the characters so well that it makes you feel for them so much more    so if you got three hours to spare i suggest watching this movie it is a great thrill ride

Mar 29 2010,negative,good but not my taste
Mar 29 2010,positive,not much of a peter jackson fan although his earlier films such as heavenly creatures and dead alive were pretty interesting but this was pretty all right whatever that means putting it back into the setting of the 1930s when the original king kong was released was a great idea
Mar 29 2010,positive,loved the extended blue ray version  definitely a collectible
Mar 29 2010,negative,peter jackson once again proves that his expertise solely lies with digital visual direction even though king kong 2005 is undeniably stunning artistically the negative aspects of the film outweigh the positive while the talent the film collected put across decent performances particularly naomi watts and jack black it is obvious that jackson gives them little direction for their roles and the result is a haphazard set of characterizations that fall flat with audiences especially during the tedious interludes between action scenes most depressingly though the director shamelessly rehashes the original but fails to capture the lovehate relationship between man and nature that kong embodies ultimately jackson turns one of the most complex characters in cinema history into air bud

Feb 25 2010,positive,i had a chance to watch this when i was akid
Feb 25 2010,positive,wow i want 2 see that
Feb 25 2010,positive,this is probably the best rendition of king kong were ever going to see with an emotional story great acting and amazing special effects personally i was quite surprised at jack blacks acting  he pulled off dramatic scenes very well and the trademark jack black sense of humor was present as well the length of the movie while considered to be long by some seems just right to me capturing all necessary elements of the story and showcasing much of skull islands lesshospitable inhabitants which is to say all of them the epic size of the movie makes sense because in king kong everything is huge which leads me to another point there is as much a thriller aspect to the movie as adventure and all of the creatures on skull island are extremelely frightening giant mosquitos excluded especially the raptors the dinosaur scenes were brilliantly done mixing humor with huge stampeding herbivores and bloodthirsty carnivorous predators the acting in king kong was good  i have no complaints but the emotional scenes actually show up with king kong and ann darrow watts king kong shows jacksons growing skill at making the audience feel sympathetic and even connected to nonhuman characters    dont let its length fool you king kong is a great movie from start to finish
Feb 25 2010,positive,peter jackson is just simply amazing
Feb 25 2010,positive,the first ever movie i watched and remembered
Feb 24 2010,positive,only part to me that gets 5 stars is when they are on the island
Feb 24 2010,positive,you can really tell that peter jackson was a fan of the origional king kong as the attention he paid to details in this film are extrodinary its really entertaining and unlike most people i had no problem with the length however that being said it loses points for haveing one too many situations where the protaginists escape by the seat of their pants and by one i mean twenty
Feb 24 2010,positive,great remake fantastic
Feb 24 2010,positive,i complain about avatar and gladiator being too long but i dont yell at this why
Feb 24 2010,negative,hollywood have never learned that things with monkeys apes or the like almost always ends bad
Feb 24 2010,positive,awesome movie  attracts you
Feb 23 2010,neutral,i did not like how it drug on and on towards end
Feb 23 2010,positive,peter jackson you know him right  he did lord of the ringsand lord of the ringsoh and just recently the lord of the rings decides to take classic awe inspiring king kong and decides todosomething with it     visually the movie looks good  exactly what a king kong remake should be  the scenery in skull island actually had me losing myself in the wonder of king konguntil he fought dinosaurs then i was right back to being cynical but hey i then told myself  if id buy giant gorillas i should take anything jackson is going to show for the next few hours    casting for the film feelsodd  jack blacks presence felt a tad forced as if that needed to be filled with some one with comedic background although it didnt really call for it  naomi watts was fine but i couldnt bring myself to like adrian brody  it might just be me but i find him really unsettling really antiscreen chemistry      do you need to see this film  i wouldnt say so but if you have time to spare i say you give it a good netflixing
Feb 23 2010,neutral,its fun to watch aint boring at all
Feb 23 2010,neutral,long  another unnecessary remake  puke

Feb 21 2010,positive,i enjoyed it but didnt at the same time not one of jack blacks best
Feb 20 2010,negative,ok cute when he twirls namony around on the lakein the ice
Feb 20 2010,positive,effects just as incredible as jacksons lord of the rings trilogy and does justice to the original but a little too long
Feb 20 2010,positive,i used to think this was the best movie in the worldthen i watched it again
Feb 20 2010,positive,i love the original version
Feb 20 2010,neutral,i always thought the original was overrated bad actingdialogue really racistremember the china man on the ship really was just a rip of the lost world with a giant monkey most people only remember the last 15 minutes of the originalwhich were awesome but block out the rest the remake was better but jack black and adrien brody are two people who annoy the fuck out of me way way over the top in places and about 45 minutes to long
Feb 20 2010,negative,too long and drawn out  it was repetitive and the ending was boring
Feb 20 2010,positive,ridiculously boring in the majority of parts despite this the cgi is commendable

Feb 16 2010,positive,for those who said kong shoulnt be done again this film is made great by a dedicated approach to honoring the original while charting its own path  taking the well known story and using a script actors direction sfx et al to breathenew life into kong peter jackson shows his success with the ring triology wasno fluke  compare this to the 70s abomination and you willunderstand
Feb 16 2010,positive,i like the original best
Feb 16 2010,positive,many didnt like the peter jackson version of king kong but i applaud itdespite a very miscast jack black i am a huge fan of the original and i believe that jackson was attempting to do a fitting hommage to that first film and doing a pretty good job of it
Feb 16 2010,positive,although its incredibly remarkably excessive length may cloud some viewers opinions on a wonderful story and a legendary character
Feb 16 2010,positive,not what i expected but its alright
Feb 16 2010,negative,i really didnt like it it takes too much time to show some action

Feb 16 2010,negative,so so so so the end of the world

Feb 13 2010,negative,please dont make another king kong
Feb 13 2010,neutral,quite impressive special effectsbut nothing else
Feb 13 2010,neutral,this was not a totally terrible update of the original story but it was bad i really want to give this a positive rating i really do and i want to not hate this movie but i still feel like peter jackson just didnt do it justice at the end of the day  the graphics were absolutely amazing id say they are some of the best cgi there is out there  and the movie falls into the trap that great special effects lies a lot of great visuals very little character and story development  jack black really surprised me i was glad that he was able to play the part and not butcher the big line at the end of the film but the lack of an engaging screenplay is a major downfall  and the director turned the passion kong feels into a majorly strange phenomenon they start to actually start flirting  and of course i have to acknowledged that they more than doubled the length of the film they dragged out the original 90 minute story to a full 3 hours what the hell i mean length rarely bothers me but 3 hours of action is not the same as 3 hours of entertainment what were they thinking  so impressive performances and great action and special effects but it was excessively long had a relatively weak story structure and was fairly strange all in all it did not do the original story justice  510
Feb 12 2010,negative,it was an hour too long  especially the fight with the trexes

Feb 8 2010,negative,why did they make this
Feb 8 2010,positive,peter jackson has always been great at making epic films and this is no exception its three hours long but still worthy of multiple viewings the whole cast in this is excellent but jack black is the biggest surprise here never thought he could pull off such a sensational performance but he does just that here    the action and the special effects are just breathtaking the fight scene between king kong and the trexs is just awesome and quite possibly my most favorite scene in the movie however every action sequence is amazing and very wellmade and definitely makes this long movie very well worth the time
Feb 8 2010,positive,good refreshed version of old classic

Feb 7 2010,positive,this is a good movie
Feb 7 2010,positive,i want the last face you see in this world to be the face of love so you look at me when they do this thing ill be the face of love for you    that is a line from the movie dead man walking sister helen prejean says it to matthew poncelot on his way to be executed by people who only see him as a monster    dead man walking is the true story of a nun committed to the soul of a convicted murderer on death row    this line is said just as powerfully in king kong although it is not spoken ms darrow says it to kong with her eyes and actions    she is a symbol of beauty against the beast of man when everyone else runs away from what they dont understand she runs towards it ann is constantly running to kong she doesnt spend her time trying to convince her friends or the government that kong is a good ape she knows she cant do anything to save him so she tries to ensure that he experiences love and kindness before he meets his fate    jesus said the poor will always be with us what is our role for the suffering and the isolated how do we rescue those who are being attacked and mistreated for some i imagine its to try to dictate change from the inside to be a voice of influence in political and social circles for others like ann darrow it is to suffer alongside the oppressed it is to be the face of love in the midst of hate    ann is countercultural running towards suffering and danger she is doing something that would cause others to think is foolish the firefighters running up a building closer to the flames and destruction peacemaker teams being the middle man between two warring countries knowing they may be hated by both sides    kong is persecuted and judged and attacked man sees something different than what theyre comfortable with and react with an instinct which cannot be trusted if we feel like someone is not on our side we get defensive since a good defense is a good offense attacking is our reaction to our insecurities    in the movie solaris a team of astronauts start to experience something they do not understand it doesnt appear to be human so they see it as threatening and want to get rid of it one of the scientists has this to say    we take off into the cosmos ready for anything   solitude hardship exhaustion death were proud of ourselves but when you think about it our enthusiasms a sham we dont want other worlds we want mirrors    why is familiarity so comforting and new ideas so scary maybe something that appears threatening is actually full of love how do we get past our preconceived ideas of good and evil what have we allowed ourselves to be manipulated by    i think its ok to react in fear at first ms darrow reacts in fear when kong kidnaps her its how we react to our reactions that can help define who we are after the initial shock wore off she was able to look in kongs eyes and see something that wanted to protect her like a father someone who would risk his life for hers she couldnt see that from a distance running away or shooting guns she had to be close if we keep our distance its safer if we dont get to know someone its easier to judge who they are based on what we think they should be    the message of king kong is especially relevant today in this time of war we use words like insurgents serving as a barrier which allows us to justify not caring for another human being they dig their own grave we say its easier to see someone on death row get what they deserve then to wish them life    the real life sister helen from the dead man walking story talks about accompanying a man to execution    you are in this building in the middle of the night and all these people are organized to kill this man and the gospel comes to you as it never has before are you for compassion or are you for violence are you for mercy or are you for vengeance are you for love or are you for hate are you for life or are you for death  sister helen prejean    sometimes thoughtful questions are better than hateful answers i would hope that i am for life and will leave the question in my head until the right answer comes out of my heart
Feb 7 2010,positive,a little long but great action excellent remake

Jan 27 2010,positive,finally a modernday king kong movie after king kong  king kong lives in the 70s80s there seened no hope left in the story this was of course until peter jackson came along and took it up to a new notch    the special effecty are truley amazing and the acting in my opinion was even better i loved naomi watts as ann darrow as she played the part with true emmotion    the thing that only got it a 90 rather than 100 was the rushed ending as the original took more time over the end than the plot itself however the fact that it included new characters subplots and creatures from the original book were fantastic

Jan 20 2010,positive,a great remake to the great original king kong proves that not all remakes are bad director peter jackson turned kong into a great 3 hour epic film with state of the art effects jack black naomi watts and adrien brody help bring out the films dramatic side this version of kong is much more than a horror film that the original is but a dramatic adventure epic
Jan 20 2010,negative,i still have yet to be able to make it through the entirety of this movie  not a good sign for someone that can watch most any movie once
Jan 20 2010,positive,great homage to a great original movie
Jan 20 2010,positive,really long but good
Jan 20 2010,negative,hated it it was all speacial affects
Jan 19 2010,positive,king kong is a classic tale im not sure how it was originally told but the way peter jackson told it was excellent   the way this 3 hour movie starts is with an hour of character developement if you watch this at night youre bound to fall asleep once they finally hit the island where kong lives things start to pick up really fast around half way through the movie you finally see kong   the visually effects of this movie were outstanding the story was great the action was very cool overall its a mustsee movie and all worth an hour of talking

Jan 17 2010,positive,stays true to the original in all ways if this updated classic doesnt cut it for current audiences thats more of a commentary on audiences today than it is on this film

Jan 17 2010,positive,little drawn out in parts  over all bery good
Jan 17 2010,negative,touching but nonsense
Jan 17 2010,neutral,great special effects but the movie does not seem to quite come together
Jan 16 2010,positive,it came free with the hddvd addon i bought for my xbox 360 a few years back not that i honestly thought hddvd had a chance of winning the format war but because back then i had the money to throw away on things like that    the movie was great i think people went expecting to see something else length was a none issue as the story was captivating enough to hold your attention and when you felt said attention starting to slip you got a big monster battle to keep you watching    the movie itself was the bet but it sure was far from the worst it was one hell of a technological achievement and is still awe inspiring with several beautifully realized landscape shots that gave the movie somewhat of a fantastical feeling compared to the original    if the movie could keep my attention while under the influence of sleeping medication and already having the attention span of a goldfish in a fishbowl surrounded by a 360degree mirror  if you couldnt keep your attention towards the movie you might want to go seek medical help
Jan 16 2010,positive,hehe that big gorilla will never get old jack black and naomi watts did outstanding

Jan 13 2010,positive,the original is a classic that will be cherished forever however after the dreadful second remake this film seems like it stands alone as its own classic this is an amazing film and it is one that could be remade 5 times more as long as they keep going this route people complain about it being too long but it seemed like it needed all of that time to get a great story across and that is exactly what it has done
Jan 13 2010,positive,great special effects fantastic on blue ray not 5 because of the long boring boat journey that does not need to be there and lets the film down

Dec 31 2009,positive,awesome who ever made this movie is a genius i liked it that much  putting gorillas and dinosaurs together made this movie extra excitingthankyou
Dec 31 2009,positive,king kong is a classic piece of american cinema unfortunately i have never had the pleasure of seeing the original that was released in 1933 the only other king kong i have seen is the 1976 version starring jeff bridges honestly i wasnt very impressed by the 76 kong therefore i never had any motivation to check out the older one that said this king kong film is the only one i have to base my knowledge of the story on i cannot be a judge of how truthful it stays to the original but what i can say is that it was exciting whether or not it is a faithful remake    who better to direct a massive 3 hour story about a massive ape than the man who made me fall in love with middle earth yes peter jackson was probally one of the best things about this film he may make very long movies but at least they are also very entertaining movies king kong does tend to run on quite a bit due to possibly unnecesary scenes like giant bugs for exapmle i cant say for sure that they were unnecesary because they may have been in the original films then i would just sound stupid for calling them unnecesary thank god they had the presence of mind to reserve some stuff for an extended edition though    even with the footage some might call unnecesary i still found very much to appreciate in the story i know the first thing alot of people say is cgi takes away from a good story but definitely not this one i have trouble enjoying pictures nowadays when the monsters are stop motion like both of the older king kongs so it was a fresh take to see him done so realistically with modern technology before it took over hollywood kong himself is so realistic i had a hard time getting over how beautifully he was created everything from a wound he got in battle to wet fur was gorgeous it was an especially nice touch when he would breath on ann and her hair would blow in the air current    i also have to say that i was pleasantly surprised to see jack black in a more serious role some may disagree with me but i think he did a fine job as did both naomi watts and adrian brody none of the actors are more intriguing than kong though so while king kong is far from a perfect film i believe peter jackson and his team did a fantastic job of bringing this classic to a modern audience many people think that classics should never be remade but i say if the movies are really that good filmmakers should reintroduce them to younger generations with a modern look otherwise i would never have known the story of king kong beyond the fact that hes a giant ape
Dec 30 2009,neutral,although this movie is a classic it was not up to my expectation it was drawn out far to long
Dec 30 2009,neutral,alright not the best in the world

Dec 29 2009,neutral,for me this one was a big disappointment the original was much better tipical hollywood commercial remake i expect better from jackson    note just a few incoherent scenes   everybody has tommy guns very very expensive guns just becose they are cool the long trex fight with kong is ridiculous the taxi chase is a joke    ps sorry for my bad english

Dec 28 2009,positive,haha i liked this movie
Dec 28 2009,positive,i like this movie  
Dec 28 2009,positive,this was not the greatest version but it was better than piece of crap 1976 version but the superior version in my opinion is the 1933 so if i was you i look mor into rkos version
Dec 27 2009,positive,graphix was mad peter jacson well done dude

Dec 27 2009,positive,one of the best movie that have been done over
Dec 27 2009,positive,the boys love this movie
Dec 27 2009,positive,the best movie i have ever seen
Dec 26 2009,negative,cgi special effects get better and more convincing all the time no wonder this hit movie was praised  but the sappy dead serious nature of this peter jackson directorial annoyed me more than the computer effects impressed me  in addition the old beauty killed the beast message might have been okay in the rko original but in this remake its painfully dated  why not have a message about how mankind should stop  taking endangered species out of their environment unless its to improve the species population  despite aweinspiring visuals i felt this pretentious bastardization missed the mark
Dec 26 2009,negative,a bit too long and slowboring for me
Dec 26 2009,positive,good movie great effects
Dec 26 2009,positive,a deep emotional story covered by one of the most impressive display of visual effects in recent cinema history  peter jacksons king kong soars high with his team of weta and the prodigal andy serkis

Dec 26 2009,positive,the movie started boring  slow
Dec 26 2009,positive,just too much it didnt help my opinion of jack black either  he is always the weak link of any film he is in
Dec 25 2009,negative,the remake is the most stupidest movie ever
Dec 25 2009,positive,really good but too long
Dec 25 2009,positive,works perfectly on all levels but lacks much of the charm of the original and curiously even much of the charm of the 1976 jessica lange version  by charm in the latter i mean the waterfall sequence of course
Dec 25 2009,positive,the origina  best heartfelt version
Dec 25 2009,negative,ive watched this for 1000 times andthis movie is boring
Dec 25 2009,positive,could have been better
Dec 24 2009,positive,i like this film documentary 
Dec 24 2009,positive,the beauty kill the beast
Dec 24 2009,positive,i love all of the king kong flicks
Dec 24 2009,positive,a riproaring spectacle full of exciting and highly original action scenes the piece  de  resistance is a fight which has kong versus a group of ferocious trexs although it is quite a long film the establishing scenes are necessary to help give the characters some grounding and a certain degree of depth peter jackson has proven that he is a highly gifted filmmaker the question i asked myself after watching it was what would audiences back in 1933 when the original came out have thought of this film
Dec 24 2009,positive,in 1933 new york an overly ambitious movie producer coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to mysterious skull island where they encounter kong a giant ape who is immediately smitten with leading lady ann darrow
Dec 23 2009,negative,waste of a good name
Dec 23 2009,positive,i like it and it was sad at the end
Dec 23 2009,neutral,umm not that good a bit borig 
Dec 23 2009,positive,king kong is a film that produced to be include comedy action and romantic elements    over all tell a story about animal desire  the desire of cofidenceself portect and grace    in order to show a probably truth that we may live in normal but in the end we all in the way of self journeya journey of mind and heart
Dec 23 2009,positive,if the one from the 70s was good and a bit sad
Dec 23 2009,positive,so good i purchased it
Dec 23 2009,positive,beauty and the beast always a great love story
Dec 23 2009,positive,it was a good movie 
Dec 23 2009,positive,peter jackson what a hero probably didnt want to do it but i loved it all the same
Dec 23 2009,negative,animal movies mostly bore except this 
Dec 22 2009,negative,this has the honor of being the first and only movie ive fallen asleep during at the theater
Dec 22 2009,negative,ok but not the kind of movie i would stay and watch again
Dec 22 2009,negative,wanted more from this film
Dec 22 2009,neutral,i bet women love this stuff the big bad man that is sweet with her and has the guts to fight but then hes castrated and told to fold your legs dear
Dec 22 2009,negative,i hate when the monkey dies
Dec 22 2009,positive,amazing effects pj rules
Dec 22 2009,positive,brilliant remake that manages to improve over that terrible 1976 attempt and be as good as the original classic peter jackson delivers an exciting if overlong and brilliant reincarnation of a masterpiece
Dec 22 2009,positive,while it may run a bit too long for the average moviegoer peter jackson manages to take one of the most iconic films in cinematic history and make it his own with enough drama and wit to go around and spectacular visuals that still hold up today king kong ends up being highly entertaining and increasingly memorable and let us not forget andy serkis adrien brody and jack black who all respectively steal the show
Dec 22 2009,neutral,cos i neva watched it and i cant be bothered to read about it
Dec 21 2009,positive,many people dislike this movie because of its running time this i feel added to the story which can immerse you in wonder and i feel that it was visually stunning
Dec 21 2009,positive,i really like so much
Dec 21 2009,positive,what a perfect selection for a remake the old version contained such poor quality now that there is an updated visually stunning film it will draw audiences of all ages that werent interested the story is great acting okay but the effects are simply out of this world
Dec 21 2009,positive,waz a good movie jack black waz good in it
Dec 21 2009,positive,one of my favourite stories  jackson manages to bring it to life in a very respectful and moving way visually stunning with lots of action my only critic would be the too many long shots of watts staring opened mouthed into the distance a beautiful film though which i can watch and enjoy from any point
Dec 20 2009,positive,luv dis movii 2also makes me wanna cry at da end  
Dec 20 2009,positive,saw this last night
Dec 20 2009,positive,it was good very long
Dec 20 2009,positive,very good action movie about king kong if you like him an a good figt scene where king kong fights a trex
Dec 20 2009,positive,king kong was for me was a visually thrilling action filled adventure quest with subtle drops of cheap love and aboveaverage acting mixed in but when you look at it nothing beats a gigantic monkey ripping 3 huge lizards a new one    jack black does a good job acting when he isnt wearing tights and making people laugh as he does in most of his films he makes you laugh ponder and sometimes swear as he makes his way from nothing to near death to fame to loss throughout the film    this was an eyecandy of its age film with brilliant detail spent on even the smallest of hairs on the great body of the kong with beautiful environments filled with stunning creatures whats not to love    sometimes the characters get too wrapped up in their seriousness or sense of dread and i was confused as to where the lava came from on the natives gigantic wallbut overall a b movie
Dec 19 2009,positive,one of the best remake of all times
Dec 19 2009,positive,visually stunning and great acting gets let down by its length and jacksons addiction to the slow motion camera
Dec 19 2009,positive,not the best movie but still great
Dec 19 2009,negative,not much of a fan of big giant apes
Dec 19 2009,positive,peter fucking jackson  however adrian brody wtf
Dec 19 2009,positive,king kong certainly does have its moments of greatness what else was to expect from the director who before dazzled the world with peter jacksons the lord of the rings trilogy most of the emotions work out well in the movie but are perhaps not as powerful as they truly could had been this is because the movie suffers from some flawed storytelling and a flawed story in general the editing and pace is lacking at times which does make the movie a bit tiresome to watch at moments the movie begins promising but after that it drags for the about next 45 minutes at certain points when characters get divided or splitup the story doesnt feel as a whole and every characters seems to play a role in their own personal movie that were all thrown together again in the editing room to make one movie out of it makes the way the story is told feel absolutely weak and flawed at certain moments but the visuals of the movie are splendid even though the movie didnt really gave a typical 1930s feeling the actors in the movie are good the movie could had been so much more powerful and certainly more realistic if they had only spend more time on the script and gave the other characters also some more screen time instead of just mainly only focusing on ann darrow and kong the movie is a summer blockbuster and of course the story comes secondary however the movie suffers from its flawed story and storytelling its so obvious that the story is just almost totally empty and the movie is nothing more than one spectacular but yet unlikely event after the other the movie forgets about its story at times and try too hard to impress the viewers with its special effects and other visuals it makes the movie too artificial and forced to watch at times the movie still remains almost perfectly entertaining to watch just because so much spectacular happens some of the action is impressive and unforgettable but really the movie deserved a better story and character treatment
Dec 19 2009,positive,peter jacksons take on the 1933 classic is an exhilarating visually exciting and emotionally compelling experience jackson takes good care of his characters developing each character very well throughout the eventless first hour of the film i really didnt mind the lack of events in the first hour because i knew that jackson was developing each character for a reason and it would all pay off in the final 90 minutes oh man it truly did you really felt like you knew these characters so when some of them died it was heartbreaking when the actor came out to be a coward you laughed because of how arrogant he was in the opening of the film jack blacks filmmaker character was great because he needed this footage and nobody how dangerous things got he kept rolling the film its quite amusing at times finally we get to the two most important human characters jack and anne played wonderfully by naomi watts and adrien brody they generate some slight but obvious chemistry in the opening of the film and when watts is kidnapped jacks heroic actions prove that he loves her much like the original the most impressive part of this film is the wonderful special effects king kong is incredibly realistic and the 1930s new york city that they created was breathtaking the ending of this film is almost shot for shot of the original kong falls and the legendary concluding line it was beauty killed the beast
Dec 19 2009,positive,not a bad movie no no definitely not got to have some patience to watch very thrilling in the middle period once it leaves skull island the movies not really so good
Dec 18 2009,positive,irrespective of beign the ability to love is inburn
Dec 18 2009,positive,fantastic enough said
Dec 18 2009,positive,the first half was really interesting but the second half was stupid

Dec 18 2009,positive,good movie but i hate whwn kk is murdered
Dec 18 2009,positive,a great remake of an old classic
Dec 18 2009,negative,seen it once and never wanna c it again
Dec 18 2009,positive,its awsome but sad which makes it good
Dec 18 2009,neutral,its not a horrible film but the story could have been written better i would have preferred a modernday time instead of a 50s setting while the special effects are amazing the story is very mindnumbing which is why it kinda sucks
Dec 17 2009,positive,groundbreaking special effects and an epic scope combined with a great score and excellent performaces make peter jacksons vision of king kong a triumph
Dec 17 2009,positive,very interesting and touching film
Dec 17 2009,positive,where it does prove that modernizing an old film does not make it better a strong female lead does make for an interesting reimagining of the classic tale at least for the first half of the film its when the setting switches to new york that it tries too hard to generate sympathetic emotion
Dec 17 2009,positive,a good movie in my books
Dec 17 2009,positive,carnage sweet carnage
Dec 17 2009,negative,not as good as first one
Dec 17 2009,positive,a fine remake peter jacksons direction is wonderful as are the effects
Dec 17 2009,negative,absolutely shite fell asleep during it its far too long
Dec 17 2009,positive,all time classic seen every remake of this movie loved them all
Dec 16 2009,positive,its nice i cried in this movie
Dec 16 2009,positive,carl denham ladies and gentlemen i give you kong the eighth wonder of the world    peter jackson has always done an excellent job at making some diehard epic films this movie is epic and highly entertaining in every way its a long movie even going past the 3 hour mark but overall still well worth the time    the whole cast in this great naomi watts once again delivers an excellent performance adrien brody does a great job as well never thought jack black could deliver such a strong performance seeing all the comedies he has done but he does just that as well overall this movie is very strongly acted    if you are familiar with the king kong story itself then the plot should hold no surprises for you however it still is a great plot in every way as peter jackson does an incredible job with skull island and amazing visual style used here the fight scene between kong and the tyrannosaurus rexs is epic overall this is still a great epic to watch with exhilarating action and excellent performances
Dec 16 2009,positive,we could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were traveling in the night of first ages of those ages that are gone leaving hardly a sign  and no memories we are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster but there  there you could look at a thing monstrous and free     there is something amazing about king kong other than its entertainment factor and the wrongly cast adrien brody and jack black its how clever peter jacksons direction is not talking about the camera movements or anything but the depth he brings to the film king kong can be separated in three partsall very different from one another in terms of events and also in tones    first the film begins in new york city 1933 its the big depression its hard to get by find food and stuff naomi watts is a struggling stage actress the film is slowlypaced maybe referring to the rhythm of the movies of that era which turned off a lot of people right away but jackson is making an important statement right there this is not lord of the rings and anybody expecting that well  i wont say it it has the social commentary and its good stuff even the opening credits look like the ones in the 30s and is actually a tribute to the original merian copper film the mood is set its slow and calm like the calm before the storm they all get on a boat to go to a secretly hidden island they want to shot a film on location brody is the writer and black is the director we get relationship development between the characters on their way including a teenager reading joseph conrads heart of darkness and the film makes very little parallel with the tone of the book    second they get on the island thats where peter jackson comes in with his very own style a mix of quirks action humor and violence giant insects tones of dinosaurs and the giant ape there are some very entertaining moments here it last forever and we get out of this part out of breathe but its alright cause there are some amazingly stunning visual effects and some funny bits jackson doesnt shy away and kills off lots of secondary characters and make his action heroes think the same way characters used to think in old movies its unlike the heroes of todays movies which is annoying and unrealistic in a way but also very refreshing and enjoyable    third they get back to new york with the giant ape its a wonder how they brought it back or even how they managed to get it on board but we dont care do we  that part is simply a poetic vision its actually the perspective of kong himself he is lost but also in love with a human which is kind of creepy in a way but jackson manages to make that part believable and if he could make that it means he reached his goal with the film    naomi watts gives another terrific performance here it doesnt matter if she has to act against a giant ape she plays her character like she should be played the way she pets the gorilla is amazing using what she knows her dancing moves thats good stuff andy serkis is king kong and does a good job again at mimicking apes jack black doesnt do his usual act but he overdoes it and its a bit annoying adrien brody doesnt look like an action hero and its kind of awkward to see him fight those insects and all even if he does fairly good and gets away with it    king kong isnt the most profound film but it certainly does have something its awkward but its supposed to be it definitely works and the tone is just right in the end jackson stayed very faithful to the original film only adding meat to the bone and fleshing out characters he found the right note thanks to his lord of the rings fame he had the chance to make the film as he wanted it to be and that is a good thing he uses special effects like they should be used and makes a film that is thoughtful sometimes entertaining for a while and beautiful at the end lots of details not everyone enjoys it but i do its definitely better than the jeff bridges 1976 version a lot of fun    it was beauty that killed the beast
Dec 16 2009,positive,watched the original movieok lg
Dec 16 2009,positive,youll not expect a copy of the original but youll definitely be satisfied specially if you see the most memorable scene of the film as exact as it is from the previous one
Dec 16 2009,positive,it was a pretty good movie
Dec 16 2009,positive,was so much better than i thought it would i cried over a animated ape
Dec 16 2009,positive,nice i saw this one and after that i saw the version from the 30s the original wins p
Dec 16 2009,neutral,once again tooooo long
Dec 15 2009,negative,hahaha wot a load of shit not even worth half a star but it dnt let u put no stars on it it suck
Dec 15 2009,positive,i would first impression doesnt last king kong triggered all the emo shit outta me just like what green mile did different genre what can you ask for
Dec 15 2009,positive,i would first impression doesnt last king kong triggered all the emo shit outta me just like what green mile did different genre what can you ask for
Dec 15 2009,positive,king kong the greatest love story ever told    one of the things that i liked most about this movie is the character development all of the characters are deep and interesting most notably the star himself king kong this movie does an amazing job of giving this giant gorilla a heart this movie really makes you root for kong and feel sorry for him  the action in this movie is simply spectacular and hardly let up from kongs fight with trexs the chase through new york to the climax on top of the empire state building the action will get your heart pounding along with the action there are a few genuinely creepy parts mostly due to the giant bugs that make your skin crawl  the one complaint i could make about this movie is how it takes a while to get to the good parts but i dont notice that too much because this movie devotes that time to story and character development    all that being said this is a heartfelt movie with simply amazing action sequences and if you can get over the long run time of more than 3 hours than this movie will please most movie watchers
Dec 15 2009,neutral,great idea very stimulating visually but way way to long they could have gotten the same response but cuz out a few 45 minutes of this movie i would have liked it way more if it were shorter
Dec 15 2009,positive,two things that can always make movies more fun are dinosaurs and giant things that normally arent giant especially bugs this movie has both the action is very well done and so good its almost ridiculous   the three trexes scene was awesome i was skeptical at first i assumed theyd have kong fighting one and then throw him off camera as the other one shows up to just make it seem like he was fighting all three or that theyd just have a mess of chaotic wrestling and camera shaking but it was filmed perfectly we could always see at least two of the trexes on screen and when one wasnt shown theyd cut to him during the fight to show him trying to eat ann and the fight was always moving around and changing so it never got dull or repetitive but it didnt do it too much so it never felt add they took an awesome idea that would have been very unlikely that theyd do it well and made it perhaps better than i thought possible  jack black did a good job with his character but sometimes i felt like it was a bit too much he portrays the cruelness seen in people quite well i just think he might do it too often its almost hard to watch and i cant tell if its in a good way or not maybe its just because jack black is a strange casting choice the filmed dragged a few times but i wasnt too bothered by that neither was my eight year old sister i had fun the whole way through and i think this is a great movie
Dec 15 2009,negative,to long and boring
Dec 15 2009,positive,its good but watched long back
Dec 15 2009,negative,a one time watching movie
Dec 14 2009,negative,what a load of crap
Dec 14 2009,positive,going thru dvds and decided to watch this again  i must say it still takes my breath away  the humanity that peter jackson was able to put into this film was amazing  i can barely tolerate the capture scene tho just pisses me off  reminds me of the evil that money can bring and i have to shut if off once they start shooting him on the building  even as a child the 1976 version used to choke me up to where my throat and ears burned  all ape vs man movies get to me  beautifully done overall  cgi  all  applauds
Dec 14 2009,positive,great visual effects and moving action scenes this well done remake brings the legend back to life more vividly than ever
Dec 14 2009,positive,ok for some of the movies
Dec 14 2009,positive,one revision of legend again with little amount of style

Dec 11 2009,positive,exciting great cinematography
Dec 11 2009,neutral,one of the better remakes
Dec 11 2009,positive,you can tell when peter jackson really cares about a film because he pays attention to the utmost detail in this king kong remake whos length rivals that of the his other works the story comes to life through the details just as much as it does through overly sized primates jack black in a serious film was a worrisome topic before i had actually seen the film in hindsight this risk was certainly rewarded and the part of carl denham perfectly executed overall the film brings something new to the oversized primate table and a feast to those who couldnt get enough the first time
Dec 11 2009,neutral,silly monkey made me cry
Dec 11 2009,negative,hate the ending and basically the whole movie but i have seen it

Dec 8 2009,positive,thats the movie right here
Dec 8 2009,positive,oh great another king kong movie just what we needed after all those rubbish sequals to the 1933 classic we get yet another this what some of us were thinking when this film was announced but we were wrong this film is great  first off the acting is some of the best ive seen in any movie the story and how the characters act throughout it work out perfectly secondly the special effects are amazing better than some of today for some reason graphics seem to be degrading this year thirdly king kong is portrayed superbly it had character which was what it needed last off this film is exciting and i know exciting despite its ridiculous length it has some fun action scenes and this was one of the better films of 2005 i havent seen it in years though which is funny because i pretty much put it on dvd every day well its good to see king kong has made a good comeback if it wasnt for the inflated length and the large amount of time it takes to get to the good bits this would have got a higher score
Dec 8 2009,positive,from outstanding visual effects to an outstanding performance by naomi watts king kong provides you with a wondering quality of never before seen classic  while jack black is one of the few things that make this film not as good as the original 1933 perfect film this one is near perfect and it was great to see kong better than ever on the big screen again and id love to see the original on the big screen as well

Dec 1 2009,positive,peter jackson continues to recycle the sensation with this classic story actually this very entertaining film with a very solid story and visual effects are amazing but jackson seems to just focus on luxury and elegance of this film seen from the large budget of this film so that the elements of drama as in the original film is less explored by jackson thus many see only scattering expensive visual effects without touching drama

Nov 21 2009,positive,good special effects good movie
Nov 21 2009,positive,remakes usually arent this good  especially remakes of classic films  the original 1930s king kong is considered a classic  yet this peter jackson directed film gives the original a run for its movie money  even jack black gives a great performance and its nice to see him playing it straight and not over the top like he usually does  he even manages to nail his delivery of the classic line at the end of the film  it could have come across as lame yet black nailed it  the film even holds up to multiple viewings  i thought actor bruce campbell would have been a good addition to the cast of this film  kong rocks
Nov 21 2009,positive,kinda creepy but cool
Nov 21 2009,positive,oh this movie makes me cry
Nov 20 2009,positive,this movie was awesome
Nov 20 2009,positive,long beginging but gets real good into the movie
Nov 20 2009,positive,this movie was good too
Nov 20 2009,positive,with all of its tiny little flaws and minor pacing issues peter jacksons epic vision here is a true king among remakes it completely expands and glorifies all of the things that made the original so captivating being that peter jackson is a complete nerd for king kong trivia only helps all the inside jokes and homages are really fun to see played out where the original was all about being a fast paced monster movie this is about being an epicly constructed actionadventure movie and also an extremely well thought out period piece at the same time it still retains that element of the monster movie era but in the best way possible you have all the excitement and build up but no goofy effects and disappointments a lot of the credibility is due to the cast adrien brody and naomi watts are especially good and make the idea of a 50ft tall gorilla a realistic character while i dont necessarily believe that the pacing in the beginning works theres almost too much exposition the core story is so well developed that it doesnt matter especially from coming right off of lord of the rings peter jacksons remake is about as good as they come
Nov 20 2009,positive,i mean the original
Nov 20 2009,positive,omfg this is one of the best movies of like all time

Nov 16 2009,positive,to me king kong wasnt explained enough in the newly created hollywood style i beleive that when a movie is being remade they should just form some roots to the movie that we never quite understood from the older movies that is exactly what was lacked here i know the origins of king kong probably just as well as the next movie critic but for those who dont thats where the problem presents itself overall a very wonderful movie that has many entertaining moments

Nov 16 2009,neutral,im not going to lie and say this was excellent because it just wasnt i will say however that compared with the original it is astoundingly good peter jackson is one of the best directors in the world of film he almost manages to make you fall in love with a cgi gorilla now that is talent     several good actors and a bunch of welltimed heartfelt scenes make this film very beautiful to watch we also get to see a very different acting side to jack black which is always a good thing     i will also admit i did cry

Nov 13 2009,positive,the movie starts off pretty slow and i was considering turning it off but luckily i didnt because within the next 10 minutes i started seeing some of the most spectacular imagery i have seen in 2005 with a great plot and acting i would like to see the next director take on the challenge of remaking this remake if that makes any sense 
Nov 13 2009,positive,lolshe fell in love with a big ass monkey
Nov 13 2009,neutral,i didnt know that king kong died at the end but other then that it was ok
Nov 13 2009,positive,an emotionally powerful and adventurous epic movie every minute of its 3 hour run time is used to develop the characters and story or show off some incredibly life like special effects its hard to convince someone a 25 foot gorilla is standing in front of them but they did it really really well i cant really pick this one apart too much if i have any gripes its that the film doesnt really need to be over 3 hours the first act is too slow it drags on quite a bit and adrien brody as our male lead is okay but pretty forgettable overall a great movie and a rare excellent remake  910  excellent

Oct 28 2009,positive,the kong vs dinos scene is sure to please old wwf fans world wrestling federation not world wildlife foundation    why does a movie based on an hour and a half 1933 monster film clock in at over three hours why is jack black in it i dont have the answer to these questions but im happy with them i cant quite figure out why this film gets so much flak its really an intense vision that 99 of most hollywood blockbusters lack it has brilliant sets its performances are appropriate and jackson painstakingly develops a few unforgettable moments almost a kubrickian way the first half is intriguing the second half is pure excitement and its weaved together with some great filmmaking if it werent for the 1933s cultural significance and kitschy fun this would definitely be the best kong out there for those of you annoyed with the massive use of cgi would a giant ape suit make you feel better

Oct 19 2009,positive,ive allways loved the fat gaint ape kong and now we get a truly sensational remake of a classic film the story is about carl denham going to an uncharted island called skull island with a group of filmakers to make a movie including an actress ann darrow but the natives capture her and sacrifice her to their god kong so now the filmakers go into the jungle and try to rescue herthe story is a great recreation of the classic and timeless tale of beuty and beast some have complained that kong isnt in it for about an hour but i like this because this gives time to devolep the charecters and learn a bit of the plot it also creates great suspense because when they get to the island the film lets the audinces know kong is coming there is also some cool action with the natives when kong comes the action is fantastic like the fight with kong vs three vrexes the finale on top of the empire state building and theres even a recreation of a lost scene from the original the spider pit scene the effects are top notch and is also better then some stuff today the acting is fantastic this is the cast    cast  naomi watts as ann darrow a struggling vaudeville actress who is desperate to continue acting carl denham discovers her attempting to steal an apple from a fruit stand only to pay for it himself she is a big fan of jack driscoll but knows nothing about acting in a movie during the course of the voyage she falls in love with driscoll she also forms a special relationship with kong ann herself is very confident beautiful and capable of handling herself in a tough situation  jack black as carl denham a film director who obtained the map to skull island due to his desperate situation  involving debts and theft  carl is obsessive and slowly loses his moral compass during the film his producers are convinced that he is on a wild goose chase and the police have a warrant for his arrest  adrien brody as jack driscoll a scriptwriter who falls for ann he is on the voyage mistakenly when he delivers 15 pages of script to denham who consequently delays him as the ss venture begins its voyage jack is quickly enchanted by anns beauty and charm and plans to write a play for her he refuses to give up on anns rescue even continuing on alone even the crew turns back he is heavily involved with kongs return to manhattan  thomas kretschmann as captain englehorn the german captain of the ss venture who denham has hired to take the film crew to skull island  colin hanks as preston denhams neurotic but honest personal assistant  jamie bell as jimmy a boy who was found on the ss venture wild and abandoned he is a kleptomaniac and views hayes as a father figure  evan parke as ben hayes englehorns first mate and a friend of lumpy who leads anns rescue mission due to his army training and combat experience gained during world war i he is killed during the log scene after kong snatches him and subsequently throws him against the rock wall in the extended cut jimmy takes his hat in remembrance after the group is rescued from the insect pit  lobo chan as choy lumpys best friend and a janitor on the venture who falls to his death during the log scene  kyle chandler as bruce baxter an actor who specialises in adventure films such as tribal brides of the amazon rough trader and dame tamer he abandons anns rescue mission but brings englehorn to rescue them from the insect pit and is given credit for rescuing ann during the broadway display of kong he has sense once more to leave before kong escapes  andy serkis as kong motion capture and voice a 25ft gorilla who is around 120150 years old4 he is the last of his species megaprimatus kong   andy serkis as lumpy the ships cook barber and surgeon he is a brave sailor who goes to search for ann but is eaten alive in the pit after fighting a group of leechlike creatures  john sumner as herb denhams loyal camera man who has a fake right leg he is killed by a pack of venatosaurus after the apatosaurus stampede  craig hall as mike denhams soundman for the journey and ends up being the first person to be killed by the skull island natives when a spear impales him  jed brophy and todd rippon cameoed as crew members  overall this film couldnt be better and is great update of a timeless classic so id give it a 1010 and is one of the best films of all time

Oct 12 2009,positive,this film is not perfect but i cant resist giving it a perfect rating it is the best film of the year 2005 for me it is marked with stunning visuals and excellent performances this film can be divided into four parts on the basis of location the first 40 minutes takes place in new york this part whisks the audience back to 1930s 1930s is a time that has fascinated me the reason is the world was so different only seventy years ago but there were the modern pleasures like movies the next 20 minutes takes place in a ship this film features haunting visuals and is quite scary the next hour entirely takes place on an island most of the sequences were great on the island but sometimes the scenes tended to drag and they got annoying  the last hour is incredible in is easily the best part it is thoroughly entertaining and has great emotions in the end the film is great peter jackson epic but i wouldnt recommend it over the last 2 movies of lord of the rings it is near perfect

Sep 23 2009,positive,truly a wellwritten and welldone epic in its own right but no where near as memorable or innovative as the original
Sep 23 2009,positive,it was pretty cool but it kind of dragged in my opinion however it was exciting to watch
Sep 23 2009,neutral,its controversial
Sep 23 2009,positive,yep like this and onything wi anials
Sep 23 2009,positive,love it saw it last weekend on tv
Sep 23 2009,negative,how can you mend king kongs arm if hes twisted it with a monkey wrench  what is as big as king kong but doesnt weigh anything king kongs shadow      why didnt king kong go to hong kong he didnt like chinese food
Sep 23 2009,positive,a loving remake of a classic of special effects peter jackson  brings his usual visally dazzling flair to the fore resulting in a sweeping surprisingly poignant creature epic however the plot drags a bit over the course of the threehour run time a severe detriment at times
Sep 23 2009,positive,it was clear from the beginning that this 2005 remake was never going to have the same amount of praise or recognition of the 1933 original but peter jackson clearly put much effort into making this stand out as its own film the first hour or so is boring and slow and doesnt feature the great ape at all but the story quickly catches up when kong is introduced from there on king kong is action packed and is fairly entertaining this is not enough however to top the original and stand out as one of the best films in history rendering it mediocre
Sep 23 2009,positive,thats a hell kool movie
Sep 23 2009,positive,acting okay  cinematography was excellent
Sep 23 2009,positive,classic but everything are new to the eye
Sep 23 2009,negative,its just there theme of greed sipping well into the scenes
Sep 23 2009,negative,one of those terribly overrated movies partly because of its extreme length cut in two it might have earned an extra star on my rating although i just cant put my finger on what actually works well in this movie it seems like peter jackson was still high on lord of the rings and went beserk in the special effects laboratory just because he had the budget for doing it
Sep 23 2009,positive,maybe in the past not my kind of thrill today
Sep 22 2009,neutral,could of been alot better
Sep 22 2009,positive,despite what many critics say this is a powerful piece of cinema even though it is one of its most retold stories and one of its most classic stories while the original served its purpose in inspiring many greats like harryhausen lucas and jackson himself it is still somewhat outdated i like watching both mr jacksons interpretation and the original i wont bother with the 1976 version for apparently good reasonsthis film needs to be viewed seperately from its illustrious predecessor and taken as its own work the visuals are beautiful the acting terrific and the effects breath taking jackson gave skull island as much a history has he did to the locations in his lord of the rings trilogy and the man created an entire digital 1930s new york no easy feet i personally find this to be a beautiful and inspired work of art it might not be an original story nor does it add to our udnerstanding of human nature but it is the directors childhood dream come true which may be its mortal flaw which can be seen in the length but i feel the filmgoing public should be able to sit through more than 2 hours of movie a little dialogue never killed anyone jacksons dedication shines through and kong himself is worthy of recognition a more lifelike giant cgi ape you will never find andy serkis of gollum in lord of the rings brings this character to life in an unimaginable way referencing his work with real gorillas he gives kong that human look in those very realistic and soulful digital eyes all in all it is worth a watch or two and is worthy of far more credit than it has been given
Sep 22 2009,positive,graphics were pretty cool

Sep 21 2009,negative,boring  overused story
Sep 21 2009,positive,peter jackson is a genuis
Sep 21 2009,negative,dont like it that much
Sep 21 2009,positive,when youve got peter jackson the director of the outstanding lord of the rings trilogy as the man behind the film you know its going to be a highlydetailed movie of epic proportions after watching his vision of king kong that prediction is just an understatement the movie effectively portrays and gives justice to the bustling city of new york city during the roaring twenties and contrasts this metropolitan setting with the lush exotic world of skull island the special effects are worthy of watching on a giant hdtv with bluray and the acting of everyone nearly oscarworthy as for the giant gorilla himself king kongs appearance is magnificent  hes realisticlooking if you enjoy cgi as much as i do and hes fierce and intimidating i thoroughly enjoyed this film mainly because of its visuals but the acting and plot are fantastic as well its not a dumbed down summer adventure flick but its still a popcorn movie nonetheless the only downside with king kong is its 3 hour length which i think is outrageous other than that the movie is highly entertaining and really pays homage to the 1933 original
Sep 21 2009,positive,read the book toobook is way better
Sep 21 2009,positive,whack goralla flim was all good human acting
Sep 21 2009,positive,this to me is the greatest movie of all time i remember sitting there during the credits and just staring at the screen when i gathered enough guts to look over at my friend she too had tears streaming down her face  who on earth would have thought a movie about a giant ape would make me cry like i lost a pet not me    who else would have thought jack black could play a good serious role not me but he did surprise me tremendously and made me respect him just a little more but my hat ultimately goes off to naomi watts for playing a part which involved her being held by giant fake hands and acting next to an almost invisible character and portraying it so realisticly and emotionally job well done    only weak point in acting goes to adrien brody enough said    amazing movie amazing special effects amazing heart amazing characters amazing set pieces all directed by in my opinion the always amazing peter jackson
Sep 21 2009,negative,jack black shouldnt have been in this movie
Sep 21 2009,neutral,never understood what a big monkey sees in blondes

Sep 19 2009,positive,9310                 after finishing his breathetaking lord of the rings film trilogy peter jackson realized that he still had the rest of his entire career ahead of him and he intended to use whatever time he had left he has since the lotr films made but two films one of them great one bad and luckily for me and for you were talking about the better film which is king kong theres a name you may not or at least you should know it its the name that comes with a certain classic 30s creature feature which happens to be more than just that and its also the name attached to many spinoff films and sequels as well this was peter jacksons dream project and its the best way anyone could ever follow up an epic trilogy such as the lord of the rings      nobody makes films quite like jackson does he started out with horror movies and lowbudget satires such as braindead and bad taste and then went on to do stuff like forgotten silver and heavenly creatures he has done plenty in his career and once in a while he gets inspired to make something very epic large in spectacle such as this film here with king kong peter jackson has successfully avoided simply remaking the original film and instead he has reimagined it completely with more creatures more features and even more emotional resonance it could be seen as a fun adventure movie as well as a superb drama perhaps even both at the same time only a special kind of movie can accomplish so much but there you have it          i feel that one of jacksons greatest achievements with the film is recreating the great depression era thus creating a retro feel this works for the films benefit as i like anything genuinely retro that isnt just plain stupid like pearl harbor for example anyways onwards to the films main attraction the plot ann darrow naomi watts is a struggling new york theater actress who is being put out of work and forced to take desperate measures such as briefly considering burlesque dancing to make a buck she eventually runs into the equally as troubled filmmaker carl denham jack black in one of his best roles yet who gives her a shot at moneymaking guilt free     he invites her to be in his next film which is being written by famous playwright jack driscoll adrian brody and will be shot somewhere on a presumably undiscovered uncharted place called skull island the ship that will take the crew there sets sail undergoes problems and eventually lands itself accidentally on the island itself the place is one full of danger and you wouldnt have to even go on it to know that but the crew abandons ship after is crashes anyways and they eventually come in contact with the primitive tribes of the island who capture ann and sacrifice her to a beast that lives behind their walls in the jungles of the island and the beast is known as king kong      in an instant the heroine is snatched and taken deep into the jungles and the ships crew and the filmmakers set out to reclaim her so that they can finish the film along the way they discover that theres more than just a giant monkey kong hiding behind those walls the entire island appears to be crawling with prehistoric bugs fish and even dinosaurs themselves so there are two things on the minds of the crewmembers find the girl and survive as long as they possibly can against the prehistoric beings of skull island        what makes the film so good is the experience itself sometimes i go to a movie just to have some good fun to admire the craft that is required to create good entertainment i appreciate king kong because it does something much more than just entertain sure i cant deny that i was consistently interested by the visual techniques that were used to create kong and the rest of the creatures and creepy crawlies residing in his turf but i also found much more to be involved in too by the end i found the film to be quite moving and even emotionally resonant quite powerful really it is and thats a rare quality in hollywood cinema these days         scenes such as the one where the crew is chased by a group of disturbed brontosaurus and their disturbers the venatosaurus are enough to get your blood pumping there is a way that jackson channels the specialeffects used that makes the film truly thrilling he makes us feel as if we are there his shots are flawlessly thoughtout and the motioncapture that he used for king kong himself is fascinating the one in the suit which this kind of technology requires was jackson regular andy serkis who pretty much owns the role of kong and allows him some new dimension and depth the human actors present also give considerably praiseworth performances especially jack black who has never been so good throw in a talented colorful supporting cast and i believe we have a winner           i loved this film i love how it added and perhaps even improved on the original film without partially butchering it in the process i loved how it stuck to the rules of hollywood stylistics adventure action humor both likable and unlikable individual characters and how it also managed to go beyond some i loved a lot about king kong i think its a great movie one of the most entertaining of its kind and one of my personal favorite peter jackson films if only he could do movies like this one every day every year every moment but there is a reason why adventure films are getting scarcer and scarcer by the decade nobody has the guts and the skill that a man like jackson has along with spielberg and james cameron he is an ambitious gentleman but also a very unique and intelligent one not only does he know what his audience wants but he also knows how to deliver it as long as jackson doesnt leave his directorial comfort zone he can produce something rather visionary how else can you truly describe films like this and lord of the rings there are few others words
Sep 19 2009,positive,the original was better

Aug 26 2009,positive,intensely deserved  peter jacksons dream to remake his favorite film of all time was a blockbusting success  indeed jackson has a fire within him to create such amazingly detailed films surprisingly he started his career with no formal training    throwing traditional filming tactics out the window peter and his crew of spectacular actors including an outofleftfield performance by comedy king jack black really nailed the emotion within the soul of kong  to this day as i pass through bestbuy i still see the corporation showing clips of king kong on their blueray televisions proving that this eyecatching epic will wow future audiences to come

Aug 25 2009,positive,very good story movies
Aug 25 2009,positive,a really good movie to see there is a lot in it to keep someone entertained like for example the story is both dark and compelling and the best scenes are definetley those involving kong the fight against the trio of trex and the climax at the top of the empire state building really made this stand out from the previous versions of the film    however this isnt exactly what you call perfect some of the casting might be considered a little off and the excessive length of time of the film can get very exhausting  the whole story also gets a bit complex as the story goes on but by the end viewers should be able to understand what they spent the last few hours watching

Aug 23 2009,positive,and lo the beast looked upon the face of beauty and beauty stayed his hand and from that day forward he was as one dead  carl denham    an epic retelling of the classic story of king kong    in the 1930s carl denham is a struggling filmmaker trying to make his name in the world he has recently come into possession of a map that details the location of a long forgotten island simply called skull island he needs a leading lady in his film and one ann darrow catches his eye he convinces her to join him on his cruise to the mysterious place upon arriving the cast and crew discover that the local villagers are not friendly at all and they capture young ann darrow the men go out in search of the woman only to witness her being abducted by a massive 25 ft tall ape known as king kong while being held in captivity by the ape ann takes a liking to the creature where she finds compassion and humanity within the beast carl denham believes that if he can capture the beast and bring him back to america he would be rich beyond his wildest dreams denham convinces the boat captain to go along with his plan to head out into the dangerous jungle of skull island in hopes of finding ann and capturing the eighth wonder of the world king kong    at the age of twelve peter jackson wanted to recreate the 1933 film king kong but he ultimately gave up on it many years later jackson was contracted by universal to go ahead with his version of king kong due to the success of the lord of the rings trilogy at the time jackson was the best director on the planet jacksons skills as a director are clearly evident in this jaw dropping take on king kong one of the best films of 2005 and in cinema history after the release of the first king kong in 1933 the franchise was treated poorly with shitty sequels fights with godzilla and even a remake in 1976 king kong finally got the treatment he deserved because of peter jackson who has become one of the most acclaimed directors of all time ever since his lord of the rings trilogy this film received four academy award nominations for visual effects sound mixing sound editing and art direction winning all but the last it had a budget of 207 million the largest ever at the time and took in 550517357 at the box office    the woman of king kongs attraction is ann darrow naomi watts a struggling vaudeville actress who decides to join carl denhams jack black film only because she is a big fan of scriptwriter jack driscoll adrien brody watts delivers an excellent performance and turns the funny situation of kong and ann sitting in a tree into both touching and humorous moments i was expecting jack black to deliver more laughs than serious acting in his role but the guy certainly pulls off the character admirably adrien brody is an unbelievable action hero as he goes off into the jungle to bring ann back from the clutches of king kong the cast also features members from the uss venture the boat that gets everyone to and from the island the ship is under the control of a german captain englehorn and played excellently by the reliable thomas kretschmann other prominent ship members include jimmy jamie bell a boy who was found on the ship years ago and has come to view ben hayes evan parke a wwi veteran as a father figure there is also the ships cook lumpy played by anthony serkis who also did the motion capturing for king kong the acting by the supporting cast is excellent and even though some of the extra characters are unnecessary jimmy and ben hayes for example you do connect with these people who must fight for their survival on skull island    the star of this whole movie is the one and only king kong this version of kong is one of the best beasts ever done in cinema easily outdoing godzilla cloverfield and any other behemoth you can think of the creature itself is 25ft tall is 120150 years old and is the last of his species megaprimatus kong this gorilla can take on pretty much any beast roaming the island three trexs try to devour kongs girlfriend but he shows them who is the king of the island the only thing that calms down this fearless and courageous ape is ann kong takes a liking to her and realizes she is not the enemy and only wants to be her friend he ultimately tries to protect her from her own species in new york in one the films most action packed and touching scenes the cgi done on kong is astounding and you can almost see each individual hair on his body naomi watts has better chemistry with this cgi creature than adrien brody and on some level this relationship will affect any sort of movie viewer    the creatures on skull island rival the dinosaurs from jurassic park there are giant lizards brachiosaurus triceratops giant bats man eating slugs cockroaches and an assortment of enough giant bugs to make your skin crawl every time you think of them the cgi work done on these creatures is excellent but there is the odd blemish on the creature models that some people may notice the cinematography of the jungles on skull island is very pleasing to the eyes as well as an extravagant 1930s new york city the music is composed by james newton howard and it is like a cats meow it really catches the story that is both otherworldly and sad    this film is a great piece of cinema but it isnt perfect one of my small and few complaints is that the film suffers from bad pacing especially in the first hour the action certainly picks up once kong is unleashed and some of the best scenes in film are delivered with this creature for some this film may be too long but it did not bother me one bit since good filmmaking can never be too long despite the 3 hour running time i still wished the characters lives would still be expressed on screen indefinitely    king kong should definitely be checked out by all movie watchers whether they want heart stopping special effects or a love story of beauty and the beast    it wasnt the airplanes it was beauty killed the beast  carl denham
Aug 23 2009,positive,nice movie with good actors
Aug 23 2009,positive,technically excellent but maybe lacking some of the charm of the original

Aug 22 2009,negative,the original was better
Aug 22 2009,positive,great remake with stunning visual effects not much to the story as usal
Aug 22 2009,positive,i know it must have been tough to remake a masterpiece most remakes arent very good at all but i really like peter jacksons king kong is it better than the original no but that doesnt mean its a bad movie its actually a very good remake one of the movies problems is that its a bit too long but that didnt really bother me what i dont like about this film is the first hour there were a couple of flaws in the first hour that make the movie a bit boring but once kong gets in the picture its non stop entertainment peter jackson made a lot of chances in his version his movie benefited from some of the chances but some of the chances really slowed the movie down at times i really like how in this version we get more back story from the main characters but i dont like how over exaggerated a lot of the things are in this version it makes it a bit harder to buy in to the premise overall i think this film is a solid 7810 and i doubt anyone is ever going to be able to do a better job at remaking king kong peter jackson should be proud this is a very good film
Aug 22 2009,positive,damn  i was at the edge of my seat when i was watching this movie it is full of surprises and is a movie one can learn from

Aug 22 2009,negative,im more keen on the original film this remake didnt have that spark which made the original shine so much yes the upgraded cinematography was a lot better but it wasnt enough to save this film in my perspective the more serious approach from jack black sort of turned me away from this version as well i believe he was horribly miscast as was the actress of naomi watts the remake of king kong was an atrociously puttogether film and shouldnt have been defiled so
Aug 22 2009,positive,nice i licked naomi wats in this movie
Aug 22 2009,positive,a classic  it still gives me the willies to see him eating people and  running amok in manhattan  pretty daring for its time when he sniffs fay wrays you know what  love the movie for its campy overblown style of acting too

Aug 12 2009,positive,king kong started with a great foundation but with a director high on recent success behind the wheel and a studio willing to blindly fork over cash the movie ended up being just a giant limp guerrilla  this movie could have been so much better if peter jackson realized that not every movie he made after the lotr trilogy needed to be 3 hours long the film was bloated with story that no one cared about and actors that just didnt belong at times it was pure pj genius and other times it was the frightners at its worst lets hope peter jackson hops in the directors chair of something he loves and understands now that the hobbit trilogy unfortunately lost guillermo del toro

Aug 7 2009,negative,no i dont care i hate remakes of classics
Aug 7 2009,positive,i didnt expect to see this remake take off and shine like it did it was to my surprise worth taking 188 minutes to watch it didnt seem so long thanks to the wellrounded characters and special effects andy serkis is the highlight taking on  not only the role of kong himself but of lumpy the cook perhaps the most colourful character shown onscreen the biggest shocker was jack blacks honest somewhat heart warming and charming role of carl denham i was unaware that he was able to be anything other than funny or stupid if not funny i do think however that it couldve gotten to kongs entrance quicker
Aug 7 2009,positive,after the great commercial success both critical and box office with the lord of the rings peter jackson embarked on an ambitious project in this case the remake of king kong jackson had it hard and to do another version of a legendary film is very complicated the end result was regular as entertaining visual effects was impressive the problem was in the script it became repetitive and corny at times also gets too long the creator of lord of the rings you should ask for more

Aug 3 2009,positive,i never would have thought that jack black would be a good actor in a serious movie but i have been proven wrong jack black played a big part in the movie king kong even though this movie was 3 hours long every last minute was amazing
Aug 3 2009,positive,special effects amazing youll like this classic
Aug 3 2009,positive,after the amazing success of the lord of the rings series peter jackson has finally time to turn to his dream job king kong is obviously a project he really likes but he has said many times that the 1933 version of king kong is one of his favorite movies and you can see on the movie that he cares because he takes very good care of the material its no question that the director himself and the amazing visual effect company weta are a stamp of  quality you also cant complain about the amazing visual ride this movie takes you on but this is also one of the most expensive movies that have been made but obviously not close to avatar    even without the visuals this movie has its heart in the right place and that tells us everything about how the director cares for this story the acting is better then i expected especially from jack black but he does a brilliant job playing the dirt bag carl durnham adrien brody is also great but his character jack driscoll isnt really that interesting only reason i liked the character was because of adrien but the change from being coward to the hero was a bit unrealistic jamie bell colin hanks thomas kretschmann and kyle chandler are there just to fill in the cast and do it well like expected still it was strange how everyone just disappeared in the last third of the movie especially bell his character got a little focus in the beginning and you expected the movie to follow up on him but it never did    the direction is both right on the money and ambitious even though the acting didnt take the lead in this production but that is to be expected when you are making a whole new world out of nothing the computer work is wonderful and not a flaw to find in there did you see the big monkey amazing every small details are perfectly done and make that character 100 believable and you have too praise andy serkis for a fantastic job in the motioncapture department but it was his movements that were eventually made the monkeys movements    i have too say that i think peter jackson has made here not only one of the most entertaining monster movie that has been made in a while it also tells us that remakes arent always a bad thing maybe the movie is a bit too long and i am starting to think peter jackson has lost all  sense of time while he was shooting the lord of the rings series its not like the movie has a low point its just that some of the action scenes could have been a little shorter and that would have shaved of 20 minutes    peter jackson is one of the most fresh and talented directors out there and deserves to be on the same boat as steven spielberg stanley kubrick martin scoresesewell you see where i am going with this if you havent seen it go check it out because this is a brilliant piece of cinema that you wont be disappointed with    810
Aug 3 2009,negative,way too gory for my taste
Aug 3 2009,positive,revisited this recently only seen it once before and again the 3 hour investment us wholly justified thanks to peter jacksons lavish and often indulgent trip to skull island and back forgot the cg primate for a second the casts performance is impeccable noteworthy mentions to jack black for taking a more serious dramatic role and naomi watts for carrying the film and enduring months of green screen fake kong action

Aug 2 2009,neutral,jackson thinks he can turn an old monster movie into a great action cgi thrillerdespite all the giant bugs and dinosaurs i still think this movie is another screw up remake and i cant get through the whole movie without falling asleep

Aug 1 2009,positive,omggg thee longest effing movie ever
Aug 1 2009,positive,it touches anybodys  heart
Aug 1 2009,positive,8810    while theres no doubt the film runs long 3 hours and 15 minutes its an enjoyable 3 hours and 15 minutes finally the 1933 film is remade in a respectable manner who better to do that than peter jackson the master of big american cinema very big in this case while it cant be a classic due to that its a remake it does the real classic justice the special affects are outstanding not only that but this film packs a lot of emotion in it when watching it you feel horrified at one point and then saddened the next it can keep you on the edge of your seat even though you essentially know what happens great film from jackson

Jul 30 2009,positive,theres a lot that can be said about this particular remake of the originalits the best one to date i think jack black overplayed his roll as the filmmaker carl denham just a bit but still did a good job overall there were three scenes that i absolutely loved when naomi watts as ann darrow danced for kong and he kept knocking her down because he thought it was funnyit was the next scene was when they her and kong sat together enjoying the sunset and then the scene when he protected her from the other predators all in all well filmed well acted great cinematography recommend it to all who are kong fans

Jul 20 2009,positive,beautifull feeling film which ever i saw before
Jul 20 2009,neutral,the only way i can bear to watch is by thinking its a highbudget bmovie i mean they pretty much announce that it is one jack blacks character saysmonsters are for bmovies but even with that i still can have trouble enjoying this movie theres just flaws all over the place and i cant help but see things that resemble other even better movies like jack blacks character is reminiscent to johnny depps portrayal of ed wood the movie is just reminding me of movies that are far superior to itself overall to me its a movie that is just showing off cg it looks more like a game than a movie

Jul 17 2009,positive,ok if you are bored with noyhing to do
Jul 17 2009,positive,i know a lot of people including my auntie ellen are probably going to kick me in the face for saying this but i think king kong is a much stronger showing than any of the lord of the rings movies by peter jackson naomi watts is gold and has a lot of chemistry with nothing im pretty sure she acted with a green screen when entertaining the giant ape the visuals are top notch and at some point you start to care even just a little bit for the ape this movie is beautiful and surprisingly moving and manages what the lord of the rings and many others have failed to do make me care about the characters this is what movie magic is all about
Jul 17 2009,positive,like the original 1933 classic this remake of king kong is a visual marvel from beginning to end thats no surprise coming from director peter jackson not only is it a thrilling adventurous ride right to the credits but its also tremendously moving the cast is fantastic especially naomi watts this is a monster movie of the highest order even if it does run for three hours its always exciting
Jul 17 2009,neutral,the national geographic film that would never end king kong has great visuals an ok cast but lacked that ever important aspect fun also the running time was just too long and hurt it even more for me overall we did buy it on dvd when it first came out thinking it would be a safe noview purchase we hadnt seen it yet but much like planet of the apes it just didnt deliver
Jul 17 2009,positive,this is a good picture

Jul 16 2009,positive,great special effects
Jul 16 2009,neutral,although this is a nice actionadventure movie i just cant get over how much i hate naomi watts performance i just dont like her i loved jack black  adrien brody but watts performance just ugh but other than that it was decent a lot of creepy scenes that really caught your attention like all the crazy people in the beginning and the huge creepy bugs i just thought the movie was a tad too long  dragged out

Jul 13 2009,neutral,although this is a nice actionadventure movie i just cant get over how much i hate naomi watts performance i just dont like her  i loved jack black  adrien brody but watts performance just ugh  but other than that it was decent  a lot of creepy scenes that really caught your attention like all the crazy people in the beginning and the huge creepy bugs  i just thought the movie was a tad too long  dragged out

Jul 13 2009,positive,one scene dat really made my eyes grow bigger was the battle between kinkong and the trexs
Jul 13 2009,positive,peter jackson does it again king kong is a very fullon but also heartfelt drama that succeeds in many ways in the hands of jackson the visuals are not surprisingly superlative both on the brutal and beautiful skull island and in 1933 new york city the heart of the film is the relationship between king kong and ann played by naomi watts there is wonderful chemistry between the beast and the beauty that continues to develop until the last fateful scene the effects that bring kong to life are astounding each facial expression captured perfectly to give the creature emotion and personality this is what makes the film so impressive     the film does not go without its faults though much of the middle part of the film involves ann and other characters screaming and running away from large monsters or large monsters battling eachother however naomi watts is very appealing even when in situations that look dire and the creatures are unbelievably realistic to make the battle sequences every bit worth it there are also repetitive moments consisting of people being saved from an ill fate at the last minute by some dangerous force this happens more than four times and although occasionally exciting starts to feel tired after the fourth time     nevertheless the slow start and lengthy action sequences are made up for by a spectacular climax at the end that is both tragic and beautiful all actors give fine performances and the film is well scripted but it is the production team and director peter jackson who have made a truly special film it is very but it is also highly entertaining visually magnificent and emotionally resolute
Jul 13 2009,positive,excellent moviecan watch it over and over

Jul 8 2009,positive,great entertainment with a bit of heart a humor great cgi and my first real connection to a giant monkey sad sad ending
Jul 8 2009,positive,an affectionate remake  jackson staying true to the original but adding his own unique touch  performance wise black suprises taking time out from his obnoxious fat guy routine to give a performance actually worth watching he gives the character of the money hungry amatuer film maker more depth than it has in previous remakes    watts is also rather impressive finally leaving ledgers fame behind and claiming her own this film to her was the big break she deserved giving a long overdue oportunity to show off her acting skill which it appears she does have    actors aside though jamie bell does deserve a mention the cgi is very effective remaining both state of the art yet looking considerable tacky and stuck on which is the intended effect it is a testament to the original  the film is laden with them such as the trex scene which is in memory of the director of the original an impressive scen but not entirely acturate as trexs are thought to have been solitary creatures    but what nakes the film special is the title character himself for this time around kong is an actual character and not just there to provide a thrilling climax he has emotions and manerisms not shown before and more importantly an age he is shown as being quite old and therefore experiencedhe is hardened from a lonely existence and for reasons unknown bereaved its almost like he has lost a loved one which is a possibitly as a large ape like skull can be seen in one sceen on the island  kong can be summed up by one word sorrow king of an empty kingdome  alone and isolated its things like this which allows the audience to see him not as a beast but as a person    with a slightly drawn out plotline and a sometimes overdramatic lead  kong is simply a winter blockbuster described by most as  a monster of a movie it can be looked at fondly by many but doesnt require a second viewing

Jul 6 2009,positive,friendship is the best thing that can ever happen to 2 different persons i love this film too
Jul 6 2009,positive,oh what to make of this new kong remake in some ways i think we should think ourselves lucky the film is as good as it is it at least serves as a serviceable tribute to the original classic unlike the absurd 70s de larentis project it still lacks anything truly remarkable about it jackson seems to have tried to essentially remake the original film except taking account modern sensibilities by making the whole thing bigger and more sophisticated but in the end its simply far too long the sheer length creates more opportunities for problems and there are plenty of them from boring action scenes and drama that irritates rather then inspires questionable casting choices including the completely offkey jack black dont help    its odd because its doesnt really seem like a bad movie in total i liked different portrayal of the ape and this new much more dispensable denham had serious potential although it wasnt handled perfectly the atmosphere of the film ranging from depressionera new york to boat and the different areas of the island were superbly done and benefited enormously from the special effects    its highly thought of by the critics but i think its overrated a long ponderous epic think cleopatra but with a giant ape
Jul 6 2009,negative,bah  boring  unoriginaltoo bad pj has his name stamped to this dog doo
Jul 6 2009,positive,king kong is the name of a fictional giant gorilla from the fictional skull island who has appeared in several works since 1933

Jul 5 2009,positive,i thoght it was a good improvement on the first atteempt and i would give it a three out of five star rateing
Jul 5 2009,positive,sometimes during my lifetime i have to stop being a snob and admit that everytime this movie shows on tv i cant help but watch it its just freakin rewatchable  yeaah its heavily flawed the whole skull island sequence is overlong but it think they pay it up with the whole new york scene and i also love that jackson pays detail and homage to the original movie just for example putting the pepsodent and chevrolet ads in 1933s times square just like in the original one and naomi watts performance here is the second best of her after mulholland drive if only some scenes were cut this might get a perfect score from me more than original

Jul 4 2009,positive,i was thrilled to my bone
Jul 4 2009,positive,great effects great storyline romance
Jul 4 2009,positive,ok i finally got to see this film and to be frank i was pretty impressed sure the visuals have dated a bit but really this is a pretty good remake of king kong i mean  a remake that actually outdoes its predecessor sure theres none of the heartwarmingly cheesy feel that the original merian c cooper film had but this film proves to be different itself a promise to make us truly cry for the ape not just out of pity for its relative patheticness as an animal in a foreign land but for how deep animals can get peter jacksons take on the classic tale becomes a classic in of itself    then again its not as innovative while the effects in the original are insanely dated they were still pretty impressive for their time however this film takes the easy way out and practically uses 75 cgi even in new york since when did peter jackson decide to tag along with weta digital and create entire landscapes theres a big difference between nyc and pandora you know then again thats a stupid comparison  pandora belongs to a derivative film that feels like a masterpiece because of its message and because of the intimacy of everything in cgi nyc its actually kind of nice then again if this were heavenly creaturesera jackson nyc would either be shot on location or done as a model or populated with puppet things    however i did adore jack blacks turn as the wonderfully crazy carl denham creating the character from somebody trying to earn a buck to one of the most opportunistic movie characters since joe gillis and haven hamilton he should take on more roles like that and not just stick to his typical shtick of look at me im a funny fat man who has the power of rock    so yeah i think ive found the better of the two films it may seem controversial but its my opinion take it or leave it
Jul 4 2009,neutral,ok but not my cup of tea
Jul 4 2009,negative,weird how come to have a very huge monkey which is a gorilla

Jun 25 2009,neutral,saw it once its wa ok
Jun 25 2009,positive,king kong is an exuberant entertainment  and thats only the es  to simply call it a remake is an injustice  in fact watching this i realize how useful this movie is that peter jackson has made  the movie runs a little over 3 hours but like all the great epics generally flies by  the visuals are so wonderfully encapsulating that time is our last concern  im going to the simple degree just to say that new york the times square area itself is so greatlooking  it is set with the backdrop of the depression looking snowy and flashy  its superblooking as well as just being so bloody entertaining  it stands on its own feet and there is no reason to compare it to the 1933 original  the special effects are so uptodate that this is the best rendition of kong the gorilla i have seen  hes not as jerky now hes full in flesh naturalflowing  and jackson follows the same rule as spielberg did in jaws  he does not show the monster until an hour or a little after into the film  another pleasure of the film is seeing the whole early moviemaking process  the story is in a broad sense the same  a troubling director carl denham jack black enlists his cast and crew to get away from the new york scene and film his shoot on the mysterious skull island  another large piece of the heart is the chemistry behind the gorilla and the heroine ann darrow naomi watts  they way they communicate and interact is beautiful  there is no creepy aura and their relationship is a parable for things that may have not been acceptable socially in the 30s or probably still now  theres a lot to appreciate about king kong  this is virtuouso filmmaking
Jun 25 2009,negative,is this a kind of movie or sme thing else  lol

Jun 23 2009,positive,why did the poor monkey have to die
Jun 23 2009,positive,i saw most versions  including the 2005 remake of king kong
Jun 23 2009,positive,first of all it looks great the cinematography is going to get nominated for sure the first 45 minutes to an hour is all character developement i felt it moved at a steady paced and was interested in each of the characters jack black was a nice choice to play underhanded movie producerdirector carl denholm he plays him with just enough deviance that we do not see him as a villain naomi watts plays ann darrow pretty well for the most part but in a couple of scenes seems to look at kong as a lover instead of a protector friend adriane brody on the other hand does a very good job playing an everyman character so well as a matter of fact i dont remember anything about his character now to the meat and potatoes skull island the first 45 minutes may have been all characterization but the next hour or so makes up for it in spades when they arrive  or crash as the case may be on skull island it does not stop one thing after another from dinos to bugs attack them the natives can be pretty scaryas a matter of fact most of everything on the island is the only flaw in the graphics comes during a scene on the island there is a brontosaurus stampede and jackson uses some of the worst rear screen since superman 4 not to mention rendering the humans with cgi no cgi human has ever looked realistic on screen not to worry though there is plenty of cool stuff on the island and as i said when it starts it does not let up while there are some problems with the dino cgi kong looks flawless to the point where after awhile youll ask yourself where they found a monkey that big and how the hell did they train him i didnt really feel any of the 3 hours and 8 minutes until the end when my bladder was so full it burned over all it is a good solid movie with a few flaws i cant think of a scene id cut but maybe a couple id trim a
Jun 23 2009,positive,because of director peter jackson
Jun 23 2009,positive,this is touching too
Jun 23 2009,negative,the original was better

Jun 22 2009,positive,never seen any of the originals but i dont care all i know is that i liked king kong great special effects and acting   it does drag a fair bit in the beginning but once it kicks off king kong is an action packed adventure  bit of yucky scenes in there like those weird worm things and the funny tribal people doesnt bother me but it might make some squeamsih  really cool not as epic as peter jackson might have liked it to be but still a worthy adventure

Jun 14 2009,negative,nice humananimal relationship plot
Jun 14 2009,positive,the original is a terrific film that holds up better than i could have possibly expected seeing it a mere hours before the new film jacksons version already had a strike going against it i knew of the three hourplus running time beforehand so i was more than a little curious to see exactly how and why jackson had chosen to expand the film so much could he justify an epiclength monster movie the answer is a resounding no the first 20 minutes of the new king kong are abysmal opening with an allegedly amusing montage of depressionera new york and intercutting scenes of vaudeville the intro almost makes you think a musical is ahead its total cheese from there we get a superfluous back story on the character of anne darrow who desperately wants to just make people laugh on the vaudeville stages but the theater where she performs is shut down she even talks to a kindly old man who gives her some words of wisdom none of this matters one bit in the final context of the story to come the character of carl denham has also been fleshed out this time performed with flair by a painfully miscast jack black    enough about the opening though i cant say much more about it because honestly it was putting me to sleep finally lo and behold we get to the boat this is where we are introduced to the jack driscoll character unlike the original driscoll is now a writer but like the original darrow has a thing for driscoll the boat ride was relatively brief in the original film but the new kong spends a significant time period on the ship much like lord of the rings jackson introduces us to a slew of characters and tries his best to balance them out unlike lotr most of these extra characters arent needed you dont really care that much about what happens to them especially when the alternative is spending time with the spectacular kong who is still not on screen 45 minutes into the movie finally we get to the island where the pacing starts to pick up     the key element is the relationship between kong and ann which jackson nails kongs story is a sad one and you feel for kong by the end of the movie but so much of the story doesnt need to be there adrien brody is a fine actor and there is nothing at all wrong with his performance as driscoll its just that his character doesnt need to be this big a part jackson seems to be aiming for some sort of a love triangle but its never realized brody and watts never really click and this relationship only distracts from the central story of kong and ann     king kong is worth seeing especially on the big screen quite simply jackson tries to do too much and goes off in too many directions he goes in with the same instincts that served him so well in lord of the rings but fails to realize that this isnt an epic storyline its still a monster movie no matter how much he makes us care for kong there doesnt need to be a dozen characters we dont need to know every bit of back story for every character we want kong technically jackson raises the bar once again the action and visuals are stunning everything looks great and when we finally get to the action jackson completely delivers all in all king kong 2005 is a pretty decent film but it could have been a very good film shave off a good 45 minutes and recast the carl denham part and jackson may have even achieved greatness
Jun 14 2009,neutral,this is the best king kong
Jun 14 2009,negative,too long get bored halfway
Jun 14 2009,positive,some people say that older versions were better but i loved this one the most
Jun 13 2009,positive,you know the movie is too long when the action becomes boring at points the cg kong obviously has better acting skills than his 1933 counterpart but other than that jackson really just makes a longer version of a film that already existed
Jun 13 2009,positive,it a action not that much it made me cry when king kong fell off the tower
Jun 13 2009,positive,i lives up to all the hype this is one hugely entertaining film naomi watts is great and the rest of the cast is fine as well the special effects are some of the best i have ever seen it hardly seemed three hours plus because the film was immensely engrossing peter jackson did a great job the sets sound and editing are all first rate the period detail of 1933 is fantastic this is brilliant film making and has everything a great movie should have

Jun 6 2009,positive,peter jackson knows how to make an epic movie experience that an audience will never forget coming off his huge success with the lord of the rings trilogy jackson is back this time remaking a classic now we are all skeptical about remakes these days but this movie was beyond phenomenal while the original is a classic this is easily just as good if not better then the original looking at the cast i was worried about how jack black would work in a serious role while his comedic side is definitely there he definitely blew me away he proved all the naysayers wrong and filled out his role perfectly adrian brody great as usual as well as the supporting cast but naomi watts and kong himself stole the show i had not watched this movie in about a year but seeing this movie again on blu ray was definitely breath taking the visuals the cinematography the score all these things added up for one hell of a ride this movie is 3 hours long but it doesnt feel that way at all i love it just as much now as i did back in 2005 this is easily one of my favorite movies of all time an odd choice for sure but in my eyes it was damn near perfect perfect cast breath taking visuals stellar action sequences and a beautiful score by james newton howard i would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a fantastic film and be apart of a true movie experience for my overall rating i give king kong a perfect 1010

May 26 2009,negative,lets be honest here if youre going to remake a classic film you need to do something different and not just add new special effects you have to change the story but not to the point where it upsets the purists here the purists will be happy in some respects and everyone else including myself will get bored out of their skulls were in an age where a film shouldnt be longer then a couple of hours unless its a phenomenon this isnt on top of that the acting is pretty stale im not saying that they havent tried but theres only so much you can do the ending scene is best bit of the film not just because of naomi watts but because its the end of the film and you can wake up
