Jun 16 2021,positive,its actually a little bit more soulful than it lets on
Apr 29 2021,negative, in the genre of teenagers saving the world in postapocalyptic wastelands mortal engines is a very odd entry its conceit taken from a successful youngadult novel series from the early 2000s makes very little sense after the world was destroyed in a brief brutal nuclear war society has rebuilt itselfon wheels entire cities have been lifted somehow on to massive chassis and hurtle around the scrubby land looking for stuff how not even a suggestion of an explanation why its never really clear beyond it being a good excuse for some whizzy cg and the cg in this film is very whizzy weta digital have done a fantastic job making this odd world look real you will believe a teeming metropolis can chase a bavarian village across the desert visually its often wondrous behind the visuals though the machinery is awfully creaky the lord of the rings team of fran walsh philippa boyens and peter jackson wrote the adaptation lord of the rings showed they are brilliant at wrangling rambling story and massive worlds into understandable narrative that skill has deserted them here every plot turn in mortal engines raises more questions and provides very few answers its core character is hester hera hilmar a loner assassin fixated on killing thaddeus valentine hugo weaving who was responsible for the death of her mother valentine is a very powerful and wellrespected man in london the largest and apparently most vindictive of the wheeled cities whose inhabitants dont know hes building something sinister in st pauls cathedral when hester tries to kill valentine shes stopped by tom robert sheehan a young man who archives old relics like toasters and televisions the pair wind up stranded in the wilderness forging an unlikely alliance as they try to get back to london for very different reasons while its at heart a simple revenge story the mechanics are often deeply confusing and drearily humorous only sheehan raises any kind of adventurous energy valentine does all his scheming in secret so people wont realise hes evil but the residents of london are shown to be so bloodthirsty shouting and cheering whenever they destroy a smaller city and not remotely objecting when he reveals his grand plan that he may as well have been above board the whole time hesters backstory is baffling involving a mother who was were told vital to those resisting the wheeled cities but also in a relationship with valentine neither of which is clearly explained theres a zombie assassin that relentlessly tracks hester killing hundreds becausehe likes her the plot is a distant secondary consideration to action setpieces there are so many gaps in the storytelling and so much reliance on chance and characters guessing things that its never even remotely absorbing or satisfying its a beautifully designed world but no real life exists within it
Jan 29 2021,negative, if a bad film is lucky it will manage a handful of mediocre reviews a decent return at the box office and a steadfast retirement into netflixs catalog the problem mortal engines will face is not that it is bad per se its simply not very good and the parts that arent terrible are because you are hopefully seeing it in imax if not on a regular theater screen and the visuals are enough to keep you mildly entertained cowritten and produced by peter jackson of lord of the rings fame mortal engines is a lifeless fantasy epic that is mildly enjoyable at times but suffers from several grave afflictions that ultimately incur steep viewing consequences based on the 2001 series by philip reeve the film is a sweeping steampunk look at our postapocalyptic world after a sixty minute war ravages the earth forcing the major cities to find a set of wheels  yes cities become monster trucktype monstrosities  and scour the wastelands for resources undergoing what is coined municipal darwinism london is the principal traction city dominating and ultimately devouring smaller traction cities in order to utilize their resources following a highthrills chase sequence that opens the film london is undergoing one such feast when a local historian tom natsworthy robert sheehan meets thaddeus valentine hugo weaving a local celebrity who was once a historian as well small talk is cut short by a mysterious woman named hester shaw hera hilmar who inexplicably attacks valentine and narrowly escapes by ejecting herself off the moving city despite his wellmeaning intentions tom pursues the shadowy girl and inadvertently lifts back the veil on a decadesold secret that makes him a liability and therefore disposable stranded in the harsh tundra tom and hester must work together to reach civilization and stop valentines maniacal plan before the earth is hit with another geocatastrophic event frequently oscillating in tone and aesthetic between jim henson minus the puppets and other extreme fantasy worldbuilding films like john carter and stardust mortal engines is certainly not hard to look at director christian rivers a former storyboard artist and visual effects teammate for most of peter jacksons biggest hits understands what we want to see and more importantly how to translate that onto the screen the colors pop the world around us swirls shot on detailed sets the beauty is surely in the details hundreds of perfectly dressed extras flock through several scenes largescale scenes including the aforementioned chase sequence the set of london is surprisingly charming and intimate and it gives us the sense that we really arent in kansas anymore not kansas in the 21st century at least the inventive machines of the future pique our interest but therein also lies one issue the film struggles to address the mechanics of the beastly cities are never fully explained or shown in enough detail it therefore doesnt seem plausible that cities could be made mobile the plot is immediately built on a shifty uncertain premise and we as the audience dont feel secure in the world we are entering world building in a fantasy film is essential to its success how can you allow yourself to dream if you know that youre asleep and the characters they cant seem to escape the caricature natures written into the script hester is a onenote manic altdisney princess who hides behind a scarf because of a measly scar on her face tom is a wideeyed ing√©nue with only good intentions and very little selfawareness he is also supposed to be the love interest but there isnt much chemistry flickering between the leads valentine is the fiendish villain with a sparkle of menace in his eye and an evil plot that actually maybe wasnt thought through all the way sure the sets are cool the story rolls hard and fast racing towards a final battle that you see coming from across the flatlands but in the end it feels like a long road trip to nowhere with people you dont particularly like
Jul 14 2020,negative,once we dive into the players and the events that have shaped them mortal engines is undeniably derivative of countless heros journeybased stories and hopelessly lacking in creative energy
Jul 13 2020,negative, dystopian ya novel adaptations seem to be a trend that will not go away the hunger games set a precedent that most fail to live up to and as each year passes the imagination disintegrates into dust the latest that falls into that category comes from the lord of the rings peter jackson and first time director christian rivers who produce a derivative paint by numbers affair with a transparent twist set approximately 3000 years from now the world has been scorched of cities as we know them in a 60minute war the mad max type landscape is roamed by cities on tractor like bases some are tiny and insignificant whiles others are tremendously large bellowing and boisterous monstrosities that swallow the smaller ones whole for fuel and ancient parts  london is one in particular with landmarks such as st pauls cathedral dome and trafalgar square lions scattered around its compound this is the big daddy of cities and no one in their right mind would come against it the well respected thaddeus valentine hugo weaving is at the helm of this city on the surface he appears to be an honourable man but as hester shaw hera hilmar boards the city and subsequently attacks him its obvious he isnt as snow white as he would like to portray no sooner is hester on board she quickly gets kicked off with museum apprentice tom robert sheehan and we are soon on a quest to get back to london so hester can finish the job before weapons of the past can be rebuilt to destroy the world as they know it the major problem here is the fact we have all seen this before there is nothing original or imaginative to set this out and in parts can be seen as a homage to the likes of star wars throw in hesters backstory and a resistance group lead by anna fang jihae and we have that ageold dystopian battle to save the world and save the oppressed the beat of the plot steam punks its way to its predictable ending which youll easily call from the very first scene with visually exciting tenacity the attention to detail to the dark and grimy depths of the core of londons inner sanctum are beyond doubt an impressive feat but at times it confuses itself does it want to be serious or funny neither hit with any real connection the jokes fall flat and even the funniest moment when the minions are referred to as american deities raises a few titters isnt quite factually correct the performances are bog standard hilmar gives as good as she gets as an asskicking and determined heroine but sheehan doesnt really have much to work with thrown in as a sidekick that could be a love interest he really doesnt have much to do but follow hilmars hester around like an annoying little puppy these engines have had a false start and broken the fan belt thank god they are mortal because this one dies a very slow death
May 20 2020,negative,a missed opportunity
May 20 2020,negative,it wasnt fun or good or interesting
Apr 4 2020,negative, about ten minutes into mortal engines i became convinced i would never find out what a mortal engine actually is is it the giant behemoth city that is london on wheels or maybe its the centipede like vehicle that rambles across the wasteland with ease or could it be the steampunk planes that defy gravity or possibly its robot dad who has green eyes that pierce through the night if theres one thing for sure there wont be a second mortal engines film to give an explanation maybe thats what a mortal engine is the behemoth that is hollywood endlessly creating bloated cgifilled flicks that cost more than a small country makes in a year all the while theyre destined to fail at the box office eventually once the template of the producers has failed one too many times these mammoth production houses have no choice but to dissolve into nothing leaving a field of producers standing alone scratching their heads with no idea how this ever could have happened  sure this film does contain the best post credits scene of all time as in the film simply cuts to a black screen oh that wasnt a post credits scene and instead was just the sweet mercy grip that this whole thing was finally over well then but even though there are apparently three more books in the seriesthere is simply no way that there will ever be a continuation of this series apparently the books are popular young adult fare which given the content i can easily believe that  now damning this film with the faintest of praise for a brief moment i will say that mortal engines is one of those eighties films like the goonies that you fell in love with as a kid and then you rewatch it as an adult and realise it was all bunkum trash its a childish kind of good but i fear that kids nowadays are a little bit wiser than we were in the eighties and wouldnt stand for such mediocre material well even though conan obrien once said dont be cynical its bloody well hard not to approach this tepid affair with a heavy dose of cynicism theres so little to hold onto with this film  plot oh yeah you probably want to know about the plotwell theres a girl with a scarf over her face because shes got a scar fear not bfi shes the hero of the piece so yknow positive representation and all that her name is hester shaw hera hilmar if you forget this the film will remind you every thirty seconds as supporting characters are endlessly shouting out her name hester shaw even though as a main character shes surprisingly devoid of any kind of agency  instead the guy driving the plot is han solo mark 9 this time played by robert sheehan sheehan has been in films before i know this because i quite liked him in three summers but his casting here feels like it happened simply because he was in a film called the mortal instruments city of bones good on you rob alas theres little to suggest that hes going to go on to do bigger brighter better things in this flick  hugo weaving appears because new zealand isnt very far from australia and peter jackson has his phone number on speed dial hes hugo weaving the biggest crime of weavings casting is that the film never allows him to chew on the dialogue it throws at him heck when weavings villain calls someone a dinosaur and then remarks that hes the meteor the film presents this solid line with all the impact of a wet paper towel soppy and annoying  then theres stephen lang as cgi robot dad shrike hes a robot and hes hester shaws surrogate dad for reasons he is real mad at her and now stalks the world searching for her the character design is admittedly quite impressive but its impossible to shake the feeling that shrike walked out of a pirates of the caribbean film into this one by mistake no doubt the character has some kind of emotional resonance in the books but here its just another subplot that makes no sense and goes nowhere which is the best way to explain mortal engines its nonsensical pap that would have been better serviced under the title steampunk and the world of tomorrow it wants to make some kind of fun at the way were obsessed with technology but in a film fuelled by said technology well it carries no weight and on top of this for a film thats released by universal its exceptionally poor of them to include a joke about how minions are deities that we are obsessed with ho ho funny stuff there guys  look theres no reason to see mortal engines its not so bad its good theres no one set piece that is overly impressive  unless that is youre easily impressed by cgi noise then by all means giants cities on wheels eating smaller cities might be interesting enough the endless swooping camera movements the overly dramatic music the inconsequential characters and the nonsensical plot leave you with an empty feeling this is the sort of film that has people commenting about they could never ever spill a secret theyre sworn to keep and then in the same breath tell that secret to a stranger its the sort of film that has flashbacks to something that happened five minutes ago its a film that should have you asking how the heck did this get made  andrew is passionate about australian cinema

Feb 14 2020,negative,it borrows from many stories but doesnt have enough of its own to offer
Feb 1 2020,negative,which such promise and thrill at the start the film caves under its own weight hoping that the filmmakers would go bold or go home on this theyve gone nowhere

Aug 29 2019,negative, director christian rivers new mortal engines film answers that question with a clear grinding belching no the bloated hollywood machine cant oppose capitalism  though it can via great metal jaws eat anticapitalism for breakfast the 2001 novel mortal engines by philip reeve on which the movie is based is a bleak meditation on capitalism and imperialism disguised as an imaginative steampunk goof the book and film are set in a distant postapocalyptic future in which cities have become mobile metropolises roam the barren land chasing down and ingesting smaller cities for their raw materials the large and strong prey on the small and weak in accordance with the principles of municipal darwinism  a term that winks at the rapacious 19thcentury philosophy of social darwinism the only morality according to municipal darwinism is consume or be consumed which is reeves suggests a familiar mantra for the present day the best part of mortal engines the movie and the part of the film that is truest to the book are the visuals lord of the rings director peter jackson who developed the project is much celebrated for his baroque aesthetic that makes him a perfect fit for a grimy retrofuture nightmare the opening sequence in which a giant mobile london chases down and devours a small bavarian mining town is a masterpiece of hyperbolic hollywood magic the films look touches on terry gilliam and the early star wars films but unfolds into uniquely gritty absurdity the movie brings to life reeves world in which the early industrial age never ended and the future is an extended dickensian nightmare with monstrous gradgrinds chasing each other joylessly around a barren earth when you look closer at the grit though you start to see the telltale hollywood polish underneath the most obvious example involves the main heroine in the book hester shaw has a terrible scar that ran down her face from forehead to jaw making it look like a portrait that had been furiously crossed out her mouth is twisted her nose is a smashed stump and one of her eyes is destroyed yet in the movie shaw hera hilmar is barely disfigured she has a minor scar off to the side which if anything accentuates her leading lady perfection the rest of the movie assiduously tidies up the novels other scars as well the complicated plot is streamlined into a star wars riff complete with death star weapon and i am your father climax several of the major character deaths  which give the book a ruthless darwinian bite  are abandoned for a more standard happily ever after ending in the book the villain thaddeus valentine played by hugo weaving in the movie is a weak man who is evil because he compromises with an evil system in part out of love for his daughter in the film however hes a standardissue powerhungry megalomaniac more subtly but more tellingly the films adventure plot simply rolls over the main thematic content of the book mobile london in the novel is a wonderful mechanism but its powered by suffering katherine valentine leila george thaddeus privileged daughter learns with horror that her comfort is made possible by a throng of workers in the bowels of the city called the gut in the novels most stomachchurning scene katherine watches prison slave laborers wading in raw sewage which they are being forced to turn into experimental food they are given no other sustenance themselves unfortunately they keep dying a supervisor muses but that is just a temporary setback i am sure in mortal engines the novel the interior of capitalism is a hellscape of death and despair thats what gives the narrative its moral force the rebel group known as antitractionists wants to overthrow the cityeatcity regime of municipal darwinism they are motivated by the desire to end a social order of terrible cruelty and exploitation katherine eventually turns against her father and her city in the book because she comes to understand the brutality which powers both in the film though class politics barely exist the evil the heroes fight onscreen is not a brutal entrenched status quo instead the problem is one bad apple revolutionary valentine is fixated on developing new and dangerous weapons in the book he develops those weapons despite the objections of the citys ruler in the movie hes following the rulers plan so a parable about the cruelty of the society we live in and the need to change it becomes another story about how ambitious rebels ruin everything when they buck tradition the war valentine starts is presented in the film as a break with municipal darwinism  a dangerous innovative rupture in the capitalist system in the novel in contrast escalating violence is the logical outgrowth of a hunger for resources inanimate and human valentine is evil in the film because he insists on transforming the machine in the book hes evil because hes a cog mortal engines the film loves cogs and it loves capitalism from reeves words the filmmakers have built a machine that revels in the authenticity and imaginative impact of photogenic grime and squalor capitalism in the film is an uglybeautiful painting  a grandiose spectacle of power the wheels revolve the bellows blow the jaws crunch in surround sound its a terrible wonderful hollywood machine if someone somewhere is suffering for it in some noxious gut you wont hear them over the audiences oohs and ahs
Jun 5 2019,positive, with a book series already published and peter jacksons writing team on board to convert mortal engines ticks the boxes for any film studio looking for a moneymaking franchise with a preexisting fanbase still even with fran walsh and philippa boyens converting and jackson protege christian rivers directing he worked on storyboards across all of jacksons movies mortal engines is a movie with a great deal of promise but finds itself running out of gas before the credits roll society as we know it has long collapsed and transformed into what is described as municipal darwinism the 60 minute war destroyed much of the world and the survivors grouped together to form predator cities cities that no longer sitin one place rather they have been converted into giant roaming fortresses that rumble around the country looking for smaller societies to claim as their own led by the lord mayor crone game of throness patrick malahide london has somewhat ironically left the british shores and headed across to mainland europe looking for smaller cities to swallow up the next city in its sights happens to have a young lady called hester shaw hera hilmar in its population which is good for her  for hester intends to assassinate thaddeus valentine hugo weaving the head of londons historians for as nice as valentine seems to be hes got a dark past and it has something to do with his desire to get his hands on the very weapons that led to societys collapse after a failed attempt at valentines life hester finds herself on a road journey across the desolate wastelands of the great hunting ground with junior london historian tom robert sheehan in tow in one of those unlikely couple scenarios where the couple are actually very likely looking like a cross between howls moving castle and the video game bioshock mortal engines takes us into a rich world with a dense backstory it absolutely makes sense for a movie franchise and yet despite having a talented writing team with lord of the rings experience its in the booktomovie conversion where things have gone awry the pacing is all over the place with characters disappearing for great stretches of running time and the one subplot that has the most heart  involving a terminatorlike robot called shrike  is frustratingly underdeveloped with so much backstory to get across the film contains more exposition than a christopher nolan triple bill thats understandable but still a little heavyhanded and then theres the tone  at times it feels like the movie aimed at preteens particularly sheehans performance as tom but the scale of the violence and destruction  and the menace of shrike  is far more suitable for a postteen audience for the first two thirds of the movie theres much to be happy about it looks glorious and the mystery unfolds intriguingly but the goodwill it picks up along the way is blown when the final act devolves into citydestroying action scenes with a villain who could have been layered  and perhaps even justifiably motivated  becoming little more than a cliched megalomaniac its certainly not a disaster but with plotting as bad as this its hard to imagine mortal engines getting a boost at the box office
May 24 2019,positive, the unpopular opinion is an ongoing column featuring different takes on films that either the writer hated but that the majority of film fans loved or that the writer loved but that most others loathed were hoping this column will promote constructive and geek fueled discussion enjoy isnt it amazing how two movies with virtually the exact same plot can have such wildly different receptions take alita battle angel and mortal engines both films are set in dystopian futures and concern young women seeking retribution for harm brought to them while demonstrating a strength lacking in the face of totalitarian oppression both feature stunning special effects and a wholly realized and unique vision of the future both films also have acclaimed producers known for their own special effectsladen epic blockbusters and a cast of relative unknowns with familiar supporting players both come from source material that have cult followings and both are crammed with enough worldbuilding for multiple movies forced into a two hour run time while neither film has lit up the box office the fan reception for alita battle angel has been overwhelming while mortal engines sputtered the moment it debuted late in 2018 as much as i enjoyed alita i was shocked to discover that i enjoyed mortal engines just as much and feel it deserves a much larger audience the plot of mortal engines is stupid i say that as endearingly as i possibly can because all genre plots are pretty flimsy from star wars to avatar the overthetop characters and settings of science fiction and fantasy films require a great deal of suspension of disbelief for them to work you have to go into mortal engines with that suspension cranked to the maximum because this is a story about gigantic rolling cities a steampunk wet dream there is little logical reason for these cities to move the way they do but the broad strokes of good versus evil rich versus poor strength versus faith and love conquers all come through loud and clear mortal engines borrows heavily from george lucas saga as well as lord of the rings mad max and countless other similar franchises over the years the difference is that mortal engines has its tongue firmly in cheek for the entire film mortal engines feels very much like a peter jackson film scripted by jackson alongside frequent collaboraters phillipa boyens and fran walsh there are numerous moments throughout the film that recall jacksons earlier works like deadalive and meet the feebles there is a humor and a new zealand sensibility to the entire production which distances it from other hollywood tentpoles every character references the ancient world of the early 21st century with a nod and a wink giving us plenty of inside jokes about our technology and culture and how foreign it appears to the citizens of this fictional land but rather than come across as groanworthy it connects the viewer to this dense mythology and provides a connection point between 2019 and the landscape of mortal engines what also sets this movie apart from other fantasy epics is the lead so often the hero is someone like rey katniss everdeen or luke skywalker who embark on a heros journey to reach their full potential with mortal engines hester shaw is already midjourney and we accompany her with tom natsworthy serving as our entry into the narrative tom played by the umbrella academys robert sheehan is not the stirring protagonist you would expect at the same time hera hilmar gives one heck of a leading performance and gives us a heroine who is already well on her way to her destiny couple that with hugo weaving who is always a solid villain and you have most of the legwork done for you combine all of these elements and you have a story that has a lot of work to do in a short amount of time luckily jackson is used to telling big tales in the confines of a feature film worldbuilding has earned some negative connotations in recent years as many erroneously use it as a synonym for franchising worldbuilding requires laying the foundation for a massive fictional realm and often goes hand in hand with designing an ongoing franchise while it is highly unlikely we will ever get a sequel to mortal engines it is a shame because it was such an amazing attempt the diverse cast of characters and unique realms that populate this story could have fed multiple movies in fact i want to see prequels chronicling the adventures of anna fang jihae fang is a bit of a wasted character here meeting her demise far too early but shows that even the supporting players in this movie have enough standout qualities to warrant further investment so much of mortal engines reminded me of a teenappropriate mad max that it is fair to call this fury road lite and i mean that as a compliment the action and storyline here are worthy of george millers franchise and should have been just as lauded first time director christian rivers whose experience working with peter jackson dates all the way back to deadalive makes few missteps with mortal engines likely because his mentor was close by and helped him get his footing as a filmmaker the resulting film feels very much like if terry gilliam had directed cloud atlas and that is high praise some may say that top caliber special effects are not enough to buouy a film but mortal engines also benefits from a brilliant score by junkie xl and excellent editing by jonno woodfordrobinson the vibrant colors of the movie pop off the screen giving this movie far more life and energy than jackson gave to any of the three films in the hobbit trilogy mortal engines is a silly concept told with the highest caliber of filmmaking there is a lot of familiarity in the characters and story but the sheer creativity visually on display sets this movie apart at the same time that we see so many other movies when we watch mortal engines should be treated more as homage than as derivative mortal engines is a lot to take in and the unfamiliarity most viewers have with the source material begs repeated viewings to try and process everything on screen i already have found myself wanting to revisit this movie more than the hobbit and that is a testament to both christian rivers and peter jackson it is rare that we get such a starkly distinct movie in wide release which makes it a shame that so few gave this movie a chance but i beg you to watch it if you can and i think you will enjoy it as much as you did alita battle angel oh and if you have any suggestions for the unpopular opinion im always happy to hear them you can send along an email to email protected or spell it out in the comments below provide me with as many movie suggestions as you like with any reasoning youd care to share and if i agree then you may one day see it featured in this very column alex maidy has been a joblocom editor columnist and critic since 2012 a rotten tomatoesapproved

cinemacon for a victory lap after premiering at sxsw does it live up to the hype and give ryan gosling a clasic role
May 4 2019,neutral, as much as peter jacksons name is plastered all over this mortal engines is in fact not a jackson joint yes the lord of the rings helmer is the most likely reason this film was greenlit he serves as both coproducer and cowriter but longtime jackson collaborator christian rivers who served predominantly as a visual effects supervisor on the majority of jacksons filmography is behind the camera here  on debut no less  so perhaps its time credit is paid where its due that gripe out of the way mortal engines as loud and as ambitious as it is is not the start of another yaaimed franchise  as much as it clearly hopes to be rivers showcases visual flare behind the lens and the effects and scope of the film are where it is most successful but special effects do not a good movie make and mortal engines sadly suffers from an ensemble cast who fail to elevate the stereotypical material above expectation a morgan freemanesque voiceover informs us at the frontend of the film that we are thousands of years in the future and civilisation essentially wrecked themselves with a war that resulted in cities now being constructed as giant wheeled contraptions that roam a postapocalyptic landscape searching for whatever resources are still lying around apparently in this future cracked iphones and brandname toasters are seen as scrap gold the city that gets the most traction is london now an oversized steampowered roller thats joined together with its own selfcontained rail system and uneven streets due to the importance of history and his own knowledge of it the obviouslyvillainous thaddeus valentine hugo weaving has soared through the ranks to become the citys unofficial leader opposing our scenechewing valentine and his roaring city is the mysterious hester shaw hera hilmar sadly not possessing the type of charisma one needs to lead a film let alone a franchise a scarred and resentful orphan whose own backstory gives her all the reasons we expect as to why shes so hellbent on taking valentine down the story itself is far from being overtly original and the majority of the cast all seem rather untested in the ways of a big budget epic weaving is at least having fun and south korean musician jihae makes something of an impression as a welltailored resistance leader but hilmar and love interest robert sheehan are too bland to sustain interest but i imagine those ingredients will be overlooked and therefore forgiven for the films admittedly impressive visual structure theres a wealth of design on hand and both rivers and jackson deserve their credit in painting a familiar landscape with a fresh brush whilst i suspect younger audiences will perhaps lap up mortal engines the majority of theatre goers are likely to view this with a sense of deja vu a sprawling civilisation overseen by a tyrant roaming a wasteland whilst two opposites find love  i guess mad maxs hunger games of star wars was too long a title film critic with a penchant for dwayne johnson jason momoa michelle pfeiffer and horror movies harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news
Mar 20 2019,positive, if i have to hear one more person ask me did you read the books in response to me saying i liked mortal engines im never going to stop screaming why would i have read these books arent they written for 12yearolds am i supposed to just blindly start reading young adult adventure fiction because to do so has recently moved me a few points over on the adult acceptability meter to hell with that i just want movies and i know im going to get some static from certain people for saying this but this is actually one of my favorite movies of the year not one of the best not by a long shot but absolutely one of the best times i had in a theater mortal engines is essentially a nonstop moviequoting machine and i mean that in the best possible sense its references come fast and often remixing tropes characters plots dialogue and even set designs from just about every modern scifi and postapocalyptic story of the last few decades even moving beyond that scope to encompass enough other pieces of film history to make the case that the filmmakers are definitely onto something its the girl talk the artist not the game of movies whereas this years pitiful ready player one threw all of its inspirations and easter eggs onto the screen and expected that the simple notion of recognizability was enough to stand in for having a plot or a point mortal engines revels in its countless points of origin and turns them into something truly original and it does it all while allowing its obscuretothepointofimpenetrable worldbuilding to simply be tossing in hints as to what it all really means while playing it cool and admitting that eh its actually not even all that important this is what life is like a thousand years in the future weird doesnt even begin to describe it there are the standard script problems inherent to even the best of the genre but even those are buried under the sheer colossal weight of whats on screen i barely think i could handle watching something like this in 3d and the films most glaring fault is trying to make me believe anyone no matter what century theyre living in could look at hugo weaving and not guess that hes probably the most evil person in any given room mortal engines plays almost like a bridge between the kidfriendly and more adultfocused works of terry gilliam the wachowskis jeanpierre jeunet and hayao miyazaki it steals from the greats and gets away with it because it wants you to notice and it wants you to care and like all great acts of cinematic theft it works whether you actually notice all that or not there are cloud cities robot zombies evil governments ancient societies steampunk architecture even a quick and bizarre cameo from those hideous yellow temazepam demons the minions as i said weird having been unceremoniously dumped right into spiderman and aquaman season the movie will come and go quickly i have no idea what a fan of the book might think of the film but as a movie fan its the best and most surprising early christmas present i could have hoped for rated pg13 for sequences of futuristic violence and action  the comments section is here to provide a platform for civil dialogue on the issues we face together as a local community xpress is committed to offering this platform for all voices but when the tone of the discussion gets nasty or strays off topic we believe many people choose not to participate xpress editors are determined to moderate comments to ensure a constructive interchange is maintained all comments judged not to be in keeping with the spirit of civil discourse will be removed and repeat violators will be banned see here for our terms of service thank you for being part of this effort to promote respectful discussion yeah greatly underrated much better than the usual marvel fare weve been getting seriously aquaman was so dead boring compared to this but maybe the problem here is the story telling and style is not american enough for us audiences  and critics some of the reviews seriously   these people have no imagination or sense of adventure whatsoever  similar but much better than a lot of the starwars movies
Mar 5 2019,negative,its sorta the young adult version of the road warrior and mad max a world full of crazy engines and and stories and cities that are moving around it feels very derivative
Mar 2 2019,negative, the trailers and the fact that the lord of the rings peter jackson is the producer behind this film set in a postapocalyptic world intrigued me the story is set in a world that has been destroyed by the ancients that is us and what is left are giant mobile mechanical cities that travel from place to place to find food and other resources to keep them running when one of the smaller mobile cities gets swallowed up by the gigantic mobile city called london its inhabitants are forced to go through a tight security checkpoint as their former home is stripped for valuable old world technology that london needs hester accuses thaddeus of killing her mother but before she can deliver the fatal blow she is stopped by tom robert sheehan a young man who works in a museum hester escapes tom gives chase and when he catches her before she can fall off a platform she tells him the truth about thaddeus she breaks free from toms grip and falls to the ground below when tom tells thaddeus what hester has told him thaddeus pushes him off the platform tom survives the fall and tags along with hester trying to find a way back the duo gets into some trouble but are rescued by anna fang jihae the leader of a resistance group who are trying to put a stop to the moving cities filling up the rest of the story is the revelation of hesters past and thaddeus true motivations viewers familiar with the current political climate might get the references to britains brexit saga and us president donald trumps antiimmigration stance those who dont will just not care
Feb 20 2019,negative, with peter jackson serving as executive producer mortal engines should feel like more of an event  one with beautifully realized visual effects and the sort of highfantasy spectacle weve come to expect from the filmmaker behind the lord of the rings but the dystopian ya adaptation a description that has become redundant is hitting theaters with a whisper fitting given its lackluster action sequences and a tepid and predictable story which reads like a steampunk retread of star wars by way of final fantasy  it doesnt help that mortal engines  based on the ya book series by philip reeve  is going up against highly anticipated holiday blockbusters like mary poppins returns and aquaman unless that release tactic was meant to reflect the films basic plot about a scrappy underdog going up against a massive bureaucracy that has become a literal machine it wasnt the film from director christian rivers takes place hundreds of years in the future after a cataclysmic event has destroyed the world as we know it cities have become motorized behemoths on wheels and giant airships some people have chosen to live in static cities on the ground london is a massive tank that consumes other smaller and poorer cities salvaging its artifacts and consuming its metal for fuel under orders from an aging dictatortype the residents of london cheer these violent consumerist acts all of the metaphors are exceedingly literal but this is a movie for well its allegedly for young people and fans of the book series but it feels more like a movie produced by the lord of the rings and harry potter section of hot topic  the main cast of characters includes hester shaw hera hilmar a young woman fighting the resistance against london and seeking revenge for the murder of her mother at the hands of thaddeus valentine hugo weaving  a villain whose exact role in london beyond being cartoonishly evil is unclear wikipedia says hes the head of the guild of historians which houses such artifacts as sunbeam toasters iphones and statues of minions because this is a universal film and that ip is free our young male hero is tom natsworthy robert sheehan a historian who once dreamt of becoming an aviator which predictably pays off during the climax tom reluctantly joins forces with hester and anna fang south korean star jihae the fugitive leader of the antitraction league  a resistance group fighting against cities like london which seek only to destroy and consume theres also a giant robotic creature called shrike stephen lang who was once a human man and is now a soulless hunk of metal that curiously resembles nick valentine from the fallout games  a lawsuit waiting to happen  hester is essentially the luke skywalker of the film and although tom has some piloting experience his encyclopedic knowledge and constant chatter basically makes him the c3po in this scenario anna fang is the han solo here with her awesome old school rpgesque airship and unlimited swagger she is the young han solo we truly deserve mortal engines culminates in a largely airbased battle resembling the sequence in which luke skywalker leads a squadron of fighterpilots to infiltrate the death star without spoiling anything a thirdact reveal is almost identical to a major plot point in the star wars universe and yet mortal engines lacks the entertainment value found in even the lowliest of star wars movies  the prequels id happily trade the bland robert sheehan for a hopping yoda in a heartbeat  while the design of the massive rolling cities is certainly novel and intriguing the action sequences leave quite a bit to be desired its the sort of inelegant poorly edited mishmash of digital nonsense that makes your eyes glaze over the mind wanders to more interesting topics like i wonder what my cat is doing right now just to keep your brain active dont worry by the time your attention returns to the film at hand you wont have missed anything  and even if you did the dialogue is consistently expository  perhaps if universal released mortal engines in the doldrums of january or february it might have arrived with more than a whimper  not quite a bang but maybe a thump at the very least one might assume that jacksons involvement as executive producer and cowriter with frequent collaborators fran walsh and philippa boyens would elicit more interest and yield a higher quality of product especially given that the popularity of the mortal engines book series pales in comparison to that of the wizarding worlds and hobbit holes and such but maybe this is the level of quality that jackson  co thought fitting for the source material perhaps they were operating one of those donate what you feel is appropriate models if thats the case then they certainly achieved what they set out to do  the bare minimum
Feb 7 2019,negative,a botch more concerned with creating a wouldbe franchise than in making a movie entertaining enough to make audiences want to see more
Feb 4 2019,positive, moments of truly spectacular bigbudget filmmaking is undercut  by personality void performances and hohum storytelling making mortal engines a film that knows how to  rev its engines but doesnt have enough gas to fulfil its franchise potential the lord of the rings trilogy indeed  was masterful filmmaking the story the stunning new zealand location the  battle scenesall of this and much more woven together to create a tapestry of  cinematic greatness worthy of all praise and awards what many often overlook  is the casting an assemblage of character actors from various corners of the globe  that took on their iconic characters created by jrr tolkien and made them  their own mortal engines  the latest bigbudget epic from the lotr trio peter jackson fran walsh  and philippa boyens fails to capitalise on that fact directed by christian rivers mortal engines is based on  the first of four young adult adventure fantasy novels that takes place in a  postapocalyptic world sigh where cities are now monstrous vehicles that rove  the long barren terrains of earth the biggest and prosperous of these is  london where chief engineer thaddeus valentine hugo weaving seeks even  greater conquests no matter the consequence standing in his way is hester shaw  hera hilmar a mysterious figure from this past who seeks revenge  with a budget of 100 million there is no denying that mortal engines aims to overwhelm with  its larger than life visuals and impressive world building yet it doesnt take  much to find that under its veneer there are many problems to this would be  saga namely a dire absence of character and stakes to differentiate this madmax for millennials from any other ya nonsense that came before it the casting of  personality bereft leads in hera hilmar and robert sheehan does not help in  engrossing its audience into its world and in its inhabitants if there was  ever a potential franchise that needed a shot of star power this would be it what is impressive with mortal engines is its ability to have the audience say wow  during key moments of big scale action brilliance rivers who was an art  director on the hobbit clearly has learned a thing or two from jackson on  how to work on a large landscape its just a shame that the smaller things  that make a big picture epic did not get the same love
Jan 15 2019,positive, peter jackson chose not to direct the spectacular postapocalyptic mortal engines but he wrote the screenplay adaptation with longtime screenwriting partners fran walsh and philippa boyen and he closely supervised every aspect of this grandiose scifi riff thats set a thousand years from now engines begins with a riveting chase as london a predator city on gigantic treads and wheels pursues a small city that it intends to literally devour cities in this landscape are on the move a towering ramshackle compact of neighborhoods parks and libraries stacked with weapons buildings boiler rooms and hordes of people these edifices roam desolate barren landscapes like great harvesting combines in search of fuel and food from the start mortal engines adapted from philip reeves book is so immensely ambitious in its startling size and scale invention and details it suggests that in the wake of the hobbit and the lord of the rings franchises jackson can do  and spend  anything he wants if only that had been matched by the lackluster too predictable scenario jackson and firsttime director christian rivers an oscar winner for visual effects on jacksons king kong have a youthful photogenic quartet to lead this adventures twisty path of thwarting world domination thats the dream of the dastardly deceitful murderous thaddeus valentine a despot whose name must be a joke  this killer has no heart played with a gleeful sneer by aussie hugo weaving the matrix valentine is about a subtle as a blowtorch only his smart beautiful but unaware daughter katherine leila george her actor parents are vincent donofrio of full metal jacket and greta scacchi recently seen in operation finale is naive enough to trust this duplicitous schemer as mortal kicks its storytelling gear into drive thaddeus survives vengeancedriven hester shaws icelands hera hilmar assassination attempt hester escapes aided by tom irelands robert sheehan the films swashbuckling costar eventually katherine bonds with belvis pod dublins ronan raferty against dad an unseen stephen lang is the voice of shrike a resurrected man meaning an android who like thaddeus has a complicated past that intersects with hester
Jan 11 2019,negative, its been 10 years since peter jackson picked up philip reeves seminal ya novel and decided to shepherd it to the silver screen mortal engines is finally rolling into cinemas and like the mighty traction cities it depicts the end result is cumbersome unwieldy and belching waste thankfully the one thing jackson is best at  detailed world design  is put to good use in mortal engines each motorised metropolis is something to behold the film walks a knifeedge between corny visual references and fascinating infrastructure porn as the landmarks of london are reimagined on wheels  from the austere dome of st pauls to the everpresent routemaster bus these visual gags land a lot better than the vocal ones  mortal engines chucks in the odd political jibe about trump and brexit but these throwaway lines clash with the films allegorical and escapist vibes unfortunately while the cityvscity squareoffs are breathtaking human fight sequences are choppy and forgettable a large part of this is due to the characters  some of the series most interesting characters are distilled down to cookiecutter clich√© take shrike this fan favourite is boiled down to pirate terminator and a perfectlycast stephen lang is wasted behind inconsistent and boring cgi and our two leads impressively forgettable even by the standards of the young adult film genre  well see if they even get a niche tumblr following this numbing wasteful approach is applied to every interesting character and theme from the book series  at least you can say that mortal engines is consistent those unfamiliar with the mortal engines series are advised to skip this bland and choppy offering and book fans we should have learned from the hobbit stay clear if you like your childhood memories untarnished by peter jackson synopsis a mysterious young woman named hester shaw joins forces with anna fang a dangerous outlaw with a bounty on her head and tom natsworthy an outcast from london to lead a rebellion against a giant predator city on wheels i have a dog and sometimes i see films ill yell about either at any given opportunity say a bad word about troy 2002 or cockapoos i dare you
Jan 10 2019,negative,mortal engines does not have the capacity or the grace to be a simple adventure or to take flight full review in spanish
Jan 10 2019,negative,there is very little the cast could do with roles so superficial and without cores full review in spanish
Jan 7 2019,negative,theres something supremely cool going on here and at times you can catch sight of it but not often enough to make up for what it squanders
Jan 4 2019,neutral, the story humans live in cities on wheels because the land has been destroyed by war among the largest of these is london which engulfs smaller wheeled cities for their resources there tom robert sheehan a junior historian meets hester hera hilmar a fugitive she has infiltrated london to kill the politician thaddeus valentine hugo weaving adapted from the 2001 novel of the same name by philip reeve  a nautical adventure in everything but name this movie has all the ingredients for a great pirate yarn massive moving fortresses attack each other at a stately speed cannons roaring heroes clamber on rigging as captains train their spyglasses on the horizon looking for prey call this one pirates of the apocalypse because this is set on earth thousands of years in the future a magnificent setting but one marred by dialogue more leaden than a cannonball and weakly constructed characters all of whom  in the best piratical fashion  feel taken from other better films this is a production that does not let the viewer forget that the might and majesty of peter jackson maker of the lord of the rings 2001 to 2003 and the hobbit films 2012 to 2014 is behind it he is here as producer the director is newcomer christian rivers a protege of the hitmaker who arrives here after a career as a visual artist in jacksons wingnut films hester icelandic actress hilmar and her bloodlust drive the story with the hapless tom sheehan there mainly to react with fear and to have plot explained to him as the story progresses with some obvious foreshadowing and a giant helping of flashback the stakes suddenly go from revenge to something with more global impact the long and spectacular action sequences taking place on land sea and air go some way towards dispelling the tedium of the star warslite story the real star of the show is the set design it is as per jackson magnificent the steampunk aesthetic has never looked so good on screen but it is a shame that one notices it so much because the people in the foreground are so bland
Jan 3 2019,negative, mortal engines is based on the book by philip reevethe first of a quartet of stories about hester shaw tom natsworthy and the postapocalyptic future in which they live traction cities roam the globe giant mobile beasts that hunt and repurpose each other for parts and resources just go with it their municipal darwinism is at odds with the antitraction league who live in what wed call normal cities and townsthe kind that dont roll about on giant treads or wheels crushing everything in their path the films first 24 minutes which i first saw at new york comic con build a sense of scale and momentum thats exactly right for a movie that centers on a mobile london massive and terrifying and full of people who seem to have all the morality of your average citizen of panems capitol they cheer and applaud as london chases down a small mining town sucking it into the bigger citys maw for processing theres whizbang fun to the way the smaller city folds in on itself as it races away and to the sweeping views of london that illustrate its sheer size and its dramatic class divides as london chases the smaller town tom natsworthy robert sheehan races to get to his job in the museum which is full of old tech remnants of the idiotic ancients read us who destroyed the world in the sixtyminute war on the smaller city hester shaw hera hilmar stares intently at london checking her knife and waiting for her moment i love this opening sequence it introduces nearly everyone we need to know from tom and hester and hugo weavings thaddues valentine to valentines daughter katherine leila george and the smugy pompous herbert melliphant andrew lees who would like to kick tom back to the lower levels from which he came colin salmon perhaps better known as oliver queens stepdad in arrows early seasons has a nice little role as deliciously named museum director chudleigh pomeroy if the score works a little too hard to remind you that this is a chase in a postapocalyptic world like mad max fury road guyswell fine i can accept that at least while everything else is progressing so nicely but as soon as hester having boarded london but failed in her quest to murder thaddeus valentine slips awayand tom follows pushed by valentinethe movie starts to founder theres a lightness and a sense of curiosity to that first sequence that balances hesters murderous intensity her anger drives mortal engines plot as it should but this isnt a dark and gritty story nor is it the sort of archetypal mythic tale cowriter and coproducer peter jackson tells so well its a more grounded story one about hurt and revenge and the kind of men who believe that they know whats best for the whole world its got its hands dirty but its also charming and clever and inventive the moment when pomeroy rushes to save his american deitiestwo big minions figuresis just right his museum is being rattled to bits by londons pursuit of the smaller town but inside that giant traction beast people go about their lives and smaller things matter to them so its more than a bit jarring when the film veers entirely off course for a campy sequence involving teaserving human traffickers and a slave auction scene in which everyones wearing terrible wigs and seem to have stepped off the set of some lowbudget 80s film the tone never quite recovers everything after that awkward sequence is selfserious to a fault but even as it loses its sense of humor mortal engines doesnt know how to address its own weight to free the shrike a metal man ok fine a knockoff terminator voiced by stephen lang with his own reasons for hunting hester valentine knocks a whole prison into the ocean yes hes a monster but the movie has no interest in the fact that he just drowned a lot of people the same goes for the refuge of airhaven which plummets to the ground in a fiery wreck of course it does you know thats going to happen as soon as you see the sign warning against open flame the thing is not everything is wrong its mostly just not quite right as aviator anna fang jihae is perfect casually slinking across the screen as she turns up just in time to save hester from the slave auction alas her big fight sequence is a choppy poorly framed muddle annas ship the jenny haniver looks like a gorgeous red steampunk dragonfly but her dialogue is full of groaners the script saddles her with pronouncements and minispeeches that might work in conversation but just sound absurd as important statements trying to pass as character work shes not the only one burdened with such lines but she might have the most of them sheehan hits just the right tone for tom earnest to the point of naivet√© but also smart and caringbut then for just one example the script makes him waste a long minute in the final battle picking out a new jacket theres no chemistry between him and hesterthis story takes place over mere daysbut were still treated to scenes like the one in which a dying shrike why does he die at this incredibly convenient moment no idea decides that hester doesnt want tom to die because she loves him its not as if there couldnt be any other reason maybe its that theyre turning out to be pretty good partners that theyve been through hell together already and dont want to be alone that people generally dont want to watch other people get murdered in front of them let alone whilst hanging about on a giant falling airtown but this scriptcowritten by jackson and his regular writing partners philippa boyens and fran walshtoo often cuts the wrong corners it streamlines the story in ways that make sense then still insists on keeping characters that we really dont need katherine valentine though i like her is largely superfluous and though hesters facial scar is hugely toned down from the books the script is still full of references to how ugly she is none of which make a lick of sense given what she looks like on screen this disconnect is aggravated by rivers infuriating comments about how audiences need to believe that tom and hester fall in lovewhich would apparently boggle our tiny shallow minds were hester as scarred on film as she is on the page mortal engines is all told too big and too small at once rivers is pretty good at the big stuffan airborne attack on londons spotlights and guns at the end is both heavily influenced by star wars and surprisingly satisfyinghe cant stick the landing on the smaller moments whether character development or smallerscale action after that rich opening sequence much of the film feels like a very expensive cgi outline that has yet to be filled in even the effects get wobblier the green screens more obvious the dialogue blander and blander at the same time there are visual moments that are pure inventive delight like the buglike mobile home hester and tom fall into or the variety of designs for the aviators ships every traction city we see is different from architecture to storage to engine someone cared about building this world they just forgot to build the characters of the people who live in it remember how the golden compass was a terribly disappointing movie that didnt have to be terrible how it was in some ways brilliantly cast eva green as serafina pekkala forever and how cool it was to see dust on screen and lyra and iorekand then the whole thing just crumbled into a muddle that in no way felt like philip pullmans book while mortal engines source material is a different sort of beast the result is the same a movie that couldve been good at least it couldve had anything to say about valentinesand by extension londonsinsistence that everyone who doesnt want to live like him is therefore trying to destroy him it couldve developed the characters of the antitractionists who seem like the most interesting folks on screen but instead its simply another mediocre adaptation that will probably never get a sequel molly templeton would like to call a doover on this whole thing but thats not how it works if you would also like to moan about what couldve been you can find her on twitter there is an art to smiling in a way that others will believe it is always important to include the eyes otherwise people will know you hate them

Dec 24 2018,neutral, imagine if new  york was completely mobile not if everyone in the five boroughs which for those of you who have not seen gotti are queens brooklyn manhattan staten island the bronx had mobile phones  thats not very hard to imagine at all more along the lines of what if the entire city was on wheels roaming through some sort of postnuclear wasteland tundra and what if it had the ability to take a similarly moving smaller town  say hazard kentucky or maybe monrovia indiana  and just swallow it up the captured populace would be forced to give up their way of life after being absorbed into the victors workforce their old burg would be smashed to bits you could see how that might be a pretty potent metaphor for paranoia over cultural coastal elites and bigcityvsrealamerica argumentstoking right were guessing the folks behind this adaptation of philip reeves novel noticed it as well in addition to how his intriguing highconcept 2001 book is the first in a quartet and my wouldnt it be lovely to have a franchise the warshiplike behemoth that we see chasing down a tiny speedy burg in the movies opening is not gotham but london its prey isnt an everyplace from our midwest but some generic miningtown named salthook meant to represent every industrial burg fallen on hard times as for the money shot of this massive urban giant sucking the jalopy of a village into is maw  prepare to ingest is the command thats issued  its indeed awesome in the traditional sense of the word any outsidethemultiplex messaging however pretty much starts and stops there unless you count the be aware that children may be temporarily separated from parents warning over a loudspeaker the writerproducer trio of peter jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens were all responsible for the lord of the rings and hobbit trilogies as was their longtime collaborator christian rivers the films director  so their business is fantasy the more farout the better their not here to make parallels per se they want to give you a scifi extravaganza  some sort of steampunkonsteroids metropocalypse now and theyre willing to use the spare parts of dozens of other movies to make it happen a partial list of lenders would include the terminator snowpiercer frankenstein the road warrior howls moving castle star wars and every wwii dogfight epic that inspired it brazil and other gilliamesque romps notably his meaning of life short the crimson permanent assurance and every third roger dean paintingalbum cover all sort of herosjourney narratives come into play from the ordinary young man thrown into extraordinary circumstances  in this case a tinkering nerd named tom natsworthy robert sheehan  to someone on a vengeance quest eg a scarred rebel named hester shaw hera hilmar theres a villain played by hugo weaving with his patented matrixlevel of malevolence whos been gathering vintage weaponsgrade tech for a  wait for it  vintage weapon as a bonus the movie throws in a robotautomaton character thats both a tormentor and tragic and a han sololike rogue pilotoutlaw who goes by the handle anna fang shes played by jihae kim a musician with an illegal amount of screen presence and who in a perfect nondystopian world would be cast in at least half of the movies coming out next year its not a what you steal but how well you synthesize of course and mortal engines does a decent enough job of blending a shitton of your favorite movies books tv shows etc together for a bit yet the result still feels like an offbrand blockbuster something that doesnt track as a bigscreen take on a beloved book series so much as a collection of narrative notions  like a project that never quite got past the conceptualart phase as a distraction its inoffensive but you can tell it wants to be the juggernaut on wheels the unstoppable giant mowing down or devouring everything in its path its really the smaller thing trying desperately to outrun oblivion its all scraps and nothing but
Dec 21 2018,positive, based on the first in a series of young adult novels by philip reeve mortal engines is yet another film set in a postapocalyptic future wherein food and water are scarce the strong prey on the weak and mennen speed sticks and other hygienic niceties have doubtless long ceased to exist the largest cities have been placed on wheels and roam the wastelands devouring smaller towns ie integrating the citizenry into their own but stealing all of their resources london is the largest of such burgs practicing what is known as municipal darwinism and its chief architect is thaddeus valentine hugo weaving who of course is soon revealed to be a murderous opportunist its up to the bitter hester shaw hera hilmar and the na√Øve tom natsworthy robert sheehan to bring him down although they have plenty of allies  chief among them are a rebel leader known as anna fang singer jihae and valentines own daughter leila george the plot is both daft and derivative theres even a vaderfriendly no i am your father moment and the commonplace ya elements end up overtaking the welcome wtf moments by the end but because this comes from peter jackson here in producing and scripting modes and many other folks involved with the lord of the rings the worldbuilding is spectacular and almost makes this worth the price of admission steampunk is the driving style here and this might be the first liveaction movie to successfully mimic the design of hayao miyazakis animated epics howls moving castle and castle in the sky loom large and while theres no catbus coopted from my neighbor totoro there is a camouflaged vehicle that scurries along like a metallic caterpillar like its setting mortal engines ultimately becomes too cluttered for its own good and the final showdown feels endless but there are some compensations among the characters tom makes for a bland protagonist but hesters backstory provides her with some interesting shadings and then theres shrike stephen lang an intriguing figure whos two parts terminator one part grinch like the good arnie t800 hes hesters former protector like the bad arnie t800 he becomes her hunter and like the dr seuss grouch hes noticeably lacking a heart of course theres eventually a scene where his nonexistent heart somehow ends up growing three sizes that day to quote from another shakespearean work if this were played upon a stage now i could condemn it as an improbable fiction but since its a movie being played upon a screen i merely take such nonsense in stride
Dec 21 2018,negative, when disney and sony reached an agreement a couple of years ago to allow spidey into the marvel cinematic universe an apparent loophole allowed sony to produce animated spiderman movies now theyve exploited that and produced the best animated movie of 2018 by focusing on the black teenaged miles morales version of spiderman introducing him to a halfdozen other spidermen and women and a pig from other dimensions and combining that with creative animation directors bob persichetti peter ramsey rodney rothman have created the best spidey film since sam raimis 2004 spiderman 2 the film is coproduced by the lego movie auteurs phil lord and chris miller with lord getting a story credit and theres so much to love here the visual style the depiction of new york city where its the present day but at the same time thanks to graffitied subway cars it sort of feels like 1992 excellent voiceovers by brian tyree henry and mahershala ali as miles father and uncle respectively the characterization of an older version of the peter parker spiderman voiced by jake johnson which is surprisingly poignant even the stan lee cameo usually an afterthought is especially heartbreaking following lees recent death does spiderman into the spiderverse suffer at all as nothing less than the fourth launch of a new spiderman series since 2002 not really its so different and so expansive that i didnt mind  danish filmmaker lars von trier returns with the house that jack built his first film in five years its a movie thats so consistent with the themes of the directors previous workviolence narcissism longwindednessthat von trier cant resist including clips of some of his own past movies at one point set in the 1970s in an unnamed part of the us the film stars matt dillon as jack a prolific serial killer we see several of his murders carried out with varying degrees of depravity but the film also spends much of its time on voiceovers including an interview device that isnt explained until the end in which jack pontificates about art architecture hitler and why he hates women throughout he sounds like a pretentious middleaged man who just discovered the work of jordan peterson if jack existed in the present day instead of the 70s hed never kill anyone because hed be too busy with his youtube channel some think this movie is hilarious but im not seeing that except for a stuntcasting joke at the end that made me smile i mostly found the film a gross unpleasant slog despite a capable turn from dillon who doesnt get used nearly enough these days its been a long time since peter jackson last made a good movie and the dry spell continues with mortal engines which answers a burning question what if mad max fury road had sucked written and produced by jackson and his wife fran walsh and directed by jackson prot√©g√© christian rivers mortal engines is based on everybodys favorite a fantasy novel with four sequels its the postapocalyptic future and in a notsosubtle allegory of imperialism the city of london is now predatory ambulatory and extremely steampunk as a dictator type hugo weaving moves it around the planet in order to gobble up other places and civilizations at the center of the story is hester icelandic actressdiscount kristen stewart hera hilmar a young woman out for revenge against the bad guys shes assisted by robert sheehan a poor orphan who really wants to fly planes mortal engines is an obvious rehash of george millers great 2015 mad max fury road minus just about every one of that films positive qualities the action is choppy and boring the characters are terrible the effects are garish cgi instead of practical and none of the stakes are compelling and then after 90 minutes the film suddenly stops ripping off mad max and pivots to star wars complete with a death starlike weapon a lukestyle assault on it and a score thats a brazen knockoff of john williams the worldbuilding is so pisspoor that the nuclear holocaust that kicks off the film is hardly explained and quickly an afterthought its never especially clear which direction the characters are going and what their motivation is and probably the worst choice is that the film treats one characters death with wistful music and a treacly montage when everything weve learned is that the character was essentially an abusive stepfather mary queen of scots pales in comparison to the favourite and even to the otherwise mostly forgettable outlaw king a typically winning performance in the title role by saoirse ronan cant save a tepid boring historical drama directed by josie rourke a firsttimer from the london theater scene mary was written by beau willimon who with the ides of march and house of cards has cornered the market across multiple media on mediocre works about political intrigue the film tells the story of mary ronan and her feud with cousin queen elizabeth i margot robbie complicating things are that the two never met in real life so the movie invents a meeting scene thats really the only time the film comes alive i get the point the films trying to makeboth women faced pressures and challenges that they in no way deserved especially elizabeth who is portrayed by a miscast robbie as a smallpoxaddled grotesquerie but the lackluster script just cant find a way to make any of this interesting opening this film at the same as the favourite which attempts most of the same things but does all of them much better was nearly an act of studio malpractice
Dec 21 2018,neutral,this big budget effectsladen movie about a strange postapocalyptic world where predator cities roll around on tanklike treads looks great but the story of romance and revenge is just barely adequate
Dec 21 2018,negative,the last two acts drag it down it just goes star wars
Dec 21 2018,negative,i fell asleep i was getting tired of these people and the funny thing is that i put everything together
Dec 21 2018,neutral,this shouldve been amazing even the ending owes itself to another filmit feels like a bunch of movies weve seen before that are better than this
Dec 21 2018,positive, to its credit it doesnt really feel like a stab at that potentially lucrative market where crummy movies such as hunger games can pay off big dividends produced and written by the lord of the rings trio of peter jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens it layers a certain loopy majesty on a premise that is well pretty strange roughly 1000 years into the future the world is a realm of fugitives and scavengers save for the residents of predator cities roving metropolises on giant caterpillar tracks capable of swallowing whole the small towns foraging in its path think mad max attempting to speed away from an ambulatory brisbane and you get the idea in the opening sequence the city of london commanded by thaddeus valentine hugo weaving descends on and ingests a mining town ripping apart the structure for fuel and presumably enslaving its citizens restraint points to director christian rivers for bucking any urge to set the whole sequence to the clashs london calling one young woman in the town scarfaced hester shaw hera hilmar uses the occasion to make an attempt on the life of valentine but is stopped from her mission by ambitious archeologist tom natsworthy robert sheehan who hopes to be mentored by the powerful london kingpin that doesnt work out soon both hester and tom are abandoned in the wasteland and valentine is seeking information on his mysterious attacker a pursuit that leads to the barely human shrike stephen lang in a motioncapture performance a battle cyborg resurrected from the body of a soldier ages earlier shrike is released from his prison to fulfil his stated mission killing hester that frees valentine to pursue a mission of his own employing the same technology that all but destroyed the world to take power for himself much to the growing consternation of his daughter katherine leila george productionwise the film is a cut above the hunger games ilk while this is a first feature for rivers producer jackson knows a thing or two about creating a strange new world from whole digital cloth and the film is rife with vistas desolate and beautiful as antagonists go shrike is an especially impressive creation suggesting what would happen if an iron giantstyle robot opted for an operating system of pure malevolence for the lead roles the film opted for comparative unknowns a risky proposition notwithstanding precedents along the lines of star wars hilmar brings a certain fury to the role possibly driven by having to act out the clich√© of the beautiful woman who believes herself to be hideous because of a facial scar as tom sheehan brings a dangerous amount of academic twit to the role making for an unusual if not altogether likable hero the film is an adaptation of the first in a series of books by philip reeve and given the critical drubbing the movie is getting  its currently 30 per cent at rotten tomatoes  its not likely any film sequels will be forthcoming
Dec 20 2018,negative, its some years into a dystopian future and marauding city machines  like laputa in castle in the sky or howls moving castle  rove around on wheels in search of smaller weaker city machines to absorb and enslave the cruellest imperialists of the lot live in the city of london an endlessly greedy empire determined to gobble all of continental europe knowing all the while that their own system is unsustainable insert your own punchline here within the city limits a dashing apprentice historian tom natsworthy the impossibly charismatic robert sheehan collects old tech and heroically intervenes when a mysterious young woman named hester shaw attempts to assassinate the ambitious head of the guild of historians thaddeus valentine hugo weaving its a hugo weaving character what could possibly go wrong thus tom and resourceful rebel hester find themselves dumped out of london and into the badlands and then theyre kidnapped by ozploitationfriendly slave traders and a terminator named shrike chases them and theyre rescued by anna fang a swaggering turn from the south korean pop star jihae the leader of the antitraction league a resistance group and then theres a bomb and so on christian rivers peter jacksons longtime storyboard artist makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of philip reeves awardwinning novel a lavish spectacular messy picture containing some thrilling set pieces and far too much tedious worldbuilding mortal engines never quite settles on a protagonist  tom hester and anna are all in the running  making for a lopsided narrative that still somehow diligently hits every predictable genre beat were not going to tell each other our sad stories harrumphs hester about 20 minutes before she trots out the first of two tragic backstories two even the collective screen charms of sheehan and jihae cant compensate for the projects lack of personality as impressive as it looks mortal engines is pathologically wedded to its steampunk aesthetic often it feels like being battered half to death with a copy of cherie priests boneshaker even the goggles seem to have goggles in the moments before the crucial savetheworld climax tom turns back so that he can face his steampunk waterloo wearing a more steampunky jacket no one blinks an eye
Dec 19 2018,negative,nothing about mortal engines works not the story not the aesthetics not the performances nothing just tow this clunker to the junkyard and be done with it
Dec 18 2018,neutral, a thousand years in the future when the population has been decimated by war and society is starting over again the hot new trend in municipal planning is traction cities where entire towns are built on massive machines that travel on enormous tank treads roaming the countryside like pirate ships theyre small as cities go maybe the size of a couple city blocks  still pretty big to be out rolling around europe this is mortal engines adapted by peter jackson and friends from the first of philip reeves four young adult novels directed by firsttimer christian rivers with all the enthusiasm of someone whos getting his big break and cant do anything about the boring script his producers handed him on the good ship london a feckless young apprentice named tom natsworthy robert sheehan teams up with justifiably angry irish lass hester shaw hera hilmar to bring down the sinister thaddeus valentine hugo weaving a london leader who killed hesters mother in his quest to find a legendary weapon that could make london even more of a giant deadly bully than it already is theres a resistance made up of people who understand that traction cities are unsustainable they require incredible amounts of fuel giving tom and hester a group to join theyve created an awesome world here with cool sets and steampunk devices  like a teen version of mad max fury road but the story is wholly unremarkable composed of the generic beats youve seen in other ya adaptations and the characters are all forgettable theres not a single noteworthy performance in the bunch not even from hugo weaving as the villain like the rolling city of london the movie is a gigantic lumbering waste of resources populated by nobody interesting
Dec 18 2018,negative, ive been at turns frustrated and fascinated by the new scifi film mortal engines in the leadup to its release a giant tale about mobile cities ingesting smaller cities and the kids trying to stop them was always going to be an odd sell to those not directly familiar with philip reeves young adult novels that producer peter jackson has been enamored with for decades now but it got made anyway  heres some haphazardlyexplained exposition for you in the middle of the 21st century a series of quantum weapons called medusa destroyed pretty much all of the large cities of the world and ruined the earths crust and then weve got moving cities hooray or at least thats how rivers and jackson explain it though its not really wellexplained in the film a quick look at the books wikipedia page will tell you that survivors from those destroyed cities moved into those mobile cities in order to escape the constantlychanging weather conditions like earthquakes or giant storms caused by the earths crust being fucked with its somewhere in the far future and young hester shaw hera hilmar is onboard a small city that in the films thrilling 20 minutes gets consumed by the giant moving city of london london is a bit of a wonder complete with tube stations and the london museum of old artifacts the latter where our coprotagonist tom natsworthy robert sheehan works he meets hester by happenstance when shes about to assassinate thaddeus valentine hugo weaving the leader of the guild of historians for murdering her mother natsworthy and shaw are thrown off of london and have to fend for themselves against a whole host of enemies so that they can stop valentine from attempting to revive the medusa project to wreck havoc on the citys enemies anyways the effects work as with every film that the good folks at weta digital work on is as brilliant as it normally is the cities have a brutal heft to them and their stacked design makes them wonderfully interesting to look at the airships as well are distinct  swashbuckler anna fangs little red ship looks like if the swordfish from cowboy bebop were more of a lobster and if i were ten years old still id probably be running around my town to figure out if i could buy a model kit of it the action is filmed well enough which was to be a given thanks to rivers past experience with jackson and when the film goes full star wars knockoff in the last half hour it at least looks somewhat fun seriously i was humming this throughout the entire airshiplondon battle  one wonders when jacksons finally just going to suck it up and make his dam busters remake however this is all a bit funny given that all of these scenes are memorable because they look nothing like the rest of the film which is shot like an exceptionally bad bbc adaptation of a dickens novel just in a steampunk universe the action when it doesnt involve any effects work is about as poorly photographed as any herkyjerky bullshit youd find in a shakycam action film and thats a big downgrade from jacksons clear action work in all of his prior films including those like this that hes produced theres not much in mortal engines to hang ones thematic hat on there are slight references to conspicuous consumption colonialism and more baked into the film which im assuming are a bit more of the point in the novels that the film is based on but rivers largely ignores them for a dont repeat the mistakes of the past message you know the one youll find in pretty much every movie about overlyambitious scientists dealing with tech they dont really understand yet these nods are roughly enough to give the film a color that much like jupiter ascending and plenty of other films before it sort of lives and dies on its imagery more so than its storytelling  is mortal engines a bad movie hell yeah it absolutely is its probably one of the worst movies ive seen this year on a storytelling level it overextends the meager powers of its director may cause its cast not to have as long and as profitable careers as they would otherwise and is virtually identical at least from a financial standpoint as universals studio head lighting a 100 million on fire yet warts and all is it a blast to roll with when the going is good  all of the action sequences involving effects work weavings celluloid chewing  and to chuckle at when things start to get bad absolutely maybe watch it at home though if you have trouble stifling a giggle 
Dec 18 2018,positive, the biggest worry for me going into this film was would my suspension of disbelief hold out fantasy it may be and that should be all it requires to buy into its rules for the duration but would i be able to watch a city trundling around a dystopian landscape on gargantuan caterpillar tracks cannibalising other smaller cities and not keep thinking of monty pythons crimson permanent assurance i neednt have worried the highoctane opening showing a giant london on caterpillar tracks chasing a small bavarian mining village was presented with such straightforward sense of adventure and desperation that the snickers soon left though now and again i did find myself thinking of what mad max might be like if it had been directed by terry gilliam mortal engines based on the first of a series of books by phillip french belongs firmly to the steam punk genre where oldschool victorian values blend with scifi subject matter normally set in alternative worlds mortal engines is set in a far future after the sixty minute war laid waste to the world and a new order of scavenging evolved where travelling cities known as traction cities traverse the landscape living out of what they find left over from the past  we enter this world as it is on the verge of collapse conflict has risen between the traction cities notably london and those that have begun to resettle properly on the land in a place not unlike the mythological shangrila following a path of revenge against this backdrop is hester hera hilmar who aims to kill thaddeus valentine hugo weaving an ambitious leader of the traction city of london an unsuccessful attempt brings her to the attention of tom natsworty robert sheehan a young assistant in the city museum who in turn realises that valentine is not the great man he thought he was when he ejects him from the city because he knows the truth of hesters mission soon the two are in the wasteland making their way to god knows where while hugo is reaching the completion of his master plan as would be expected of any film that has peter jacksons writer producer moniker attached to it this is a sumptuous affair beautifully realised in design and costume and featuring some dazzling effects  he may not have his name attached as director but it is obvious that his influence on the director christian rivers is significant a lot of jacksons hallmark shots are up on the screen in this production it is unfortunate that the frenetic style that opens the film is maintained for the entire narrative characters are introduced at high speed and given no proper emotional weight barring one or two of them no one seems to really stop to take a breath though some sleep is had along the way most surprising is that the writing from peter jackson and his wife fran walsh seems so formulaic and predictable this may be because of the source material i couldnt truly say but even so from what i have learned of the books the wealth of background detail that went into realising the world of the story in the novels is certainly not given enough credence here the overarching plot stifles any characterisation from properly emerging the characters for the most part serve their functions rather than have any real sense of an inner life as the narrative and action escalates it finally descends into a sort of steampunk version of star wars despite those negatives there is a lot of joy to be had from this epic adventure if spectacle is what you are after you will find plenty even if it does go on a tad too long at a time when most blockbusters are so busy setting up their sequels it is refreshing that this film though possibly hoping to be the first of a series stands on its own as a narrative
Dec 18 2018,negative,   new zealander christian rivers always had a love for movies growing up and in an attempt to break into the industry the 17yearold sent a bunch of drawings into peter jackson in the early 1990s with hopes of landing a job  it worked  rivers was hired as a storyboard artist for the zombie comedy braindead released back in 1992 and since then he has been a part of every peter jackson directed film in a number of capacities  he even won an oscar in 2006 as a visual effects artist on king kong decades of experience have led rivers to this moment  an opportunity to sit in the directors chair and pull the strings on his first feature film  theres a lot at stake too  fans of philip reeves bestselling 2001 novel will be curious to see how it has been condensed and adapted for the big screen  investors will be nervous given the 100 million budget and the largely unknown cast  the future of this new franchise will most likely be determined by the early boxoffice this will sound like a backhanded compliment probably because it is but the films most interesting element is the world in which its set  the human race was all but obliterated in the early 22nd century when the earths crust shattered during the sixty minute war  mortal engines is set another 1600 years after that cataclysmic event where technology has regressed it was all lost during the war and humans have created a very different way of living in rebuilding the world from scratch leaders got creative  highrise cities such as london were set on wheels so they could move about the world in search of food water and energy  it sounds practical but theres also a more sinister element  large predatory cities attack smaller ones and the citizens watch with amusement as if its some kind of sport  this is illustrated in an actionpacked opening sequence which to the backdrop of a pulsating film score from antonius holkenborg creates a cool mad max fury road type vibe if only the story had the same level of creativity and originality  instead weve got some characters repeatedly throwing up cheesy lines and others providing obvious spoilers as to their fate if i should die  perhaps the narrative could have been saved by a charismatic thoughtprovoking villain but again thats lacking here  australian hugo weaving the matrix plays thaddeus valentine the quasimayor of a giant city who seems to be driven by power and nothing else  theres no subtlety to the character nor any reason to appreciate his point of view  i dont even know why people fight alongside him the team of good guys are headlined by icelandic actress hera hilmar an ordinary man and irishborn robert sheehan misfits  they play two stereotypical heroes hester and tom who are tasked with the responsibility of removing thaddeus from power  they also develop a romantic connection which ticks off another genre in addition to action comedy drama and scifi  the only appealing character in the mix is a greeneyed robot named shrike played by stephen lang who unlike everyone else is tricky to read and keeps you guessing
Dec 18 2018,negative, as a battle rages in london over whether britain should withdraw from the european union the scifi epic mortal engines offers the opposite scenario  london on wheels rolling across europe and ingesting smaller cities mortal engines is another postapocalypse from another series of ya novels this time by philip reeve though this one is distinguished by the sparenoexpense budget needed to build its imaginative detailed and mostly unique world designed with steampunk motifs suited to the idea of a scavenger society assembling a new world from spare parts of the old the film is directed by christian rivers special effects coordinator for peter jackson on the lord of the rings and hobbit movies jackson philippa boyens and fran walsh provide the script those franchises relied increasingly on special effects as they matured  often favoring digital spectacle over story and character  and that emphasis is certainly in evidence here rivers vision is something to see  i was particularly impressed with the flying machines that turn up midway through powered by ospreystyle tilting engines steered by fins and sails that suggest flying fish and sailing ships yet while the movie is often dazzling its also frequently dull there is an inert human story at its core centered on a young woman named hester hera hilmar with a lethal grudge against the sinister leader hugo weaving of the marauding metropolis city of london she starts out as his prisoner then his prey  on the run from the rolling city roving the dangerous wasteland accompanied by a london outcast named tom robert sheehan wearing a british invasion band outfit and a mod moptop to match toms a bit of a stumblebum and hester saves him more than once but she notices that hes earnestly taken with her and stands by her when he has a chance to bolt something that resonates with her past id like to say that sparks fly but the chemistry between these two actors is nonexistent hurt by some bad dialogue and its a big problem for mortal engines a movie desperately short on emotion despite a bombastic score designed to cue them there is actually more depth of feeling between hester and shrike stephen lang the robot dispatched to killer her shrike is straight out of the terminator  the eyes glow green instead of red but he makes the same hydraulic whirring when he moves and his giant feet clomp with the same metalonmetal sound theres also a rebel leader jihae with matrix eyewear a flowing coat and a cool sidearm and while that seems like an affectionate homage other forms of borrowing are less excusable especially as they make the movie predictable the finale is pure star wars londononwheels essentially turns into a death star with a weapon that must be disabled before it destroys the stronghold of the rebel alliance airborne fighters swoop in dodging deck guns but at least the light sabers are absent
Dec 17 2018,negative, main message seems to be kill or be killed even good guys dont hesitate before blowing someone away the two main characters have destinies that they must fulfill but these too are based on destruction and death the characters are so flat that they barely register as characters let alone role models they spend most of the movie destroying things running trying to look cool frequent use of guns shooting missiles explosions characters die sometimes violently sharp bladesspikes and stabbingslicing moderate blood from wounds including bullet wounds bloodiness ramps up in final battle scary monsterrobot creature creepy imagery lots of chasingfallingcrashing punching reference to drinking own urine slave market shown people being sold to cannibals parents need to know that mortal engines is a scififantasy movie based on a young adult novel by philip reeve and adapted and produced by peter jackson among others big fans of the book andor steampunk enthusiasts may like it but others are likely to find it mechanical and derivative its too childish for most teens and too brutally violent for most children especially in the climactic battle theres frequent gun use and shooting plus explosions stabbing and slicing with blood characters die sometimes quite violently viewers can also expect to see a scary robotskeleton monster and plenty of other intense creepy images language is on the mild side but includes damn hell bastard etc theres an extremely tame romance between the main female and male characters they touch hands gaze into each others eyes and finally hug to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails in mortal engines its the distant future and the world has been ravaged cities are now giant roving vehicles that are constantly searching for food and fuel the biggest is london where thaddeus valentine hugo weaving is collecting old tech to build something in secret meanwhile a girl from the wastelands hester shaw hera hilmar makes her way onboard london and tries to kill valentine shes stopped by a historian named tom robert sheehan who works at the citys museum hester and tom are both dropped into the wastes where theyre rescued by a rebel pilot anna fang jihae unfortunately a resurrected monster stephen lang is after hester and valentines daughter katherine leila george discovers what her father is really up to can the good guys stop the villains in time simpleminded and mechanical this movie clumsily borrows from every scififantasy movie of the last 40 years smushing everything together with inept filmmaking and a total lack of logic or emotion based on a young adult novel by philip reeve and  shockingly  adapted by peter jackson philippa boyens and fran walsh mortal engines does have some cool costumes and production design but that only goes so far the rest is numbingly familiar the movie doesnt even seem to take any joy in its copying rather than paying homage to anything its a slavish soulless piece of work as if done by a computer cutandpaste application its not even any fun its certainly too childish for teen viewers  but its also too brutally violent for younger viewers the sloppily shot and hastily cut action sequences are piled on top of other scenes that dont stick to any kind of character logic or need everything that happens serves only the plot the dialogue is winceinducing and characters spend most of the movie either scowling trying to look cool or staring slackjawed at some impressive piece of scenery by the end it becomes painfully clear that most of the incessant stealing can be traced to the star wars movies mortal engines has the dubious honor of making even the worst entries in that series look accomplished and admirable families can talk about mortal engines violence how did it make you feel is it meant to be thrilling whats the impact of media violence on kids common sense medias unbiased ratings are created by expert reviewers and arent influenced by the products creators or by any of our funders affiliates or partners common sense is the nations leading nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of all kids and families by providing the trustworthy information education and independent voice they need to thrive in the 21st century
Dec 17 2018,negative,firsttime director but longtime specialeffects person christian rivers is too focused on technical wizardry and the result is headacheinducing chaos
Dec 17 2018,negative, i recently had the pleasure of visiting a friend of some means who had bought himself a new tesla ive never been in a tesla never really even seen one up close and he eagerly gave me a tour of it and my god the thing is a damn marvel of science and technology and engineering those people have thought of everything every detail every perk its interior is essentially controlled by what looks like a large tablet screen and other than a gear shifter and a turn signal thats the entirety of its dashboard and gauges it gives you everything conveniently at the push of a button its intuitive and intelligent and wholly fascinating to look at i will readily admit that it met my skepticism of the brand headon and blew past me and when we took it for a drive  not far just through his neighborhood to get some pizza for our kids  it was like being inside a smooth silent mechanical shark i say this not because im looking for a tesla endorsement or trying to get you to spend absurd amounts of money on a car but because the encounter kept popping into my mind as i watched mortal engines last night based on the novel of the same name by phillip reeves the novel is the first of four it takes place in a wild future where civilization as we know it was wiped out by our own hubris and arrogant use of a superweapon whats left is a steampunky society of cities and towns that are always moving rolling creakily on massive tracks and wheels throughout a barren landscape the smaller towns live in constant fear of being hunted for parts and resources by predator cities the largest and most dangerous of which is london londons chief engineer is valentine hugo weaving a seemingly kind but actually viciously ambitious man determined to resurrect the weapons of the past to further londons dominance hes challenged by hester hera hilmar a scarred orphan with a vendetta and tom robert sheehan a young museum curatorintraining who unwittingly stumbles into the whole affair and joins forces with hester along the way they encounter other rebellious allies including anna fang south korean singersongwriter jihae as they fight towards stopping valentine and much like that tesla mortal engines is absolutely beautiful to look at the film is stunning in its worldbuilding in its visual pizzazz in its intricate and almost delicate attention to detail from costume design to set design to engineering its a gorgeous wondrous and rather original new world for the big screen the steampunk genre has never really effectively made its way into films and this feels like the closest weve ever come the cities themselves giant rumbling monstrosities that defy all logic feel vibrant and alive the same can be said of the weird alien airships that anna fang and her comrades fly  no sail  through the skies  but this isnt a tesla this is someone who took the hollowedout shell of a tesla and stuck an 85 chevy celebrity inside because despite its gorgeous visuals mortal engines has little new to show you in terms of story it takes a little while to realize how much of it is simply cobbled together pirated bits from other better films and novels right down to its boy who always wanted to be a pilot having a hero moment where he flies into the heart of the machine to make that one perfect shot to save the day climax there are so many storytelling elements that are lazy shortcuts and of course shortcuts are necessary evil when adapting to film although truth be told the film changes too many things around for its purposes taking away some of the books charm but these are less shortcuts and more narrative leaps from a telescoped romance that never clicks to a series of utterly jawdropping coincidences mortal engines takes all the capital it accrued with its visuals and wastes it on its drab story everything is predictable and the characters never really engage you robert sheehans tom stumbles around stupidly through the first half never really earning the hero mantle hes essentially gifted by circumstance hilmars hester is pretty good though frankly the character would have worked better on her own rather than being bogged down with tom and his dull baggage what youll really be pining for is the story of anna fang clever funny fierce fighter pirate and pilot who speaks like an utter badass and obviously skipped school the day they taught the lessons on fear shes a relentlessly bad bitch and she needs her own something stat theres a lot of wasted potential in mortal engines and that will come frustratingly as no surprise when you see that peter jackson had his hands all over this production as producer and coscreenwriter much like in some of his lord of the rings work  most notably the wretched hobbit trilogy  he cant leave well enough alone and is determined to leave his own stamp on everything ultimately doing more harm than good mortal engines could have been a fine film and a serviceable jumping point for a new franchise featuring a unique and lovely new type of dystopia but theres no chance that this world goes any further this thing is doomed from the start its going to stumble through a crowded christmas season losing the race to better films ultimately to be relegated to the junkyard of missed opportunities
Dec 17 2018,positive, a bigbudget movie about a dystopian future in which mobile cities devour each other this risk somehow did not pan out at the box office and may be one of the last cautionary tales of its kind its essential that i set the scene for mortal engines considering not only its surprisingly convoluted dystopian story line but also the fact almost nobody went to see the film in its debut weekend  the opening set piece of mortal engines is an extension of the films first teaserwhich laid out the movies general premise of what if cities  movedas the predator city of london is practicing municipal darwinism that is a fancy way of saying the rule of law in this decrepit future is that big cities swallow small townsliterallyif theyre able to chase them down its survival of the fittest metropolis edition we watch as a small mining settlement tries its best to evade london heading toward a crevice that the giant city wouldnt be able to squeeze through unfortunately the jagged terrain isnt doing the settlement any favors as it keeps losing momentum and once london is close enough the city attaches its harpoonsa death blow prepare to ingest hugo weavings london leader thaddeus valentine shouts to his subordinates asi cant believe im typing thislondon opens its mechanical maw and indeed ingests an entire town once london closes its uh mouth the mortal engines title flashes on the screen in perhaps the wildest 15 minutes of a blockbuster movie this year mortal engines evangelized me to all of its ridiculous glory  while the rest of mortal engines fails to reach the highs of its lurid opening set piece there are a lot of intriguing elements at play thanks to the films particularly strange worldbuilding conceit taken from the eponymous philip reeve novel that serves as its source material you see a cataclysmic event called the sixty minute war destroyed civilization as we know it and the vestiges of old societies became mobile cities which could ingest smaller communities and use their resources and fuel to keep chugging along in this dystopian landscape not all of humanity turned to inflated mad max cosplay however an antitraction league was formed in what used to be asia protected by a giant border wall to ward off the chaos of the warring cities valentines nefarious plot revolves around gathering enough resources to build a nucleartype device like one used in the sixty minute war that could destroy that giant wall meanwhile the films protagonist hester shaw played by hera hilmar plans to assassinate valentine as revenge for killing her mother when hester was a little girl though she eventually gets pulled into the larger conflict between london and the antitraction league and finds that a key revelation from her past could save everyoneas these stories usually go  i could keep goingtheres also a subplot involving hester and a terminatorzombietype thing called shrike played by an unrecognizable stephen lang who helped raise her after her mother died there are cameos by the minionsyes those minions courtesy of a museum in london that collects relics of the 21st century but mostly because illumination entertainment is a subsidiary of universal picturesand nfl player michael bennett i guess hes a steampunk enthusiast mortal engines is truly absurd in an endearingly strange way  theres a confluence of factors involved in a movie bombing this badly it doesnt help that mortal engines was dropped in the middle of a chaotic december schedule competing against a wreckit ralph sequel a new spiderman movie and in a weeks time the new mary poppins film aquaman and the transformers spinoff bumblebee that kind of competition is particularly daunting for a film based on fairly unfamiliar ipthe first mortal engines novel the basis of the movie was published in 2001that needs to bridge the information gap the easiest thing that could be inferred from the trailers was the cities are moving now conceit which is certainly a fun idea but evidently not enough to convince moviegoers to seek it out in droves over the wellreviewed familiarity and nostalgia derived from a character like spiderman  box office bombs are unavoidable in moviemaking theres always going to be a handful of big swings each year that fail the generate the hype to match their enormous production costs last year it was projects like the dark tower king arthur legend of the sword and especially valerian and the city of a thousand planets which struggled to such an extent that it was primarily responsible for its production company shuttering within a year like valerian itself based on a european comic that didnt have a global mainstream appeal mortal engines was perhaps always destined to be a flop nowadays if a blockbuster isnt a gritty reboot a superhero film or a new star wars project it is increasingly difficult for that movie to be more than a sunk cost  the best time for mortal engines to thrive wouldve been when the fantasy genre peaked around the time of the original harry potter franchise and peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy jackson is a cowriter and executive producer for mortal engines there hasnt been an heir apparent to the fantasy blockbusterunless you count game of thrones gamechanging popularity on hbosince the last harry potter film came out in 2011 as superhero movies have completely taken over there have certainly been enough attempts at launching fantasy franchises in the following years the golden compass in 2007 ya dystopian fare like the maze runner and the divergent series and more recently the new fantastic beasts franchise which has yet to recapture the original harry potters magic  it doesnt mean that fantasy as a blockbuster genre is doomedagain look at thronesjust that the projects havent been able to match the lofty ambitions and production costs indeed while mortal engines traction cities and broader worldbuilding is undeniably original the worst thing about the movie is how transparently its narrative tries to imitate great material that came before it there are the obvious mad max undertones to that opening city chase scenethe sequence is even scored by the same composer as mad max fury road junkie xlbut also elements of the matrix in certain characters aesthetics and a derivative romantic subplot that all young adultleaning dystopian fare seems to lean toward one of the biggest twists in the film is taken directly from the original star wars trilogy and almost uses the dialogue verbatim  in other words mortal engines is at times an absolute blast to watch but its narrative pitfalls also make it clear that the world didnt just commit blasphemy and allow the true successor to lord of the rings to bomb at the box office there are enough entertaining moments in mortal engines to imagine it could gain a second life as a cult classici could watch that opening city chase scene at least two dozen more times on bluraymuch like valerian a flawed but admirably ambitious space epic should eventually find a larger more appreciative audience but perhaps this soft spot for flawed works like mortal engines and valerian is symptomatic of a larger cinematic trend they just dont make blockbusters like these with much frequency anymore if a few more expensive unfamiliar projects bomb like these two have such films may well go extinct and if that happens the film and others like it will be like the minions were in mortal engines relics of an earlier era in hollywood rachel and callie discuss the bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes then jodi hops on to talk the valley and vanderpump rules
Dec 17 2018,negative, on paper aquaman would appear to have so many things going for it dazzling underwater visual effects that pit seahorseborne armies against sharkmounted cavalry more trident fights than you can shake er a trident at and nicole kidman in a homemade lobster costume whats not to like well unfortunately for the latest instalment of the socalled dc extended universe of superheroes quite a lot the storytelling is all over the place its 140minute running time feels interminable and much of the acting is downright poor  mind you with lots of the dialogue delivered through a sort of blub blub blub filter to show its being delivered underwater even judi dench no of course shes not in it might struggle for dramatic impact with director james wan clearly aiming for the same sort of tongueincheek comic tone that has made thor such a popular character for dcs rival marvel it soon becomes clear that jason momoa the hawaiianborn hunk who plays aquaman is no chris hemsworth  at some moments momoa seems to have stumbled out of a shampoo commercial while at others he falls back on his own personal variation on the blue steel pout from the male model spoof zoolander after the 2017 triumph that was wonder woman the previous origins story in the dc series aquaman has to go down as a distinctly soggy disappointment so whats going on frankly too much first we have to get used to the idea that arthur curry aka aquaman when hes grownup who can breathe while submerged and is strong enough to toss a nuclear submarine out of the water is the product of a stormtossed union between a maine lighthousekeeper and the runaway queen of atlantis kidman channelling daryl hannah in splash  also the wicked king orm patrick wilson not only turns out to be arthurs halfbrother but announces his menacing plan to unite the seven underwater kingdoms possibly not peacefully which if ive got this even vaguely right would make him master of the oceans and give him the sort of marine military mandate to come after us surfacedwellers next whats he so cross with us about well judging by the battleships and garbage tossed on to our beaches in a huge poseidonlike tempest its the militarisation of the seas and our dumping of rubbish in the oceans in other words orm is doing bad things for good reasons which would explain why i was soon as confused as wilson often looks compared to wonder woman aquaman feels underpowered in every department except visual effects actingwise gal gadot the israeli actress who played the title character was less well known than momoa is now but not only did she emerge with great personal credit but she was cleverly and sensibly surrounded by actors who gave the production real substance  chris pine robin wright and danny huston to name but three aquaman by distinct contrast has amber heard in a red wig sparkly green jumpsuit and glowy eyes as the flighty but useful tohaveonyourside queen of the sea mera and thats about it oh and kidman in that lobster suit of course although hers is but a modest contribution yahya abdul mateen who plays mamba couldnt swim so kept it a secret while he learned  only to find his scenes would be cgi scriptwise wonder woman also comes out on top thanks to its sensitive and sophisticated handling of the first world war a highly emotive subject that could so easily have tripped it up the polluting of the oceans offers similar emotional potential for aquaman but its not realised partly because of the confused storytelling partly because it feels like its been lazily chucked in for easy topicality and partly because a lot of the time momoa makes arthur a rather charmless joker who seems keener on looking cool and trying to make us laugh often in vain than saving the planet but maybe hes keeping that for aquaman 2 listen out for a splendidly castagainsttype julie andrews as the voice of an ancient seamonster a rare moment of fun from wan perhaps best known for fast  furious 7  he imbues aquaman with a similar hyperkinetic energy and lack of subtlety demonstrating an impressive mastery of visual effects but surely misjudging the level of acceptable violence for a film clearly seeking a family audience produced by peter jackson and with a screenplay by the writing team behind the lord of the rings this spectacularlooking adaptation of philip reeves 2001 fantasy novel should be one of the highlights of the festive cinema season but it falls horribly flat hampered by duff casting a clumsily structured screenplay and too many reminders of star wars somewhere theres the story of young rebel hester shaw hera hilmar right wanting to kill londons scheming headhoncho thaddeus valentine hugo weaving but it all gets lost in a way that means that if you didnt know visualeffects expert christian rivers was directing his first feature film you could probably guess nothing to do with the latest films with tom holland as peter parker this is a superbly animated picture that takes spiderman right back to his comicbook origins which it does by positing the idea that every alternate universe has its own spiderman or does until a huge machine built by the sinister kingpin blows a hole in the spacetime continuum universes collide and all sorts of versions of the character arrive in the same place the end result should delight diehard fans but at almost two hours will test less devoted admirers after disobedience comes another tale of illicit lesbian love only this one is based on a true story that unfolds in the massachusetts of 1892 and involves a double murder chlo√´ sevigny and kristen stewart star in a drama that proves slow and austere until the bloodspattered last lap told through the eyes of sadistic misogynistic serial killer jack matt dillon this is a clever shocking and darkly funny horror movie  until danish filmmaker lars von trier eventually goes too far for mainstream audiences as he nearly always does 
Dec 17 2018,neutral, the postapocalyptic young adult fantasy flick mortal engines rolls into and out of ones consciousness like traction cities that roam its landscape there are so many aviation goggles and large gears grinding that its basically steampunk the movie it starts out at a very high level of steampunk then manages to go up even from there weve got old tech and waistcoats aplenty hot air balloon cities galore bowlerhatted royal guards weve got 20 but who cares no big deal theres a whole lot more the lord of the rings team of peter jackson  fran walsh and philippa boyens have tackled philip reeves 2001 book of the same name with director christian rivers making his directorial debut theres not much setup for the dystopian future except there was a sixty minute war the earths crust was somehow shattered into thousands of pieces thanks to some kind of nucleartype weapon called a medusa and now all the cities and towns of the world sit atop giant tractor treads traveling around and eating other smaller towns for resources as their citizens hoot and cheer mortal engines asks you to just go with it so yeah well just go with it rivers has been working in the art and visual effects departments with jackson and co since dead alive in 1992 and his sense of visual acumen is extraordinarily imaginative and huge in scope the designs of the cities and their inner workings are remarkable with a sense of industrial beauty london a big brutish thing with st pauls cathedral sitting on top like a little hat motors hither and yon munching up tiny bavarian mining villages while its dapper residents maintain museums filled with artifacts of the ancient times like toasters and smartphones puckish museum assistant tom robert sheehan has his world thrown topsyturvy literally when hes tossed into a giant waste tube with hester hera hilmar a mysterious girl she makes a dramatic attempt on the life of thaddeus valentine hugo weaving londons most powerful energy tycoon tom whos never been off london is caught up in hesters quest for vengeance as well as her escape from a killer robot skeleton named strike the pair are scooped up by antitraction activist anna fang jihae and enlisted into the resistance housed in a city in the sky made up of biplanes balloons and rickety scaffolding the sheer size and beauty of mortal engines is transporting even the predatory london is hightech and welldressed and annas crimson plane seemingly crafted from wood and paper is jawdropping there is so much thats pleasing to look at from the costumes to the characters to the sets and landscape its hard to imagine the execution with a nearseamless blend of practical sets and computergenerated spectacle one just wishes the same level craft went into the characters and script theres not a lot of stake in the outcomes of any of the characters and the script is laden with clich√©d old chestnuts that start to get as rusty as the crunchy engines the only real lessons seem to be dont do war and robots have feelings too a strange tangent visually its busy hefty and propulsive but emotionally and thematically its as light as air these engines could have used a bit more in the tank
Dec 17 2018,positive, the world has been forever broken after an apocalyptic event cities uprooted and placed on wheels to traverse what remains while trying to be the dominant force and survive hugo weaving is a villain again bent on conquering whatever gets in his way and peter jackson is yet again attached to a visually impressive and lengthy film throw in a few references to a certain classic scifi film saga and you have mortal engines the film which is based on the phillip reeve novel from 2001 of the same name doesnt pull any punches in its first act some novel adaptations give the audience a chance to wade into the story while slowly giving them key bits of information that will come in handy later on mortal engines decides that either youve read the novel and know all the information already or you dont and youre about to have a confusing half hour of character introductions and history that you wont fully comprehend until youre leaving the theater the story begins with a mysterious young woman named hester shaw aboard a small city that is being hunted by the massive city of london the exciting chase ends as london captures the smaller city and takes aboard all of the citizens residing on it as these new members of london are boarded onto the vessel we are introduced to thaddeus valentine weaving who seems to be the most important and intelligent man in london we then are introduced to several characters each providing increasingly important plot details about what led to the world crumbling and turning into this mad max like state after an assassination attempt by shaw on valentine goes horribly wrong shaw and a young history fanatic named tom are ejected from the city and thrust into the wastelands left behind everything that happens in this first section of the story although it may be a lot to take in at the time is explained throughout the rest of the film on their journey to expose the growing issue that is london hester and tom meet new allies troubling old acquaintances and important figures who possess knowledge of the past there is so much more to this story which made the slightly over twohour runtime feel packed with excitement and information this film adaptation of a young adult novel did something that most fail to do make a hollywood action movie feel like youre reading a dense book whether this was a good thing or not is a different story entirely hera hilmar gives a strong and impressive performance as the lead in the film hugo weaving yet again delivers as a suave villain that audiences will be rooting against from the moment the film starts but the breakout stars in the film are robert sheehan if you havent seen the show misfits go watch it now who played tom and jihae who played the badass anna fang of all the characters in the film jihae was infinitely entertaining and couldve carried her own film peter jacksons touch is distinct throughout despite not sitting in the directors chair having produced and cowrite the screenplay the massive scale and eyepopping visuals that jackson is known for are apparent from the very first scene to the final shot although it is primarily a special effects driven film oftentimes rough around the edges there were a surprising amount of practical sets that looked fantastic the film was directed by christian rivers someone who worked in the art department for several of jacksons films including the lord of the rings and the hobbit trilogies the combination of jackson and rivers in mortal engines showed off the pairs attention to detail and love of epic landscapes the biggest aspect of the film that felt the most out of place was its excessive need to throw strange nods and winks at the audience the story takes place in the distant future after the world and civilization have ended the characters in the film find and collect relics from the past and use them to crack jokes about the past our current time theres mentions of smartphones junk food and the internet that for the most part are glaringly obvious and juvenile mortal engines is for the most part exactly what it looks like from the marketing it has crazy visuals epic battle scenes an impressively massive scale and a mostly predictable story while trying to get as much character and history information out as possible the film struggles at times to find its focus regardless the beautiful scenery and extended action sequences left little room for boredom and made for an entertaining ride tyler considers himself to be a true lover of movies and the magic that goes into making them he spends most of his free time watching and absorbing film and television from a very young age film was an escape and an adventure that tyler could never get enough of throughout his high school years he had the honor of working on an award winning independent short film hosting a film reviewing segment on a public access station working at two movie theaters and attending a film festival as a young journalist for his cousins local paper he is the one person that would never turn down going to a theater or staying home and watching a movie and talking about it immediately after tylers goal in life is to one day be one of the great writers and directors of the entertainment industry like his hero steven spielberg
Dec 17 2018,negative, christian riverss film is based on the first in a quartet of youngadult novels by philip reeve they are driven by a potent conceit on our ruined earth in the far future most cities are on the move london for instance plows across europe on caterpillar tracks chewing up smaller towns in its path unfortunately what felt so ominous on the page ends up onscreen looking implausible and sounding merely noisy nor are the characters much more engaginga shame and a surprise given that peter jackson is one of the producers a comely youth named tom robert sheehan teams up with hester shaw hera hilmar a scarred young woman bent on private vengeance their enemy is thaddeus valentine hugo weaving who is developing a weapon so secret that he houses it in the dome of st pauls cathedral the stakes are enormous but the outcome is neither here nor there in wide release
Dec 16 2018,negative, mortal engines or the peter jackson steampunk movie as ive been calling it adapts the first in philip reeves fourpart ya fantasy series first published in 2001 produced by jackson and directed by frequent collaborator christian reeves its set in a distant dystopian future and goofily imagines the geography of planet earth rearranged with mobile predator cities such as london feasting on rural towns and villages howls moving castle seems a reference point here londons captain thaddeus valentine hugo weaving is covertly building a nuclear weapon inside st pauls cathedral orphaned bandit hester shaw hera hilmar seeks valentine for personal revenge aided by historian tom natsworthy robert sheehan curls mercilessly straightened and sunglasseswearing outlaw anna fang korean popstar jihae hester in turn is hunted by an undead robot named shrike stephen lang the films critiques are unimaginative tutting at how territories attack first in order to consolidate power as well as the spectacle of war itself bystanders crowding the balconies of the shiplike city shrieking as guns and lasers fire at the wastelands below
Dec 16 2018,neutral, lets be honest since the first trailers started to emerge mortal engines has seemed to be a film that the studio had no idea how to sell to audiences based on the book series by philip reeve with a screenplay adapted by lord of the rings authors peter jackson philippa boyens and fran walsh  it has suffered from mixed messaging about what kind of film it was and what audience age grouping it was going for  as it turns out thats unfortunate because it is an impressive piece of worldbuilding and it hits more often than it misses set 1000ish years after a worldwide nuclear war has ravaged and broken the earth the remaining cities have evolved into traction cities  gigantic selfmobile cities which are practicing a municipal darwinism by hunting down smaller cities and destroying them and taking their resources and labor forces so its really a large part of the mad max fury road concept just rather than war rigs and cars its london yes really londinium itself which is rolling along its citizens lining the edges of observation decks while it runs to ground a small bavarian mining town grinding it into consumable scrap harvesting old tech from it and absorbing its workforce no the vast size and scope of the cities makes no logical sense but then this should be remembered its a fantasy in the same way that audiences flocked to stardust or even lord of the rings its purely a fantasy world and plays very much by its own rules the acting is fine the huge action set pieces are good and youve never really known you needed to see what two cities chasing each other around a broken landscape until now because its actually really pretty fun clocking in just over the two hours mark the film suffers perhaps more than most in recent memory  it should have either been about 2025 minutes shorter or doubledown and be a limited series the world is one that feels like its been developed and the mythos almost gets in the way of things with only a few hours to deliver the story the last 30 minutes does wind up heading dangerously close to cw networklevels of melodrama and interpersonal connections and could have used another editing pass science fiction is too often relegated to being a 2nd class citizen amongst the genre world and everything seems like its a rehash sure even if engines isnt one to crow about being a sciencebased film thats fine it doesnt have to be genre fandoms are already entirely over the moon for anything to do with harry potter and theres nothing to be found in engines which is more outlandish or harder to accept than is running around hogwarts on a daily basis relax its fine and i would love to see it get a good box office run domestically or internationally mortal engines is directed by christian rivers and stars hera hilmar robert sheehan hugo weaving jihae leila george ronan raftery patrick malahide and stephan lang it runs for two hours and eight minutes and is rated pg13
Dec 16 2018,positive,    few films in recent memory have demanded a big screen as much as this highfantasy adaptation it compensates for a fairly generic hero story beating at its heart by giving us good mythologising and just being the biggest in the room     humanity has all but completely fallen thanks to the sixty minute war in which a series of quantum bombs were set off that left the world a wasteland where resources are scarce to survive and assert dominance humankind came up with the idea of making the worlds great cities into mobile machines that traverse the land in perpetual war with one another the larger cities absorb smaller surrounding communities whose onboard societies live hearing stories of and scavenging old tech iphones computers toasters from a time gone by     our hero is an enigmatic young woman named hester hera hilmar she boards the almighty london to exact revenge against leader thaddeus valentine hugo weaving whom she blames for the death of her mother there she meets wideeyed tom robert sheehan and after they are forced into the wilderness band together in a larger fight the idea of mechanised cities roaming the earth is a bold concept indeed and it takes some time to convince however it gets there thanks to a nice tangible sense of worldbuilding despite its cgiheavy aesthetic and an eyepopping epic scale     the films greatest strength is the sheer size of it these humongous mechanical cities with evermoving parts and on groundshaking wheels are a sight to behold its a spectacle that does a lot of the heavylifting so to speak as the quest that propels the story forward leans on the familiar and doesnt have a great deal of chemistry to speak of between the two leads sheehan has a fairly thankless putupon role compared to hilmars more actionpacked one     directed by firsttimer christian rivers  a former storyboard artist talent nurtured by the films longtime developing producercowriter peter jackson  it also works solidly on its own terms as an escapist yarn propped up by an imaginative and intriguing mythology that feels livedin and believable as far as these things go     it has flaws to spare not least an overreliance on a pedestrian hero arc bolted on to a quite standard adventure story but its fairly rewarding in its sense of immersion in a welldesigned world of towering scale that reminds us why the big screen is referred to as such     we know there are thousands of national readers who want to debate argue and go back and forth in the comments section of our stories weve got the most informed readers in scotland asking each other the big questions about the future of our country     unfortunately though these important debates are being spoiled by a vocal minority of trolls who arent really interested in the issues try to derail the conversations register under fake names and post vile abuse     so thats why weve decided to make the ability to comment only available to our paying subscribers that way all the trolls who post abuse on our website will have to pay if they want to join the debate  and risk a permanent ban from the account that they subscribe with     the conversation will go back to what it should be about  people who care passionately about the issues but disagree constructively on what we should do about them lets get that debate started

Dec 15 2018,negative,then were introduced to the most fearsome mechanism of all the groaning monstrosity known as the script
Dec 15 2018,negative,even a rather nifty resurrected warrior stephen lang cant save this cumbersome steampunk telling of a powerful london on wheels devouring the rest of europe and beyond
Dec 15 2018,negative, steampunk is a fascinating subculture that centres on the convergence of early mechanics and science fiction existing in worlds that either are based in or have devolved to the past these societies are simultaneously progressive and backwards the machines they control are often aweinspiring but civilization has taken several steps back towards the dark ages and preconnectivity still deep rich colours occupy the frame and devotion or knowledge of the old ways absorbs the characters time as they hope to better understand their unsophisticated ancestors mortal engines is based in this world but someone is combing the past for a more dangerous purpose tom natsworthy robert sheehan lives on a mobile london as almost all cities now exist on wheels moving over connected land masses in search of sparse resources he works at a museum dedicated to relics of the past where he encounters fellow history buff katherine valentine leila george her father thaddeus hugo weaving is head of a secret project expected to save their scarcely surviving city when hester shaw hera hilmar infiltrates london she exposes a secret thaddeus does everything to sweep back under the rug expelled from the metropolis hester shows tom the world beyond the safety of his home young adult fiction typically weaves fantastical tales with young people at its centre and an adult at the helm of a potential disaster the problem with this genre is what works in writing doesnt always translate well to film adaptations seeing their epic settings on the screen  particularly the giant machines in motion  is impressive but the desire to be faithful to the narrative often results in drawn out stories that bores all except the devoted fan the minute details that give the written word realism and vibrancy can seem clunky and superfluous in the bigscreen version when the world is burning and time is of the essence someone stopping to admire a rack of jackets before choosing the perfect one seems impractical it also says a lot when the most compelling characters are in supporting roles such as anna fang jihae and her kickass fighting skills and shrikes stephen lang otherworldly intimidating presence with peter jackson and members of the production team from the lord of the rings and the hobbit film series working behind the scenes this movie had potential visually it delivers on that promise as the unique mobile cities are undeniably striking from the giant metropolis housing thousands to the smaller nomadic markets to the insectlike vehicle built for two they also take to the air with makeshift planes and floating safe havens but at 128 minutes theres too much wasted time if it was tighter and focused on hitting the obvious beats to propel the story forward itd be a muchimproved picture but as it stands it dillydallies through an already predictable narrative to deliver an awkwardly worded and underwhelming conclusion  copyright  1998  2023 digital journal inc sitemaps xml  news  digital journal is not responsible for the content of external sites read more about our external linking 
Dec 15 2018,negative,i dont think the spectacle is enough
Dec 14 2018,neutral,given the script they were working with i didnt hate the movie and i didnt think it was an awful watch you can get through it ok
Dec 14 2018,negative,it just was so boring and dull and it turned one of my favorite actors into a onenote blah
Dec 14 2018,positive,mortal engines is a fullpowered thoughtprovoking drama it does become melodramatic at times but that too could be an accurate representation of the future
Dec 14 2018,negative,mortal engines is the sort of movie that you watch when you get home from a rave at 3 am and youre still too high or amped up to go to sleep
Dec 14 2018,negative, sometime in the notsodistant future humanity is on the brink of extinction a cataclysmic event led to a worldwide conflict that devastated the planet people retreat to movable cities of varying scales most of them small barely more than a few homes shops and refineries of one sort or another but the larger ones the more massive of these mechanical beasts they may house countless thousands while also containing the remnants of civilizations that otherwise would have been lost to the sands of time they feed on the smaller vehicles utilizing them for fuel while also forcing their former inhabitants to join their society whether they wish to or not the most lethal of these movable metropolises is london currently it is marauding across the remains of europe esteemed archeologist and revered city planner thaddeus valentine hugo weaving mysteriously looking for ancient technological artifacts under the guise of trying to construct a machine capable of powering the city without having to fuel its furnaces with scrap metal and other combustible odds and ends in reality he wants to rebuild a weapon capable of opening up resourcefilled strongholds protected be massive shield walls no movable city has ever been able to penetrate valentine wants to utilize the same sort of device the ancients unleashed that titled the world to the edge of apocalypse trusting that the citizens of london will either be too stupid too greedy or too timid to realize what hes about to do is nothing short of evil based upon the bestselling series of science fictionadventures by author philip reeve if nothing else mortal engines boasts one of the most eyepopping adrenalinefilled opening sequences of any movie ive seen in 2018 the directorial debut for veteran king kong and the hobbit trilogy special effects artist christian rivers this introductory sequence setting up the primary characters the world they live in and the gigantic moveable cities on which so much of humanity now lives is something else its a freewheeling expertly realized visual extravaganza i was glued to my seat eager to discover where reeve and academy awardwinning screenwriters fran walsh philippa boyens and peter jackson the lord of the rings trilogy were going to take things next the energetically cohesive way in which they set the stage for all the action to come nothing short of thrilling which is exactly why i ended up finding this particular feature to be so frustratingly disappointing theres so much to love so much that held me spellbound the fact im sitting here annoyed that the whole thing never works nearly as well as it by all accounts early on looks as if it is going to has me lingering in a state perilously close to anger while the story owes a great deal to everything ranging from flash gordon to japanese anime to the hunger games to  surprise surprise  star wars isnt much of a shock that walsh boyens and jackson seem to be having such a devil of a time juggling all of the various narrative strands considering their success with the lord of the rings undeniably is key characters are introduced do something interesting and then subsequently disappear for large chunks of the story only to be reintroduced at random moments worse the climax feels hurried haphazardly put together and oddly unfocused nothing holds together in an emotionally satisfying way and by the time a few surviving heroes quite literally flew off into the sunset i was honestly flummoxed as to why i was supposed to have cared about anything that just happened throughout the course of this 128minute endeavor but gosh darn do i want to care the way rivers introduces all his primary characters during that opening sequence most notably valentine his whipsmart daughter katherine leila george and erstwhile historian and wannabe pilot tom natsworthy robert sheehan while also juggling a humongous action sequence that has to explain the nature of these movable cities while at the same time showcase what they can and cannot do all of that is handled with exhilarating confidence best of all is the way in which the filmmaker showcases the storys primary heroine the red scarf clad firebrand hester shaw hera hilmar rivers immediately cements her as this films most iconic personality giving just enough information about hester in these initial moments to enflame my curiosity and get me genuinely excited to discover why she and valentine are instant enemies right from the first second they entered into one anothers company so why do some of these characters most notably katherine just up and vanish for long stretches only to reappear at random moments to either help fill in some of the expository holes or do something important when no one else is apparently available to do so why is a key subplot involving hester and a robotic formerly human bounty hunter named shrike a phenomenal stephen lang the most emotional one in the entire film even though theres another plot strand involving the young woman and her growing infatuation with tom to contend with as well why does the climactic battle between the city of london and a ragtag group of aerial pirates led by the enigmatic anna fang jihae feel rushed confusingly edited and sloppily assembled when everything else up to that point has been so visually resplendent and narratively coherent these are just some of the issues i had as mortal engines roared towards its conclusion it felt like large chunks were taken out of the film almost as if someone ordered rivers jackson and the rest of the creative team to whittle things down as close to a twohour running time as possible as interesting as this world is and as spectacularly realized as much of it might be at a certain point all of the missteps cant help but take an almost catastrophic toll while my eightyearold self was thrilling to a lot of what was happening as magnetic and as empowering a pair of heroines hester and anna end up proving to be both hilmar and jihae deliver dynamically compelling performances i still couldnt get past just how increasingly absurd and disconnected everything became by the time the key faceoff the entire story had been building towards finally came to pass even that turned out to be something of a disheartening letdown and a moment that should have had me wanting to rise to my feet and cheer instead had me slumping nearer to the floor letting out an inaudible groan look im still impressed by much of what rivers is able to accomplish this is an intriguing world and the surviving characters are all ones id not be against following on another adventure if it were ever to happen also just from a technical standpoint the visual effects sound design costumes and production design are some of the best ive seen this year and had this film screened for press earlier in the month id ive voted for all of them for awards consideration in the various critic organizations im privileged to be a part of is it enough for me to give mortal engines a recommendation no no it is not but that doesnt mean theres still not plenty to love and if my eightyearold self has its way that might be enough to give this scifi spectacle a second chance sooner rather than later we are dedicated to creating a distinguished user experience and a website rich in content with

Dec 14 2018,positive,  when it comes to fantasy and soft science fiction the concept of world building is at least as important as narrative and character development world building refers to the ability of an author or filmmaker to craft a new and amazing vista in which hisher story can transpire using every available tool to achieve the aim of making the setting believable and lived in rather than pedestrian and forgettable mortal engines the movie adaptation of philip reeves ya novel represents one of the most impressive examples of world building in recent years surpassing such contenders as valerian cloud atlas and even the recent star wars episodes  blessed with a wellpaced although sometimes too frenetic story that has a beginning middle and end mortal engines might have been wellplaced to start a new franchise had outside factors not conspired against it one of the common gripes with movies like this  that they sacrifice the single movie story concept in order to facilitate a multipart arc that more often than not is never given the opportunity to play out as fans of divergent will attest  doesnt apply here screenwriters peter jackson philippa boyens and fran walsh who are no strangers to movie series ensure that mortal engines remains selfcontained while still allowing for the possibility of future installments reeve wrote a fourbook set with these characters unfortunately the collapse of the ya motion picture market coupled with universals decision not to aggressively publicize mortal engines has allbutassured that this will be a oneanddone affair and while i would enjoy seeing more adventures with these characters i left the theater satisfied with the story i had seen and the world building that brings it to life the time frame is perhaps 1000 years in the future as a result of a cataclysmic 60minute war that laid waste to the planet a steampunk postapocalyptic future has arisen in which huge mobile cities roam the barren landscape looking for smaller settlements to devour the movie opens with a special effects bonanza as the greatest of all the cities london commanded by mayor magnus crome patrick malahide chases down the mining settlement of salzhaken shortly thereafter one of the refugees from salzhaken a young woman named hester shaw hera hilmar attempts to assassinate the head of the guild of historians thaddeus valentine hugo weaving the attack is foiled by one of valentines apprentices tom natsworthy robert sheehan who chases hester through the burning wreckage of salzhaken as london consumes it for energy the chase ends with both hester and tom being ejected from the ship when valentine reveals himself not to be the genial unassuming man he seems to be out in the great hunting ground hester and tom face a number of challenges not the least of which is learning to trust one another they join forces with antitraction league agent anna fang jihae in an attempt to stop valentine before he is able to make a deathweapon active and hester becomes the focal point of a hunt by the undead stalker shrike stephen lang who claims she has broken a promise if mortal engines seems at times like star wars its not a coincidence but thats not because reeve and the screenwriters were overly influenced by george lucas movies although it would be na√Øve to assume theres not some of that but because as has often been discussed when analyzing lucas storytelling common tropes and mythologies form the basis not only of star wars but many epic stories the films look shaped under the direction of fisttime director and jackson prot√©g√© christian rivers draws on various familiar steampunk sources from mad max to the city of lost children to a few of terry gilliams adventures while maintaining its own identity the special effects are indeed special and deserve to be seen on a big screen the bigger the better this is one of those rare films when walltowall cgi doesnt result in an overdose  for the lead the filmmakers went with icelandic actress hera himlar who has quietly assembled an impressive albeit lowkey resume in recent years she conveys hesters strength isolation and vulnerability and generates some slowburn chemistry with robert sheehans bumbling tom sheehan like himlar is a relatively fresh face although this isnt his first flirtation with ya movies he previously appeared in the illfated city of bones the bestknown actor in mortal engines is also the one with the most screen presence hugo weaving who infuses the villainous valentine with a charismatic streak that refuses to be ignored weaving who has a longstanding relationship with jackson he portrayed elrond in the middle earth movies makes valentine likable enough that he seems more like an antihero than a traditional bad guy one could envision a different version of this movie from his perspective its increasingly rare that new properties are accorded this sort of big splashy treatment in todays climate nearly every spectacle is either a sequel or a remake mortal engines isnt revolutionary nor does it color outside the lines in terms of its narrative or character interaction but it succeeds in telling an engaging tale with sufficient flare and drive that it never threatens to overstay its welcome as shepherded by filmmakers with a penchant for visual storytelling mortal engines is two hours wellspent
Dec 14 2018,negative, the notion of cities on tank treads rolling around and ingesting the landscape in front of them could function as an apt metaphor for the excesses of the hollywood franchise machine endless appetite coupled with voracious recycling so it should surprise no one that mortal engines is such a beast itself though based on a 2001 novel by philip reeve this mad max steampunk affair gradually steals more and more shots lines props wardrobe and plot points from the first star wars trilogy until youre prepared for someone to draw a lightsaber or head to mos eisley the film is a peter jackson production cowritten by jackson and partners fran walsh and philippa boyd and directed by hobbit secondunit helmer christian rivers set a thousand years after something called the sixty minute war devastated civilization and presumably sunday night tv ratings it features a wheeled city of london rampaging across europe thaddeus valentine hugo weaving is at the helm but is almost killed by hester shaw hera hilmar whom he once knew and left with a nasty scar and a tragic backstory she escapes accompanied by citydweller tom natsworthy robert sheehan who gradually learns that london isnt all its cracked up to be among other things thaddeus is trying to resurrect ancient technology to make his city the fittest player in this game of municipal darwinism hester is also being chased by shrike an undead robot that you could build yourself with bits of bill nighy a terminator and some green christmas lights but she has a friend in the mysterious anna fang played by ethereal korean singersongwriter jihae anna flies her airship  i swear it was called the jenny agutter but google assures me its jenny haniver  to airhaven a huge floating city that looks like a special effect waiting to happen the film is gorgeous to look at particularly in the earlygoing before you start playing spotthestarwars reference at least 18 million of its 100million budget must have gone toward bricabrac and it would have been amazing to see what a visual director like terry gilliam could have done with this overstuffed tale alas rivers plays it safe the bythenumbers script backed by takeyoubythehand editing and a style of shooting im going to call cinematobvious no memory can be recalled without an extended flashback usually ending with a return to the character now sporting an artful tear on his or her cheek the title by the way comes from a line from shakespeares othello im just glad the filmmakers didnt get their hands on dickens i would not want to see a tale of two cities viewed through this fractured lens this website uses cookies to personalize your content including ads and allows us to analyze our traffic read more about cookies here by continuing to use our site you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy
Dec 14 2018,negative,this tale  is a homemade quilt of repurposed story beats no character in this film will do something you havent seen a very similar character do in the past
Dec 14 2018,positive, only the latest dystopian yarn mortal engines cant help but pilfer in the third act lets give the filmmakers points for good taste the finale steals from that star wars climax in ways both huge and small the story opens with a bang the kind that suggest a new classic is in progress those hopes are dashes as soon as the rolling tank known as london comes to a halt were roughly a 1000 years in the future long after the sixty minute war rendered the earth uninhabitable so the remaining humans made their cities portable via massive gears wheels and machinery that sparks the phenomenal opening a set piece delivering thrills imaginative visuals and a wonderful sense of scale theres no followup sequence thats equal to it whats worse the longer mortal engines rolls on the less intelligent it comes mortal engines reflects hollywoods woke sensibilities but it doesnt stop the story cold tom is depicted as a wellintentioned fool hes even called an idiot at one point hester by comparison is flawless in her fury the screen still comes alive whenever anna fang appears jihae plays anna a tough as nails hero with a murky backstory shes tough and inscrutable and jihae pulls it off without posing the most human character in the story a zombie robot named shrike voiced by stephen lang thats a bad sign given the crush of actual humans in the cast still shrike is so arresting it becomes less a flaw than a selling point the third act goes by in a blur select moments may make you cheer but its so frenzied and loud that the impact is duller than you expect youll spot the star wars nods right away but youll miss that films elegant storytelling hilmar and sheehan have chemistry all right but the screenplay cant make the most of it weaving can do villainy by default so theres little problem with his gravitas quotient the movie toys with interesting notions but quickly discards them why are the londoners so bloodthirsty is the quest for salt all that important are there other threats to londons traction city mortal engines based on a young adult novel discourages deeper thought thats a shame given its dystopian roots half their fun is teasing out their cockeyed scenarios
Dec 14 2018,positive, copyright universal 2018well it looks amazing producer peter jackson has brought the same artistic vision to mortal engines that he did to the lord of the rings films but this time the visual splendor is just too sharp a contrast with a story that is a long long way from the deeply imagined world of tolkien it is based on a seven so far series of books by philip reeve about a postapocalyptic world in which cities roll around on enormous ravenous monster steampunk vehicles the vehicles are pretty cool the story is not its just another derivative postapocalyptic story about utter catastrophe and corruption where the only hope is a small group of hot teenagers a lesser hunger gamesdivergentmaze runnerenders game knockoff with a touch of battlefield earth terminator and even a hint of the original star wars trilogy now episodes iv and v were informed at the beginning that it took just an hour to destroy life as we know it literally geographically remaking the map of the world with superweapons that shattered the surface of the planet humanity has reverted to survival of the fittest which means that there is only a very thin veneer of any kind of social structure beyond might makes right london is might and in the opening scene we see the london literal ship of state take over a smaller cityvehicle absorbing its resources including its residents who are welcomed by being turned into slave labor that thin veneer includes some superficial trappings of the civilization that preceded it including historians who operate a museum where they try to parse the meaning of the shards of 21st century life especially the technology as it appears written records did not survive but we will learn that the real reason for this supposed interest in the past is to get access to the very same weapons that caused the disaster santayana said that those who do not study history are condemned to repeat it in this case the only history that is studied is by those who intend to repeat it the real star of the film is production designer dan hennah the machinery is wonderfully intricate and detailed the settings are so gorgeously done that they just point up the underimagined quality of the script which is basically a rebel girl with a scar on her face hera hilmar as hester shaw and a historian from the museum robert sheehan as tom natsworthy are on the run from the evil thaddeus valentine hugo weaving who killed hesters mother and tried to kill tom he is the one whose interest in the museums artifacts was just a cover for tracking down all the missing pieces to reconstruct the big blaster but he has a nice blonde daughter named katherine leila george who gets to find out that her father has been lying to her about pretty much everything hester and tom are also on the run from a terminatortype cyborgzombie who was once a man but is now a singleminded killing machine stephen lang warming up for avatar sequels or maybe cooling down from them  some books are fine as they are some are untranslatable to the screen and some like this one should stay between the covers because bringing them to life only shows how lifeless they are parents should  know that this movie includes intense and sometimes graphic peril and violence murder explosions knives guns bombs characters injured and killed including parents and some disturbing images
Dec 14 2018,positive, the movie directed by christian rivers is visually stunning the team of screenwriters  fran walsh philippa boyens and peter jackson  proved with the lord of the rings they can do epic films well and this bigbudget picture is no exception the world has been ruined by a 60minute war that took out much of civilization but the stark landscape makes for an interesting backdrop as you watch the main characters run for their lives the giant steampunk contraption that london has become rolls along consuming other cities in its path it is a fascinating blend of old technology and modern ideas the ideas of territory and borders have become obsolete as london rumbles across the earth in search of resources you can ponder the meaning of civilization and how people treat each other in a society where people who are relegated to the lower rungs of society are literally kept underground and if you like action the movie delivers fight and chase scenes in abundance the actress jihae from the television series mars has a couple of thrilling fight scenes as anna fang as does newcomer hera hilmar as hester shaw  for example much of the plot revolves around a city lacking technology and resources but there are fantastic flying machines that seem to have plenty of power and advanced weaponry maybe some of those questions are answered in the 2001 philip reeves novel of the same name upon which the film is based but even at two hours and eight minutes the film doesnt have time to tie up all of its loose ends or maybe it doesnt mean to mortal engines is an entertaining movie if you dont ask to many questions of the story and stick to whats put in front of you onscreen
Dec 14 2018,positive,part buddy movie part origin part legend setting  mortal engines has a lot to like about it but jeepers it really packs far too much in
Dec 14 2018,negative, a loopy combination of superhero movie bond film the legend of king arthur david attenboroughs blue planet and for those old enough to recall itvs world of sport the saturday afternoon wrestling from brent town hall aquaman is like the weirdest dream you will ever have it begins with nicole kidman looking even more airbrushed than she did the other week on graham nortons sofa washing up on some rocks next to a lighthouse she duly settles down to a life of domestic bliss with tom curry temuera morrison the lighthouse keeper and soon they have a son arthur  he grows up to become the kind of hairy tattooed hunk who had he not been heir to the mighty underwater realm of atlantis might well have ended up grappling with giant haystacks and big daddy on world of sport arthur as if you need telling is otherwise known as aquaman and this sixth instalment of the socalled dc extended universe is the first time he has carried a movie on his own he is played by jason momoa who could probably carry a range rover on his own momoa was even born in hawaii for heavens sake and looks as if he has been waiting all his life to be cast as aquaman  by the time arthuraquaman reaches maturity  and boy what maturity  his mother has left the lighthouse and returned to look after her deepsea interests but theres a brouhaha brewing in the briny he is a peroxided rotter called orm patrick wilson who is in league with a grumpy king called nereus dolph lundgren orm is determined to unite the seven underwater kingdoms and declare war on the surface world but contrary to the advice of his vizier vulko willem dafoe no less he is bent on war as revenge on humanity for polluting the oceans that doesnt sound entirely unreasonable if youre halfman halffish but aquaman cant let him wreak havoc and predictably needs only a sacred trident guarded even more predictably by a fearsome sea monster to stop him all this is stretched out to well over two hours but its easy enough to see why director james wan was swept away on a tide of his own ambition after all why not have an entirely pointless but impressively filmic excursion to the sahara desert if your whopping budget a reported 200 million extends to it  and there are some truly exhilarating action sequences including a chase across the terracotta roofs of a picturesque italian town that looks rather like wans audition to direct a bond film atlantis too is gorgeously realised if las vegas remodelled by donald trump were plunged underwater and we live in hope this is what it might look like the script by will beall and david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick works hard on the jokey banter between her and aquaman and for that matter between aquaman and everyone else which in truth feels a little forced like a dc movie trying to emulate a marvel movie but there is plenty here to admire and enjoy too much really mortal engines is another crazy fantasy set well over a thousand years in the future it is based on philip reeves dystopian novel for young adults about cities that come to life and eat each other in a bonkers expression of municipal darwinism first on the menu in this age of the great predator cities of the west is a small bavarian mining town which presumably tastes of bratwurst and is gobbled up by a voraciously greedy london the former is hester shaw icelandic actress hera hilmar an orphan scarred both figuratively and literally by life and more especially by evil thaddeus valentine hugo weaving a twisted archaeologist who also murdered her mother the story chronicles hesters tireless quest for revenge but to believe in it you have also to believe in the notion of traction cities and static cities being pitched against one another in mortal combat and i didnt frankly still the involvement of lord of the rings director peter jackson who was cowriter and producer helps to explain the grandeur of some of the special effects and the outlandish design choices which have the lawenforcers of the faroff future dressed like victorian policemen spiderman into the spiderverse is another disappointment a monumentally long marvel animation which is at least 30 per cent less witty than everyone involved seems to think it is it riffs on the idea that anyone lucky enough to be bitten by a radioactive spider can be spiderman  not just peter parker  and our upwardly mobile hero is mixedrace schoolboy miles morales voiced by shameik moore son of an africanamerican cop and a hispanic nurse a strong voicecast also includes hailee steinfeld as the girl of miless dreams mahershala ali as his uncle liev schreiber as his evil nemesis and nicolas cage as a blackandwhite spiderman from the world of forties film noir there are some nice touches  such as a cameo from spidermans creator the late stan lee in cartoon form  and the actual animation is often wonderful but if ever a film could be described as being pleased with itself this is it at only a whisker under two hours it feels like an endurance test long before the end more than 125 years since she allegedly slaughtered her father and stepmother with an axe lizzie borden remains one of americas most notorious killers on this side of the atlantic however im not sure how much is really known about her lizzie fills in some of the gaps in our knowledge but somewhat prejudicially in that it depicts its title character as a woman quite understandably driven to the end of her tether  chloe sevigny plays lizzie and kristen stewart the familys irish maid bridget the empathy between the pair grows and even becomes sexual as they are driven together by their loathing of lizzies rich tyrannical father jamey sheridan a controlling joyless bully he presides over an utterly wretched new england household filled with women who fear him though lizzie is the only one who dares defy him the borden menfolk not just lizzies father but also his brother are irredeemably nasty almost pantolike in their villainy while the women are all depicted as victims even though lizzie is given good reason to hate her stepmother fiona shaw of course there is hatred and there is savage murder the film presents the latter as a downright reasonable consequence of the former to the extent  spoiler alert for readers outside the united states  that it feels like a relief when lizzie is acquitted whether all this is an accurate telling of the lizzie borden story im not sure and i dont suppose the filmmakers can be sure either  but as a depiction of stuffy new england society in 1892 and of a crime that belonged very much to its time and place its worth seeing from the miserable past to an even more miserable future the netflix film bird box is set in a postapocalyptic america where something is compelling people to kill themselves if they dont see it whatever it is then they stay alive sandra bullock leads a decent cast which also includes john malkovich and tom hollander but this horrorthriller is rarely scary and only fitfully suspenseful largely because the being behind all this malevolence is never seen by us either despite bullocks best efforts as blindfolded and shrieking ominous warnings her character rows two young children down a mistshrouded river it all becomes just a little bit silly puncturing the suspense altogether 
Dec 14 2018,negative, in the future minions will be precious relics and cities will exist on large moving vehicles the postapocalyptic dress code will be steampunk and the human race will have evolved past war and weapons and desperate bids for power because as we learn very quickly mortal engines is a story that deals largely in secrets to start we dont know why hester shaw hera hilmar desperately wants to kill londonbased archeologist thaddeus valentine hugo weaving then we dont know why thaddeus has such a vendetta against hesters late mother we also dont know anything about anna fang jihae a rebel with a price on her head for i think rallying against the existing city systems and we certainly dont know why a zombie robot is so thirsty for hesters blood that hell kill anyone who stands in his way just kidding based on the 2001 book series by philip reeve mortal engines mistakenly swaps out slowburning revelations for explanations that come fast and furious and with no time to digest them which is actually understandable within the first 10 minutes alone we meet nearly a dozen characters who seem to have relevance but then fail to appear onscreen long enough for us to develop our own feelings for them  we know we should cheer for hester and we know we should want her to have a relationship with fellow outcast tom robert sheehan  much like we should feel sympathy for katherine valentine leila george who slowly comes to realize her father thaddeus is a weaponsobsessive megalomaniac but its impossible just when director christian rivers begins to set up a backstory that would help us glean a little more insight into members of the movies motley crew were yanked away into another subplot where once again were forced to figure out whos who why and whether we should even bother to let them in so by the hour mark you just  dont especially since instead of gingerly peeling back story layers or character traits memories are delivered via flashbacks montages and aha moments which  and not to spoil anything but for the record  is the least effective way to make anybody emotional over an angry zombierobot of course you cant expect a lot more if youre packing so much plot into a twohour movie especially if you dont have a multipicture deal that would provide more time to develop characters seriously imagine packing three harry potter books into one of the shortest movies and then just expecting everyone to understand voldemorts intentions and its a testimony to the acting of hilmar and jihae that despite us knowing next to nothing about their characters they still make us care enough to hope they dont die but unfortunately that isnt enough because while a handful of characters do seem interesting enough to justify zooming in on their pasts and realities heres me petitioning for a standalone movie about anna fang the dozens of others we meet make mortal engines feel like a catwalk of character tropes weve seen presented better elsewhere which isnt fair to anybody not the audience not fans of the franchise and certainly not to the actors who despite lacklustre dialogue and character development genuinely seem to be trying their best whats ironic and frustrating is that in an era defined by a constant feeling of doom a story that could actually capitalize on it makes us feel that way only when we all realize its been nearly an hour in to the story and were still meeting new characters
Dec 14 2018,positive,i do admire its ambition sense of scale and appealing main cast full content review for parents  violence etc  also available
Dec 14 2018,negative, i dont want to say the new mortal engines is a witless classic along the lines of those films it has some energy and some memorable images if only it had more of those things and less of all the clutter and noise that otherwise distinguish it this is not a peter jackson movie if thats what you may have thought its a peter jacksonadjacent movie adapted by the hobbity auteur and his longtime collaborators fran walsh and phillippa boyens from a fantasy novelthe first in a series of fourby philip reeve the project was then passed off to jackson prot√©g√© christian rivers who won an oscar for the effects work on his mentors 2005 king kong and is here presenting us with his first feature he is a master of digital animation for surealthough by the time this movie shuffles past the twohour mark youre not likely to care much about that anymore the story which is rather complicated and heavily bedecked with exposition is set in yet another of those postapocalyptic dystopias that looks like 200 miles of bad road stretched out under a blazing outland sun were in new zealand of course this is all thats left after a sixty minute war trashed the planet 1100 years ago in the centuries since then humankind has somehow but how managed to take whole major citieslondon is the traction city were concerned with hereand mount them on tank treads and then drive them around the dismal flatlands in search of other cities to eat or more precisely to suck into huge mechanical maws and strip of their assets old tech is especially prized particularly weapons grade although ancient broken toasters and cracked iphones are also happily scarfed up and set out for display in the british museumwhich is of course right on board apart from jackson regular hugo weavinghere playing thaddeus valentine a science bigwig who conducts mysterious experiments in st pauls cathedral high atop the giant londonmobilethe rest of the cast is relatively littleknown which is okay since most of the characters they play are shuffled around so briskly they have virtually no room to register valentine has a bland daughter on whom he dotes leila george but she and her boyfriendbuddywhatever the oddly monikered bevis pod ronan raftery are pure pudding and offer little support for the movies central couple an obscurely motivated young interloper named hester shaw hera hilmar and annoyingly puppylike museum historian tom natsworthy robert sheehan hilmar whose character is intent on killing valentine for some reason has a fresh spunky energy but sheehan is a young actor of very little charisma which leaves a large hole at the center of the movie fortunately there are two memorable characters one is a towering robokiller called shrike an unrecognizable stephen lang who has a bizarre and longrunning relationship with hester and in the end brings some unexpected heart to the proceedings the other is an exotic air pirate named anna fang south korean pop musician jihae who in her zerocool shades and the fabulous crimson plane she docks at a hovering sky city strongly recalls the 2004 scifi miniclassic sky captain and the world of tomorrow a movie id recommend before recommending this one as a work of action filmmaking the picture isnt a lot more than the sum of its appropriations the mad max overtones the miyazaki echoes the star wars references all over the place its also overstuffed with instructional dialogue contemplating earths goldenage civilization of yore and its presentday ruin one character says how can a society so advanced be so stupid says another what have we done says a third possibly confused we should never have gone to europe start your day with reason get a daily brief of the most important stories and trends every weekday morning when you subscribe to reason roundup
Dec 14 2018,positive,the visuals are fantastic and the world building leaves plenty to explore if mortal engines is by any chance successful enough to spawn a sequel lets just hope the story does a better job of staying in its own lane

Dec 14 2018,neutral, as the years go on the comparisons between peter jackson and george lucas only grow more and more apparent after each bringing to the screen iconic film trilogies that defined their generations both filmmakers have failed to live up to their legacies they both eventually put out prequels to their beloved films to controversial results and have mostly spent their time since producing for others and pushing new filmmaking technology remember 48framespersecond anyone but after a brief hiatus jackson is back and making another attempt at adapting a high concept novel to the screen producing and cowriting the film with christian rivers in his feature directorial debut after working in storyboarding and previs on many of jacksons pictures mortal engines is a chance for jackson to prove he still has a worthwhile postlord of the rings career the result a resounding meh having not read the book series by phillip reeve i can only judge mortal engines as a film rather than an adaptation but i can understand why the novel was popular and had great potential for a movie just from watching i say potential because mortal engines never seems to get its own engine revving efficiently whilst the story world itself is respectfully imaginative the story and characters are functional at best if youve heard at least one fantasy adventure plot in your life mortal engines will sound eerily familiar whilst fans of the genre should be able to calculate every plot turn beat for beat normally interesting characters would compensate for this and add unique flair to differentiate itself from its contemporaries but they are just as perfunctory as the narrative everything can just be summed up as its fine the story is structured and paced decently theres no embarrassing dialogue or ridiculously outoffield plot turns and it smartly doesnt sequelbait and remains a functional selfcontained story theres nothing in mortal engines that flatout doesnt work but not being bad doesnt equal being good it just means its unremarkable and i should not be saying that about a postapocalyptic steampunk adventure that features a cockroachmobile and a zombie cyborg if there is anything to say is at fault i believe its that the movie just takes itself too seriously there is an inkling of humour and even some sociopolitical satire to the text but everything is presented so matteroffactly that it just falls flat if the film at least had a good sense of humour about itself it would have been easier to forgive its reliance on tropes casting a bigbudget movie without many recognisable stars is a doubleedged sword on the one hand it allows the actors to better assimilate into their characters making the world more believable to an audience instead of pulling them out of it because they recognise soandso from some gossip rag on the other hand it means you lose a major selling point when you dont have something to attract an unfamiliar audience in and it especially doesnt work when the actors you have cast arent particularly compelling hera hilmar does a decent enough job as protagonist hester shaw avoiding typical ya heroine tropes by giving her a more embittered antihero streak but her performance doesnt grow in line with her character even after learning more of her backstory and seeing her grow to be more trusting and heroic she remains too impenetrable to fully embrace her as our protagonist and hilmars stoic performance shoulders a lot of that blame robert sheehan doesnt exactly help either as tom natsworthy playing the nebbish sidekick who learns heroism through adversity and also falls for the badass lady who saves him constantly despite saying she doesnt care about him just as constantly but who still falls for him too anyway so rigidly to the script that you can predict his arc right from his first scene jihae is just as plagued by blandness as rebel leader anna fang whilst leila george and ronan raftery linger in an underdeveloped subplot that only exists to provide further exposition to the villains plot speaking of are you at all surprised that hugo weaving is playing the bad guy in this yeah i didnt think so the only character that has anything really going for them is stephen lang as the aforementioned zombie cyborg shrike with an interesting characterization and a compelling relationship between him and hesterthat the movie quickly squanders just as it gets interesting i dont know book readers does this ever become important again in the sequels because i would watch the hell out of a movie just about hester and shrike though it has a similar attention to detail and breadth to its world mortal engines certainly doesnt try to ape the aesthetic of the middleearth movies instead it clearly borrows a lot of inspiration for its design from studo ghibli movies specifically nausicaa of the valley of the wind and laputa castle in the sky its certainly a wellaccomplished spectacle to bring these vibrant and ostentatious designs to liveaction and it only makes we wish this amount of effort were in service of a more interesting story however in terms of execution mortal engines is certainly more in the hobbut camp than lord of the rings mainly down to a similar overuse of cgi that creates a disparate uncanny valley feeling between the liveaction and computergenerated elements and even the elements that are liveaction have a warped design sensibility that makes them feel cgi even though theyre not ill be honest here i saw mortal engines only yesterday and im struggling right now to even remember the most basic details it is just that unmemorable it certainly isnt a film made without effort but only enough to function rather than thrive in a crowded holiday release schedule and without a relevant ip or compelling stars to carry it jacksons dwindling clout isnt anywhere near enough to keep this film afloat amongst more distinctive competition it honestly feels like a film released about a decade too late put it out around the same time as the golden compass or the spiderwick chronicles and it might have stood a better chance but in 2018 with so many better releases coming to screens every month and a huge catalogue of past similar films to discover or revisit mortal engines doesnt deliver anything you couldnt get better elsewhere
Dec 14 2018,negative,based on the first of 8 sequel  prequel novels this engine quickly runs out of gas please please please peter jackson spare us  dont do the other 7 or 6 or
Dec 14 2018,negative, there was a time when postapocalyptic films roamed the landscape pillaging better movies for spare parts that time is now and that movie is mortal engines in which a ravaged earths population now inhabits cities on wheels london is helmed by a scientific striver hugo weaving obsessed with empirebuilding when hes confronted by a young woman from his past hera hilmar hes got it in for her and her accomplice a renegade historian robert sheehan theres some steampunk design to like plus a frankensteinsmonster zombie stephen lang and the gangster confidence of actress jihae as a resistance fighter but most of mortal engines is a wearying blast of cgi and genrecribbing most egregiously director christian rivers hired composer junkie xl to seemingly lift wholesale his soundtrack from mad max fury road then again as london rattles out of europe on a perilous collision course perhaps screenwriters peter jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens just meant this as one hilarious brexit metaphor
Dec 14 2018,negative, how did this truly crummy movie get made i have a theory coproducers peter jackson and fran walsh who once upon a time could put together a motion picture that was engaging coherent entertaining and even genuinely dazzling looked at a bag of money that universal and sundry other sources of capital left on their table and asked themselves can we whiff as badly as the wachowskis did with jupiter ascending only leaving out the fun pansexual campy parts and the answer is absolutely glenn kenny was the chief film critic of premiere magazine for almost half of its existence he has written for a host of other publications and resides in brooklyn  read his answers to our movie love questionnaire here
Dec 14 2018,negative,there are fleeting pleasures to be had here in brexitera parallelsbut too soon the movie returns to deadening clich√©s a doomsday weapon a plucky band of rebels blankfaced performances and truly horrible linereadings
Dec 14 2018,negative,the coolest thing about this movie is that its a really imaginative interesting world the biggest bummer is that they didnt take that interesting imaginative world and put it in a movie that works
Dec 14 2018,negative, a feast for the eyes if not necessarily the brain this adaptation of a sciencefiction novel by british author philip reeve finds its narrative substance overwhelmed by visual spectacle despite its ambitious postapocalyptic premise the muddled and convoluted screenplay is a disappointment considering its written by the lord of the rings team of peter jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens all of which have won oscars as the story opens most of earth has been ravaged by a conflict known as the sixty minute war leaving many survivors caught up in the concept of municipal darwinism which refers to smaller mobile cities being literally swallowed up by larger ones for example london has stacked many of its landmarks and citizens on a rolling tanklike mechanism thats where a scarred young woman named hester hera hilmar climbs aboard with a mission  to kill the archaeologist hugo weaving who allegedly murdered her mother her quest for revenge turns into a fight for survival alongside tom robert sheehan who likewise has a score to settle but few resources at his disposal gradually they assemble a ragtag group of young rebels with the goal of infiltrating london and stopping the development of a massive weapon that could wipe out most of the remaining human population flashbacks gradually reveal more details about hesters back story including her bizarre relationship with shrike stephen lang a disfigured skeleton creature who has since become an enemy under rookie director christian rivers who worked as a storyboard artist on jacksons films mortal engines is an impressive technical achievement including a stylish depiction of a stark dystopian landscape combined with seamless special effects the opening chase sequence when we first see entire cities on wheels is especially something to behold the script includes elements of political allegory regarding immigration and imperialism also functioning as a cautionary tale about futuristic urban planning and mechanical engineering as it funnels into an elaborately chaotic finale at any rate this latest attempt to launch a youngadult fantasy franchise is saddled with characters who arent as compelling as their surroundings that limits the incentive for emotional investment either in the outcome of this first installment or any that might follow
Dec 14 2018,negative, plot  in a postapocalyptic future the remnants of civilization are divided into two camps tractionists who roam the wasteland in giant mobile cities eating up smaller cities and antitractionists  who seek to rebuild civilization by settling on land head of the tractionists is thaddeus valentine hugo weaving who survives an assassination attempt by the scarred hester hera hilmar an attack witnessed by historian tom natsworthy robert sheehan who gets thrown together with hester in a flight from valentines minions review  what makes a company sink over a hundred million dollars into a sprawling fantasy epic with no stars thats based on a property with only minor name recognition and blatantly steals from the mad max series specifically fury road and star wars peter jackson i presume with this being the latest effort from his wingnut films one which he also produced and cowrote with regular collaborators fran walsh and philippa boyens if universal was hoping this would be a new franchise they need to think again as despite some arresting eye candy this is as generic a scifisteampunk thriller as they come made all the worse by a silly premise and so muchworld building that it feels like a ten episode season of a tv show cutdown to two hours if ever there was evidence that fantasy when not based on an established property is better off being done longform on tv this is it too much happens too quickly characters come in and out of the film at random only to perish a few scenes later in moments that are supposed to be impactful but arent others seems to exist only to provide exposition such as a clunky subplot featuring the baddies daughter leila george and an engineer ronan raftery who do nothing but explain things or catch us up on the complicated history of the films postapocalyptic universe its the kind of movie that if you pop out for a minute to go to the bathroom youll be utterly lost by the time youre back in your seat one of the biggest problems this film has is the fact that the characters are so generic theyre based on familiar archetypes and unlikely to cause an audience to identify with them in enough of a way that theyll want to see a franchise built around them no one is bad per se but a few more recognizable actors pepperedin would have helped this standout from the pack a little more of them all heroine hera hilmar stands out the most with her flaming red hair and the distinct scar shes given  although shes far too attractive to justify all the characters reacting with disgust when then see the scar it actually makes her look kinda cool  and i have i hard time believing it would make anyone shun her robert sheehan is fine but twodimensional as the romantic lead and costar jihae as the antiheroine anna fang is clearly meant to be a breakout star but the performance is a tad stilted to really connect  although thats not her failing as an actress but rather a symptom of the material as the baddie weaving is saddled with a ridiculous wig while stephen lang at least manages to inject a little heart as shrike a kind of zombie robot with a grudge against our heroine id wager the only reason to see mortal engines is if youre a fantasy addict but there are a lot of better options out there for your holiday viewing the eye candy is pretty but the premise of mobile cities is so silly that the premise falls apart before the movie can even begin  although ill give it this  it has an excellent score by junkie xl so maybe buy the score  but skip the film its not worth the trip chris bumbray began his career with joblo as the resident film critic and james bond expert way back in 2007 and he has stuck around ever since being named editorinchief in 2021 a voting member of the cca and a rotten tomatoesapproved critic you can also catch chris discussing pop culture regularly on ctv news channel  we have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 years later a trilogy of sequels to danny boyle and alex garlands 28 days later the fall guy just hit cinemacon for a victory lap after premiering at sxsw does it live up to the hype and give ryan gosling a clasic role
Dec 14 2018,negative, december is usually the time of year that the movie world is dominated by a mix of prestige dramas with awards aspirations and family fare designed to take advantage of the holiday season increasingly though the major studios tend to find room to sneak a blockbuster or two onto the schedule  an opportunity to offer some counterprogramming to those who love big movies with big budgets and big spectacle universal is banking on exactly that sort of success with the release of mortal engines from peter jacksons studio wingnut films based on the book by philip reeve mortal engines imagines a world in the farflung future where weapons of mass destruction have crippled the earth and certain cities have turned into mobile battle tanks in an attempt to survive the biggest and baddest of these cities is london led by valentine hugo weaving whose lust for power drives his every move he eventually runs afoul of tom robert sheehan who accidentally witnesses him attempt to murder a mysterious young girl hester shaw hera hilmar and is banished from london to assure valentine can cover his tracks forming an uneasy alliance hester and tom soon discover valentines plan to build a super weapon and destroy the shield wall protecting shan guo a peaceful land of nonmobile cities he sees as rife for pillage they team up with fang jihae a hotshot pilot with the resistance to take on valentine and end things once and for all director christian rivers has never helmed a feature himself but hes no stranger to the world of big budget movies rivers has been working with peter jackson for nearly his entire career storyboarding all of his movies since braindead and working extensively on visual effects for all of his films its safe to say that after working on the lord of the rings and the hobbit films he would feel completely at home with a movie of the scope and scale of mortal engines and from the perspective of a visual and storyboard artist its easy to see where his talents lie rivers was given a 100 millionplus budget and that money is clearly visible all over the screen the size of these giant cities rumbling across an arid countryside is the sort of sight designed for the big screen and when it comes time for action he blows things up but good its clear where his expertise lies this is the danger you run with a visual effects supervisor turned director the visuals of mortal engines are undeniably impressive but they barely cover the tremendous shortcomings of the script there was a time when jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens would have been considered a feather in the movies cap but their penchant for epic exhaustive storytelling and heros journey clich√©s fails to play well with a director who couldnt care less about the story or characters if he tried the movies worldbuilding is generally reduced to word salad phrases like municipal darwinism and antitractionists that sound important but mean absolutely nothing the result is a script deeply convinced of its own cleverness and gravitas thats executed with the skill of a syfy original movie the characters are lifeless piles of archetypes the love story is completely unbelievable and while hugo weaving gets to sneer and mug his way through the movie as its central villain nothing ever matters in the slightest it doesnt feel livedin or natural its a theme park ride  it may be a tad cynical to note the importance that china plays in the films climax well not a country named china as this world is long since past that but the protagonists are racing to save a great wall protecting the sovereign peaceloving people of clear chinese descent so its not all that difficult to connect the dots blockbusters are increasingly becoming globally focused with the chinese market an easy route to success even if a movie fails in the states its tough not to think about the third act of mortal engines as a direct attempt to make this movie a success in china by making them the good guys now thats not an inherently bad thing if you build out the foundation and make it work but the plot design of mortal engines is so slapdash that theres no sense of who these people are or their motivations making them amount to nothing more than their race and a foil for the bad guys as such the final battle has no stakes or excitement theres no reason to care about these people other than their existence as the opposition to weavings cartoonish villain its the sort of lazy storytelling that almost feels like cultural appropriation especially when the soldiers arrive in the final scenes wearing a steampunk version of traditional chinese armor  in practice mortal engines is exactly as dumb as it seems to be on the surface theres plenty of room for dumb action movies and the fast and furious franchise has proven that those movies can be both fun and outrageously profitable but rivers film fails because it wants to be more than that it wants to tell some sweeping story in the grand tradition and turn it into a franchise akin to star wars whose plot it cribs from often unfortunately none of it works or resonates the explosions are cool and the tank cities are welldesigned but its all sound and fury a film like mortal engines should be a breath of fresh air the antidote to the litany of superhero movies and endless sequels its complete

Dec 14 2018,negative, philip reeves mortal engines book is a classic young adult book full of intriguing ideas and cutting social commentary specifically the book not the series as mortal engines sequels lost their way very quickly the book is seventeen years old now making it a strange choice to adapt as the people who were young adults upon its release are adults now and people who are young adults now have newer and flashier film franchises as such mortal engines never works out what to be  its first act is a fantastic smorgasbord of all the themes icons and aesthetics that made the books popular with great characterization of the protagonist smart worldbuilding and impressive production quality however as soon as its characters hit the ground of the second act it devolves rapidly into a generic ya story with bland characters poorly set up motivations and plans and a general lack of personalitymortal engines is set in a postapocalyptic world in which cities have been mobilized turned into giant settlements on wheels that roam the ruined world and prey on smaller towns the protagonist played by robert sheehan in the film is a resident of london who discovers the true face of a corrupt patriarch and is forcefully exiled into the wildernesswhile it never turns into an outright bad film it fails to deliver on the promise set up by its first act it seems director christian rivers understood the book enough to set up the world but not enough to successfully represent its characters and the themes they stood for  either that or he felt trotting out tired ya cliches would appeal to the nebulous audience betteropen as you mean to go onthe previous plot summary only really covers the first act of the film  after being exiled the main character teams up with a stranger with a mysterious past hera hilmar and they go on a variety of adventures teaming up with a resistance force begrudgingly growing to fall for each other and dealing with hilmars troubled past while it follows the beats of the book fairly well it burdens them with the many trite cliches of ya fiction that even young adults hatesource universal pictureshilmars mysterious past moody attitude and hidden deformity a tiny scratch on her face which leads characters to act as though shes hideously deformed  for some reason make her one in a million similar protagonists  the character is indistinguishable from olivia cookes character from ready player one besides her past she isnt given any inkling of character or personality and theres no substance behind her mysterious persona similarly sheehan goes on the briefest of character arcs near the climax of the film and has no growth or change otherwise  which is curious given that in the first act of the film hes portrayed in a surprisingly nuanced way with a unique perspective on the world the past and the characters of the storythe other characters are the same with no characterization motivations or chemistry to speak of the villain played by hugo weaving could be the closest to an actual character throughout although of course his greatest moments of nuance and perspective are all in the first actthe action is a rather mixed bag  while the city chases and action setpieces are rather well choreographed and filmed gunfights are mediocre and handtohand combat is shot in a totally bewildering way perhaps as a result of the fact that its impossible to be invested in the characters the entire climax of the film is terrifyingly dullsource universal pictureshowever its the story that really lets the the film down the characters have no real influence on the plot until the end as theyre constantly wandering about with no real direction a subplot towards the middle of the film takes full focus for a good half hour until its suddenly resolved and although this subplot was present in the book it feels purely included to dig up a certain spoilery cliche similarly the rebellion the characters join seems built on a foundation of insufferable ya tropes and cliches with a lack of camaraderie conviction or personality making them perhaps the most boring part of the filmwhile some of the offending elements were present in the book in it they all served the storys themes and ideas in mortal engines the film theyre just used as performative elements to signal that its a ya film without intrinsically contributing anything themselvesfinding your themeswhile the book mortal engines was an exciting and imaginative dystopian thriller before dystopian meant the bland aesthetic it does now it worked perfectly as a metaphor for state capitalism it does after all tell the story of giant city states hunting down and recycling smaller settlements  the rulers of large states order their moving economies to literally consume smaller ones with no regard for the good or longevity of the people resulting in various economic social and cultural crisesthe most pleasantly surprising part of mortal engines is that it does import insightful social commentary from the book although it portrays the actions of its villains and the giant cities more as indicative of colonialism than capitalism the distinctly victorian production design and costumes all seem to defer to notions of the british empire perpetuated in the victorian times in which britain and its beating heart london forged a huge empire with no regard for the people and lands they conqueredthis is exactly what happens in the introductory action scene as a giant london with the union jack emblazoned on it hunts down and captures a smaller settlement the seeminglyheroic hugo weaving tells the captured prisoners that they are all welcome to the city  all whilst guards seize their belongings and their old city is demolished in the background to become part of the amorphous mass that is london this scene in particular works as a cutting and insightful critique of the damaging effect of forced globalization and capitalistdriven colonialismsource universal picturesunfortunately this theme is largely forgotten for the remainder of the film while the climax of the film could be interpreted as a denouement to this idea it seems more a sideeffect of keeping the plot of the books than an intentional continuation of the themethe themes presented at the beginning of the film are some of the aspects parts of the film  old statues of minions referred to as deities of the ancient ones modern humans is amusing and mentions of the fallen civilization intercut with archaic iphones and other technology all worked well to set up the tale as a cautionary tale of destructive technology the necessary evils of capitalism and the tragic logical conclusion to british colonialism its just a shame the majority of the film forgets to extrapolate on these ideasmortal engines conclusionits a real pity that mortal engines wasted its potential so much because for the halfhour of the film it far exceeded any other ya film in terms of skilled storytelling and filmmaking it was even shaping up to be one of the best fantasy films of the year  until the ya cliches got in the way and drained the reserves of personality it hadthe characters are bland but never offensively so the action is forgettable but apart from a select few scenes its never a total drag the pacing is wonky but the story is always clearly going somewhere if it hadnt been for the astounding introduction the film would be okay but because we can see what rivers is capable of in the first act it feels distressing that the rest of the film misses this mark so badlythe film isnt necessarily a bad one and at least mortal engines is distinct enough in its world and message to make one of the better young adult films around but dont go expecting the start of a fantastic new fantasy franchise as the only novel elements of it are what it tries to say not what it tries to dois it okay for a film aimed at young adults to try to

cultural crisesthe most pleasantly surprising part of mortal engines is that it does import insightful social commentary from the book although it portrays the actions of its villains and the giant

Dec 14 2018,negative, this visionary mess is this years valerian and the city of a thousand planets a big budget bust that was somehow financed by a major studio despite being made for an audience of well who exactly maybe 11yearolds who play world of warcraft will like it no one else will at least not unironically  the premise should require its own wikipedia entry at least 1100 years in the future traction cities  think london as a giant tank  roam the earth and swallow up smaller independent settlements which are also on wheels the communities on board london have museums filled with ancient junk from our current times known as the screen age our era is reduced to statues of minions and a couple of cracked iphones  outside the big mobile metropolis rebel warrior hester shaw hera hilmar seeks her opportunity for revenge against thaddeus valentine hugo weaving a cartoonishly villainous and power hungry london authority figure when she misses her shot shes forced to wander the countryside with tom natsworthy robert sheehan a historian whos fallen out of favor with valentine who helps her in her quest to get back on board and take down the bad guy  directed by peter jackson apprentice christian rivers and based on the 2001 young adult novel mortal engines isnt savvy enough to work as social commentary and is too clunky to work as an action movie even its leads are unappealing hilmar and sheehan have the romantic chemistry of a brother and sister it adds up to a giant slog a movie that despite its ambitious look doesnt manage to offer us anything new in the screen age wed refer to it as an epic fail
Dec 14 2018,negative, for though its based on the first volume of philip reeves highly regarded young adult series and adapted by the same trio who won an oscar for lord of the rings from a dramatic point of view this story set 1700 years in the future is static and inert the directing debut for peter jackson protege christian rivers who won a visual effects oscar for king kong mortal engines is bursting with everything youd want except compelling emotional intelligence made completely in new zealand with a cast largely devoid of big names and taking advantage of the moviemaking community that created the rings and the hobbit trilogies mortal engines elicits marvelous work from a weta digital team including visual effects supervisor ken mcgaugh and animation supervisor dennis yoo in fact so many worlds are imagined and created in such meticulous detail  production designer is dan hennah conceptual art director is ra vincent cinematographer is simon raby  that at moments you cease caring how flat the storytelling is and give yourself over to this insane film half wonderful and half monotonous where rivers the actors and the screenwriting team of fran walsh philippa boyens and jackson went wrong is hard to pin down specifically though the plot of mortal engines barrels along in terms of events its only sporadically involving on the level it intends to be so many worlds are created in such meticulous detail that at moments you cease caring how flat the storytelling is and give yourself over to this insane film the film begins with a recap of the past  how the use of a terrifying weapon of mass destruction had catastrophic results sixty minutes were told is all it took for the ancients to bring humanity to the brink of extinction what exists now in the 38th century is a world of impossibly large predator cities on wheels steampunkinfluenced monstrosities that look like howls moving castle from the hayao miyazaki film pumped up on steroids the greatest of these traction cities as theyre called is london where the presiding genius though not the actual ruler is accomplished scientist thaddeus valentine played by the films only recognizable star lotr veteran hugo weaving throwing us right into the middle of things mortal engines opens with london on wheels chasing down a small bavarian mining town the way a massive lion would close in on an unlucky antelope londons great enemy off somewhere in the distant east protected by a massive force field is the stationary metropolis of shan guo though the novel was written in 2001 its east versus west faceoff feels eerily contemporary yes it all sounds completely nuts but the gift of the visual imagination invested in this film is to make it appear before us in a completely convincing way the people unfortunately not so much introduced as a london resident is tom natsworthy robert sheehan a nerdy enthusiast for the past who works for the citys historians guild and looks after artifacts like american deities we immediately recognize as largescale minions replicas one of the things tom always keeps an eye out for are pieces of whats called old tech remnants of the weapon systems that nearly destroyed the earth that tom correctly thinks are still too dangerous to be out and about we also spend considerable time with the mysterious hester shaw icelandic actress hera hilmar introduced wearing a red bandanna that hides a scarred face the scar is considerably worse in the book leading to online back and forth between the filmmakers and the novels fans not in london when the film begins hester has reasons rooted in her past for wanting to access the city but no sooner does she achieve that than she and tom are almost simultaneously thrown together and thrown off the city left to fend for themselves on earths trackless wastes the pair survive on found food like antediluvian twinkies from back in the day causing hester to knowingly proclaim the food of the ancients is indestructible they also meet some wild and crazy characters like anna fang jihae a hip aviatrix with a price on her head whos also the head of something called the antitraction league much scarier is the nightmarish shrike avatars stephen lang the last of the lazarus brigade a zombietype individual half man half machine who is obsessed with finding hester all this may sound involving on paper but on screen mortal engines manages to be largely devoid of dramatic energy yet its a measure of how captivating its visuals are that i wouldnt hesitate to see it again if only to try and pin down just what went wrong
Dec 14 2018,negative, mortal engines is a surprisingly fitting name for what is hopefully the last tired attempt at a ya dystopian franchise starter to cough and sputter its way into theaters like most of the others it takes place in a distant future where people talk pretty much the same way we do now except they have kind of funny names magnus crome dr twix and its up to a young person and their friends to topple an unjust authoritarian system our familiarity with the formula is tragically only part of the reason the movie feels like its a hundred hours long this time around we drop in more than a millennium after our present day the cities and towns of europe have gone mobile becoming huge fossil fueldriven contraptions on which the citizenry lives and works smaller towns drive around europe mining what they can from the soil while the larger predator cities hunt them down and strip them of resources one such city is london where the lead historian thaddeus valentine another funny name played by hugo weaving has designs on increasing the firepower and dominance of his moving metropolis however a young woman with a personal vendetta hester shaw hera hilmar seeks to take him down to do so she teams up with an apprentice historian tom natsworthy robert sheehan and eventually an increasingly indistinct band of rebels thats just an economical description of the story theres actually much more way too much in fact as evidenced by the lengths of time mortal engines has to devote to explaining itself even after the opening narration most of the first act seems to be taken up by dialogue that fills in the gaps of how the world came to be this way and the specific rules of daily life within it those bits are broken up by the occasional massive and noisy visual effects sequence and then we return to exposition yet even with all the tabkeeping the movie seems to be doing its still inconsistent its dangerous for two people on foot to build a fire out in the wild because a scavenger town might find them but it is apparently okay for a seemingly undefended village to drive around with its crazy big headlights on thats just nitpicking though that kind of laziness is more than acceptable in a movie that excels where it counts but mortal engines doesnt do that either whatever class critique allegories are present they are thousandth generation copies the movies london is an uninspired blend of metropolis and titanic with various classes assigned to literal tiers any attempts to reach beyond that are clumsy and potentially offensive when london captures a saltmining town the townsfolk are warned by an offscreen voice via loudspeaker that children may be separated from their parents a line that could very well have been added only recently to address real life events later hester and tom will be put up for bid in a slave auction because of the superficiality of these representations of actual events they are tasteless where director christian rivers and screenwriters fran walsh philippa boyens and peter jackson might imagine they are poignant these feints at i suppose social consciousness also ring hollow when stacked alongside the movies patronizing backwards orientalism valentines ultimate target is the verdant land beyond the shield wall which separates europe from a peaceful society of asian people who have not pillaged and polluted their own homes on the plus side though this condescending characterization at least helps distinguish some individuals from others something the flat homogenous humorless screenplay is otherwise unable to accomplish rivers matches the script with a color palette that is as dull as the rest of the movie and a sense of framing that feels haphazard more often than not i would call mortal engines the most stupefyingly wrongheaded postapocalyptic movie since kevin costners the postman but i fear its unrelenting drabness makes it even worse
Dec 14 2018,negative, mortal engines which is produced by peter jackson and written by the team behind the lord of the rings films is grandly majestically epically inert a highconcept fantasy with a wide chasm between the money we see up on the screen and poverty of the story in the line of such recent eyecandy productions as luc bessons valerian and the city of a thousand planets or steven spielbergs ready player one  the movie is adapted from young adult fiction the first of philip reeves four steam punkstyled mortal engines novel series the premise which is never easy to swallow is that in the postapocalyptic future entire cities are mounted on tank treads and race about ravaging the devastated planets remaining resources in a battle of municipal darwinism most of the action takes place in london now a jumble of tiered buildings with the dome of st pauls cathedral on top and the london eye ferris wheel carting people up and down in the opening and best sequence we see the big london tank which is now roaming about bavaria chasing down a small mobile mining town harpooning it and drag it on board where the resources are sucked up and the citizens put to work in short order we move from the farfetched to the exasperating firsttime director christian rivers a longtime storyboard and visual effects coordinator for jacksons films shows little sensitivity to performances or the mechanics of storytelling establishing the information and emotional beats in an effective fashion our timid insipid lead is tom robert sheehan a nervous apprentice at the museum of london specializing in the technology of the ancients as folks from our era are called  his work earns the interest of thaddeus valentine hugh weaving who clearly wants these old computer parts for nefarious purposes somewhere deep inside the teeming transit system tom thadeus and the latters daughter katherine leila george encounter a young assassin with a scarf covering her scarred face who stabs thaddeus nonfatally tom chases her as she races off through the gnashing gears and tunnels of the citys underbelly but both of them end up getting tossed down a giant waste chute to the outside world the wouldbe assassin named hester shaw icelandic actress hera hilmar has a grudge against thaddeus for killing her archaeologist mother when hester was a child  tom and hester are stranded together in the rocky wasteland and then later locked together in a room where they fight and fall in love as they struggle to find their way back to the city so hester can finish her assassination plans meanwhile the definitely absolutely and irrefutably evil thaddeus is busy building a superweapon to launch from the dome of st pauls that will wipe out a huge wall protecting the static cities to the east worried that his wouldbe killer hester is still alive thaddeus sends a zombie with a skull head and glowing jade eyes named shrike stephen lang to get rid of her you see shrike feels betrayed by hester because he was sort of a daddy figure after her mother was killed but honestly who cares the guys a killer zombie while the action splashes and explodes across the screen fantasy fans can check off the references howls moving castle mad max and lots of star wars all pushed into the same garburator  some variety from the overfamiliar is provided by a flashy rebel assassin from the ethnically diverse resistance named anna fang played by americanbased koreanborn musician jihae who sports a rockabilly pompadour and flies about in a red dragonfly like airship 
Dec 14 2018,positive,  film review  mortal engines with hera hilmar robert sheehan hugo weaving jihae stephen lang written by fran walsh  philippa boyens  peter jackson directed by christian rivers rated pg13 for sequences of futuristic violence and action 128 minutes its obvious why the ads for mortal engines prominently mention lord of the rings and the hobbit peter jackson who helmed those series was one of the writers and producers on this however there the connection ends because unlike the tolkien adaptations this is no twee fantasy it is squarely in the science fiction subgenre of steampunk positing a postapocalyptic world utilizing a lot of retro tech based on the ya novel by philip reeve this is a dystopian and visually inventive movie that  with no big names in the cast  may have a hard time finding its audience the setting is many centuries in the future after a destructive war that has laid waste to much of the world several cities have become mobile gobbling up smaller enclaves and their resources thaddeus valentine hugo weaving is an important official in the mobile london surviving an assassination attempt by hester shaw hera hilmar at the start of the story hester escapes and is forced to team with tom robert sheehan a historian of artifacts who has been betrayed by thaddeus the story gets complicated although not difficult to follow as hester and thaddeus head for a final showdown added to the mix is shrike stephen lang a horrific creature pursuing hester who proves to be one of the most complex characters in the story and anna fang jihae who will prove crucial in the fight against thaddeus although the book was followed by several others the movie gets us to a definitive ending leaving the door open for sequels but not requiring them what makes it fascinating even for those unfamiliar with the source material like this reviewer is its stunning visual design from a vast city rolling across desolate wastelands to the technology which is based more on trying to recapture what was lost from the past rather than inventing something new what were shown is never less than fascinating not since black panther have we seen a movie so determined to take us into a world weve never seen on screen prior to this as the smooth villain of the piece weaving walks the line between his characters public image and his actual motives to make clear why people might be fooled into believing him as the films protagonist hilmar may be the first icelandic actress to become an international star shes feisty as hester able to show her vulnerabilities while remaining a strong and tenacious heroine this may turn out to be the break for her that hunger games was for jennifer lawrence daniel m kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of filmrelated books his new novel father of the bride of frankenstein will be released in january he is the 2018 recipient of the skylark award given by the new england science fiction association he lives in somerville massachusetts
