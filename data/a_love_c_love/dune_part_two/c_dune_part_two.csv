Apr 11 2024,positive, making a big studio film is always a risk and intentionally splitting the central narrative across two or more movies amplifies that risk in every possible way sometimes it pays off as with the star wars franchises nearly halfcentury run and sometimes it shits the bed  studios spent 400 million making three divergent films only to cancel the fourth one leaving the whole series without an ending dune hit theaters and hbo max in 2021 with the sequels production dependent on its success and happily that success came both on the big screen and small nearly three years later that sequel has arrived and dune part two is a magnificent followup that blows open the action themes and relationships of the first in fantastically thrilling ways dune ends with the annihilation of the house atreides empire leaving only paul timothée chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson alive the pair are taken in by cautious members of the fremen as paul proclaims his intentions to help the people secure freedom from oppression and the new film picks up mere hours later fremen leader stilgar javier bardem believes paul to be the much prophesied messiah come to save the fremen people others suspect he may be a spy and desert warrior and frequent guest in pauls dreams chani zendaya finds her own convictions about the whole thing conflicting with intense romantic feelings meanwhile space wipe elsewhere in the universe baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård is growing tired of losing very profitable spice harvests to fremen raids on arrakis he dispatches his sadistic nephew feydrautha austin butler to squash the rebellion and kill the mysterious muaddib its paul leading the charge seems like a simple enough clash between good and evil but what if pauls own visions of a holy war  with him at the helm  takes priority theres a lot going on in dune part two far more than a reviews plot synopsis can handle and all of it sings with drama tension thrills and incredibly rich character beats director denis villeneuve shows once again that science fiction is his home as he builds on the first films setup to deliver a true epic enormous setpieces visually stunning effects costume design as eclectic as it is mad and exciting action share the screen with charisma torrents of emotion courtesy of a terrific zendaya and a shifting darkness worthy of an empire strikes back comparison zendayas chani was present in the first film but she appeared mostly as a silent vision before finally arriving late in the third act but shes every bit the heart and soul of dune part two you immediately buy into the fierceness with which she fights and stands for her people and while theres the tease of ya romance early on she quickly finds her footing as an independent voice leery of pauls status as savior to the fremen her love is tangible but its at odds with legitimate concern leading to an emotionally torn performance chalamet shines too and hasnt felt this allin and tangible since call me by your name 2017 and ferguson doubles down as a human monster prone to twisted heinous and devious moves in the shadows other returning performers including josh brolin dave bautista charlotte rampling and bardem all do good work but newcomers quickly make their mark christopher walken plays the emperor of the known universe florence pugh is his daughter and léa seydoux joins lady jessica as another member of the secretive and powerful bene gesserit its butler who steals his every scene though as a brutally intense harkonnen with his own cruel plans for the future while the bulk of the films hefty but never really felt running time unfolds on the golden red sands of arrakis villeneuve wisely shifts our attention elsewhere at times the script cowritten by villeneuve and jon spaihts uses that time to introduce new characters and story threads while cinematographer greig fraser and production designer patrice vermette take the opportunity to cut loose on the visual front scenes on the harkonnen home planet feel almost monochrome in the starkness and their milky alienlike skin and it works to maximize the oppressive nature of their rule its tempting to read some connection to todays very specific real world conflicts into the films depiction of the fremen and their oppressors but that would be a mistake the tragedy and oppression have very real counterparts but the same could be said of the 80s when david lynchs adaptation was released of the 60s when herberts novels first hit shelves and nearly any other time in human history its just what we do as a species every time all the time and herberts fiction just added sand worms all fictions borrow liberally from reality and to get hung up on correlation is to derail the experience that is villeneuves dune part two the film can be enjoyed merely as a big surfacelevel thrill ride delivering memorable sequences like pauls first attempts at riding a giant sand worm and characters worth rooting for or despising the textures and themes are there though for viewers who like their blockbuster entertainment woven through dense worldbuilding critical commentaries on theocracies colonization and the ease with which people succumb to religious delusion come for the spectacle stay for the heart and heroism the delicious villainy and the emotionally epic finale no matter your tastes dune part two has you covered
Apr 7 2024,positive, full disclosure i am a dune neophyte however i resolved before diving into denis villeneuves newest release dune part two to finally remedy that this week ive been basking in dune through all its cinematic forms 1984 2021 theres so much to see and even more to try and understand dune part two hits theaters this week facing massive expectations critics are calling it one of the greatest scifi films of all time does the film live up to the cosmic hype or are there spicy takes in its future  dune part two jumps back into the continuing story of paul atreides timothée chalamet as he lands on arrakis he resolves to settle in with the local population rain vengeance down on those who wronged his family and then theres that whole thing about being the chosen one the film features a supersized allstar cast including zendaya rebecca ferguson javier bardem josh brolin austin butler florence pugh and dave bautista denis villeneuve directs dune part two from a script he cowrote with jon spaihts the film comes from frank herberts novel  after what can only be described as a spicy dune week kids yours truly was prepared to come in with some skepticism how can anything live up to the personality and lynchian wackiness of dune 1984 well it turns out denis villeneuve can  sometimes we have to admit when were wrong the proverbial hat must be eaten the hype is in fact real and at this point denis villeneuve is just showing off this film is a giant hans zimmerscored cinematic work of art the creative team does not put a foot wrong in telling this supersized and ambitious story and even more impressive they not only push but also shove the creative standard forward few franchises show the flawless visual mastery on display here villeneuve depicts a world that feels real the graphics and the effects never falter the characters move freely through the climate never limited by technology this world is vivid beautiful and fully realized in a way we dont often see  meanwhile the movie pulls together a packed cast of not only seasoned veterans but also some of the industrys best young talent there isnt a bad performance in the bunch of course wed be shirking our responsibilities if we didnt give special mention to timothée chalamet as paul the young actor has been lighting up the screen since his mainstream debut in 2017s call me by your name this time out however hes broken fully from the juvenile roles that have previously been his bread and butter chalamet is fully immersed in pauls dynamic and complicated intricacies theres a heartbreaking emotion here and a power and authority he hasnt often worked with in previous roles at the same time actor and director are fully united in the exploration of pauls ambiguity this is seen most strikingly in the third act one particular wordless scene shows this in terrifying clarity as chalamet not only dominates the frame but shows everything he can do with a single look so much is said without leaning on a single line of dialogue this silent power is in truth a commonality in dune part two as a filmmaker villeneuve is very much a practitioner of show dont tell this script is scant and leans heavily into these vivid worlds or equally striking performances to convey its message in the wrong hands this dense quiet beast of a movie could prove an insurmountable hurdle the film is pushing two hours and 40 minutes after all yet while this movie cant be called a breeze it never feels long and it never drags dune part two is allconsuming  this is one of those works where seeing this on as big a screen as possible is necessary dune part two loudly proclaims this in its marketing unfortunately theyre right this is a movie made for an imax screen its a big brash imax film when you factor in the hans zimmer score kids i could feel my bones vibrating thats power  when all is said and done this can only be described as an unapologetic rave this dune neophyte came into dune part two and was thrown for a loop in the best possible way director denis villeneuve jumps into what could easily be a bythebooks franchise sequel and creates a cinematic feast for the senses dune fans scifi fans and cinephiles alike should certainly have this one on their lists  a film nerd from my earliest years watching abbott and costello that eventually translated to a masters degree in film history i spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms as well as covering film and television

Apr 1 2024,positive, the scifi epic dune part two is rich in multilayered worldbuilding while its dense story might leave some cold this is a movie meant for bigscreen grandeur from the detailed costumes to the cinematography special effects and score set on a desert planet where a hallucinogenic spice sets warring factions against each other dune part two is a sight to behold especially in imax spice sparkles in the air above waves of sand dunes warriors face off in a blackandwhite arena while inkblot fireworks dot the sky a domed spaceship lays waste to a sacred tomb in a thunderous volley flames spill across a mirrored palace and a desert people thump a rhythm into the ground summoning giant sandworms for transportation and battle yet for all the filmmaking craft onscreen your mileage with the story may vary fans of frank herberts dune novels first published in 1965 no doubt will enjoy it others might have trouble keeping track of whos against whom or connecting emotionally with the narrative those who havent seen 2021s dune or read the books will find dune part two much like jumping into the middle seasons of game of thrones that said what returning director denis villeneuve and his team bring to the table is impressive the 2021 film picked up six oscars sound visual effects production design film editing cinematography and original score here that artistry again is striking with hans zimmers percussive score patrice vermettes production design and jacqueline wests intricate costumes particular standouts the script by villeneuve and returning cowriter jon spaihts picks up largely where the 2021 film left offand ends on an ambivalent note even after two hours and 46 minutes thankfully while the earlier film handled a lot of table setting this one dives right into the action unfurling at a brisk pace after the slaughter of his father and most of their supporters in the previous film paul timothée chalamet wonka and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson silo have become embedded with the fremen the desert people of the planet arrakis arrakis is the source of spice which the harkonnen family led on the ground by dave bautista the boy and the heron now mines having usurped pauls late father as governor power over spice is power over all a voice intones before the film even begins which is about as much backstory as dune part two allows the fremen led by stilgar javier bardem the little mermaid distrust outsiders and want the harkonnens gone theyve taken in paul and jessica because paul exhibits signs of being the prophesied leader for whom theyve waited centuriesa position that paul initially finds uncomfortable much of the dramatic tension comes from paul wanting to avenge his fathers death but being reluctant to take on the chosen one mantle chalamet plays paul with a believable sincerity happy to fight alongside the fremen and telling jessica they deserve to be led by one of their own  its not a prophecy its a story you keep telling as jessica ferguson is formidable her clipped tone and intense bearing more intimidating than the tattoos that adorn her face once she becomes the fremens reverend mother or religious leader as other women in her religious order the bene gesserit plot to create another heir the emperor christopher walken and his daughter irulan florence pugh oppenheimer discuss how to quash the fremen uprising meanwhile the pregnant jessica speaks with her developing fetus who in an otherworldly touch responds in voiceover pauls initial earnestness and scrappiness as a guerilla fighter against the harkonnens wins him the admiration of the fremen and the love of chani zendaya euphoria the two create a playful spark in early scenes such as when chani coaches paul how to walk across the sand without causing tremors that summon sandworms he contradicts her based on what hes read then realizes hes mansplaining to a native and apologizes the tugofwar over whether hell embrace his fate and just what that might be gives dune part two substance even if pauls decision ultimately feels abrupt among the other players in the allstar cast austin butler elvis is all forehead and no eyebrows as the sociopathic feydrautha a harkonnen set up as a foil for paul bardem earns several laughs with his sly delivery such as when stilgar notes that pauls humility is exactly what the foretold prophet would have the fremen though coded as middle eastern and north african still have few mena actors in prominent roles although souheila yacoub making of is a welcome and feisty addition as chanis friend shishakli valerie kalfrin is an awardwinning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at rogerebertcom in their own league script the hollywood reporter and other outlets also a screenwriter and script consultant shes passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability lets tell better stories and tell stories better
Mar 29 2024,positive, fritz lang george lucas ridley scott the lineage of great scifi directors is extensive but dune part two serves as an incredibly strong case to make the claim that villeneuve is the greatest of all time maximalist in every conceivable way the canadians latest offering is an absolute masterclass not only in space operas but also science fiction filmmaking itself 2021s dune part one set a rather high bar for itself but part two sent it into the stratosphere far above arrakis immediately picking up from the events of its predecessor part two has paul timothée chalamet and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson joining the ranks of stilgar javier bardem and chani zendaya members of the fremen desertdwelling arrakis natives survivors of the devastating attack upon house atreides by the brutish harkonnens paul and jessica are now exiles largely believed to be dead having overcome a harkonnen attack en route to the fremen settlement of sietch tabr mother and son are met with a mixture of suspicion and welcoming some believe them to be spies and others believe they are the fulfilment of a prophecy to free arrakis and to start a holy war their individual paths become clear paul is to embrace the fremen ways and lead them and jessica is to succeed the fremens dying reverend mother its here that the particularly islamic influence of prophetic religion upon herberts writing begins to take centre stage though is still partially diluted from its source material stilgar a native of the fundamentalist south rapidly becomes staunch in his belief that paul is the lisan al gaib the messianic figure as prophesied to his people representing the more sceptical fremen is chani a native of the north who joins others in not believing the prophecy with jessica having consumed the water of life she has inherited not only the mantle of reverend mother but also the memories of all her predecessors  as she points out to paul this traumatic ascension includes inheriting all of their tears pain and suffering undoubtedly anticipating the discourse that has since grown concerning cultural appropriation villeneuve delicately but directly tackles this through paul and jessicas selfinsertion into fremen culture jessicas manipulation of the fundamentalists through the implanted prophecy of the lisan al gaib is as skilful as it is sinister as is pauls militant ascent the bene gesserits presentation as a more outwardly nefarious entity we dont hope we plan provides genuine chills particularly helped along by charlotte ramplings marvellous performance as the stonyfaced reverend mother mohiam the display of religious fanaticism is critiqued in such a way that it isnt parodied for the sake of belittlement but rather approached as a product of external exploitation totally unforgettable are the performances of austin butler and stellan skarsgård their chemistry creating an utterly repulsive combination that is as sickening as it is menacing though he has relatively little screenplay butler elevates the movie to a new level his presence as the psychotic feydrautha shockingly enchanting dominating every scene in which he appears it seems uncontroversial to say that butlers feydrautha is one of the greatest villains in recent memory with recent critical failures from the mcu having cost upwards of 250 million whilst feeling like they cost a fraction of that a result not of untalented vfx artists but of unsustainable and punishing working conditions and turnarounds it makes dune part twos budget of 190 million all the more remarkable in every sense of the phrase dune part two is a visual marvel and a testament to it being a true labour of love by all who worked on it shot entirely in imax the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking the seemingly endless jordanian desert truly brings arrakis to life the sweeping sands looking positively vibrant and magically never appearing monochromatic with oscarwinning cinematographer powerhouse greig fraser zero dark thirty the batman the creator by his side villeneuve a deeply visual filmmaker in all respects has managed to create one of the most gorgeous films of the science fiction canon itself with few novels having gained such a devoted fanbase or having sold nearly as many copies as herberts 1965 original nitpicky comparisons to the source material have always been inevitable as was the case with part one and as testament to the sheer quality of part two few complaints have been voiced from even the most protective of fans its quite fair to say that the dune universe is one of the most difficult to adapt into any medium as has been demonstrated with previous entertaining but ultimately unsuccessful attempts  and yet its been adapted and adapted well  complexities nuances and all though some minor changes were made with the absence of thufir hawat being the most notable they dont detract from the quality as an adaptation or as a sequel in itself at risk of incurring the wrath of my fellow book fans id like to suggest that many of the minor changes improve upon the source material itself zendaya for example is refreshingly animated as chani a pleasant development from her stoic appearance at the climax of part one and of her literary counterpart as was the case with part one the pacing of part two is noticeably uneven making it feel slightly topheavy though not to its overall detriment for much of its 167minute runtime the action builds itself up slowly but surely teasingly incremental in its climb  but in its final act pauls story hurtles its way towards a thunderous earthshattering climax and then at its crescendo we finish a coital rhythm as its original visionary intended deliberately uneven but always growing and the payoff is worth it we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for

Mar 27 2024,positive, if you strolled into haslams book store on central avenue in st petersburg in 1965 among the new arrivals you might find on the shelves were kurt vonneguts god bless you mr rosewater rex stouts the doorbell rang irving stones those who love john le carrés the lookingglass war and ian flemings the man with the golden gun the 12th and final novel in the authors james bond series if you directed your attention to the science fiction section of the store you might also find some new offerings such as john brunners the martian sphinx kenneth bulmers land beyond the map philip k dicks the three stigmata of palmer eldritch avram davidsons masters of the maze andre nortons quest crosstime and of course frank herberts epic science fiction novel dune the true first edition of dune published by chilton books can fetch a pretty penny these days a first edition first printing copy signed and inscribed by the author sold for more than 22000 in a recent auction with the arrival of dune part two in theaters i would expect to see some collectors with deep pockets drive that figure even higher in the coming months even before the chilton books edition the tale had appeared in analog magazine divided into two separate serials the serials  presented as dune world and prophet of dune  were published in the magazine beginning in 1963 the author would go on to pen five sequels including dune messiah children of dune god emperor of dune heretics of dune and chapterhouse dune sounds like an expansive body of work for someone seeking to forge a new cinematic universe doesnt it but wait  theres more after frank herberts death his son brian herbert partnered with science fiction author kevin j anderson to continue the series since 1999 they have written more than a dozen additional novels including both prequels and sequels to the original books in dune part two director denis villeneuve continues his adaptation of frank herberts work the film is exquisitely beautiful and immersive breathtaking in scope and fearless in delivering stunning action sequences that are so vivid they practically erupt from the screen unlike the first installment this time villeneuve isnt saddled by the need to provide history lessons explaining the corrino imperium and the landsraad or focus energy on worldbuilding and chunky exposition the director is free to plunge headlong into the meat of the story boldly tackling themes of corrupt power ambiguous morality and the use of religion to control the course of society and manipulate the masses dune part two follows the mythic journey of paul muaddib atreides timothée chalamet as he finds sanctuary with the fremen who inhabit the desert planet arrakis paul and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson have secretly survived the fall of house atreides once they have been embraced by the fremen paul seeks revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family in doing so he will help liberate the fremen  some of whom consider him to be the lisan al gaib a fremen term for offworld messiah initially paul rejects the idea of being a savior and insists that he does not seek power paul sees the occupying harkonnen forces  led by rabban dave bautista  as their shared enemy and wishes only to fight alongside the fremen because he plays down any ideas of being the messiah he gains the trust of chani zendaya young and independent fremen warrior who gradually falls in love with paul eventually paul must choose between his relationship with chani and redirecting the fate of the known universe haunted by an apocalyptic future only he can foresee dune part two also features josh brolin as gurney halleck javier bardem as stilgar austin butler as feydrautha harkonnen stellan skarsgård as baron vladimir harkonnen florence pugh as princess irulan christopher walken as padishah emperor shaddam iv and charlotte rampling as gaius helen mohiam for dune part two the director wisely makes a few important changes to the original novel eliminating some characters downplaying others and significantly condensing the timeline the modifications are necessary cinematic adaptations of literary works require perceptive abridgement that does not compromise fidelity to the source material the film successfully captures  and in some regards enhances  all the principal themes found in herberts original work villeneuve imbues the film with antiimperialist imagery showing how colonizers plunder arrakis for their own benefit while treating the indigenous population with contempt and brutality  villeneuve also attempts to rectify one aspect of herberts novel by eliminating  or at least minimizing  the white savior trope many critics claim is integral in the source material the focus on pauls reluctance to claim the power his followers desperately want to bestow upon him is a crucial element of how the audience perceives the character chalamet effectively displays the characters gravitas and deep inner turmoil to the screen paul exhibits his disgust at lady jessicas hidden agenda and at the way the bene gesserit have directed and controlled bloodlines to maintain power  in a sense chani is on her own mythic journey villeneuves adaptation gives chani agency setting her up as a clear juxtaposition to the fundamentalists fanatical belief in paul as a messianic figure equally important is the fact that in dune part two paul could not have emerged as a leader without the support of both chani and stilgar at the beginning chani is suspicious but also curious about this boy coming from another world villeneuve explains in the films production notes something that deeply touches chani is that paul is sincere she feels that paul wants to learn about the fremen ways chani like other young fremen doesnt believe in the bene gesserit religious propaganda she believes that the fremen should be freed by fremen not wait for the arrival of some prophesied messiah  she thinks that those old beliefs are a way to control her people villeneuve adds but she sees that paul doesnt want to act as a colonizer he doesnt want to impose his ways he doesnt want to be seen as a savior whether or not villeneuves revisions to the source material go far enough to expunge any controversial motifs should be left to the individual viewer to decide the intent is certainly evident  dune part two exceeds expectations with repeated viewings it may prove to be the cinematic masterpiece many have already claimed it is boasting remarkably rich and nuanced storytelling captivating political and religious conspiracies a brilliant score by composer hans zimmer and passionate performances from a superlative cast the film is a sweeping operatic science fiction spectacle lee clark zumpe is entertainment editor at tampa bay newspapers a tomatometerapproved critic and an author of short fiction appearing in select anthologies and magazines follow lee at 
Mar 26 2024,positive,dune part two is bigger in almost every way the visual effects sound design and production as a whole is immaculate narratively it does feel a bit too unresolved by the end for my taste but hopefully dune messiah comes sooner rather than later
Mar 24 2024,positive, denis villenueves  mythic scifi sequel dune part two has already grossed 500 million globally making it the highestgrossing film of 2024  domestic and worldwide  surpassing the first film released back in 2021 based on frank herberts antiimperial ecologically dystopian dune saga it revolves around paul timothee chalamet heir to the house of atreides wiped out in part one under the fascist aegis of grotesque genocidal baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgard as with any franchise seeing the first installment is vital to understanding the second in the year 10191 paul is hiding out on the vast desert planet arrakis where he joins forces with the rebellious indigenous fremen earning the respect of their wry religious elder stilgar javier bardem and forming an attachment to feisty chani zendaya as they defiantly wage guerilla warfare against house harkonnen meanwhile his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson with her preborn fetus gulps down the water of life a clear blue liquid that looks like mouthwash that elevates her to exalted status of reverend mother within the fremens secretive matriarchal religious group bene gesserit at the center of the conflict is a rare commodity called spice mélange an addictive drug known for its powerful psychotropic powers and prescience an ability to see into the past present  future in smell and taste its like cinnamon because of their constant spice exposure all fremen have radiant blue eyes new characters include the evil emperor christopher walken his daughter princess irulan florence pugh pugnacious feydrautha harkonnen austin butler and lady margot lea seydoux pregnant with feydrauthas child among the most memorable sequences are when chani teaches paul how to sandwalk adroitly avoiding rhythmic patterns in the arid terracotta colored desert that would alert sandworms when paul is reunited with atreides weapon master gurney halleck josh brolin and when paul and the fremen mount those giant sandworms for a climactic battleconcluding with the war has just begun written by villeneuve and jon spaihts with an emphasis on action  as opposed to exposition and characterdevelopment  this shallow selfimportant sequel runs 2 hours 46 minutes dominated by grieg frasers spectacular cinematography and hans zimmers propulsive score on the granger gauge of 1 to 10 dune part two is a visually stunning yet sterile 6  teasing an inevitable part three in years to come
Mar 24 2024,positive,if you are watching dune part two with the right mindset ie from chanis point of view you should be watching the film with growing dread and concerned about paul not cheering how everything is coming together 
Mar 22 2024,positive,as different from the first film as ridley scotts alien is to james camerons aliens same stuff totally different genre 
Mar 21 2024,positive,dune is a stunning sweeping epic with a cast in command of their roles  part two really cements dune as one of our greatest modern examples of epic genre worldbuilding
Mar 20 2024,positive, otta know what happens this very second finish allowing time to take it all in and practice patience before dune 3 comes along so as i wrote before i personally expect to continue demonstrating that required patience  after all i qualify as a fan since i once named a blueeyed calico cat alia after a dune character who i hope to meet more thoroughly in the next installment
Mar 18 2024,positive, once in a while a sweeping saga masterpiece comes along such as 1977s star wars retroactively retitled star wars episode iv  a new hope by george lucas or peter jacksons the lord of the rings trilogy 20012003 or james camerons 2009 avatar dune part two is most definitely in the same league it not only continues the brilliance of the first film it sets a new bar for just how good scifi films should be with an engaging story and a cast at their very best along with stunning visuals this is a masterpiece as with the oscarwinning first installment villeneuve shows visual mastery of scale and scope along with impressive cinematography viewing the film in an imax theater with dolby sound brought back memories of the prior films listed above as a result i recommend seeing it on the most giant screen possible based on frank herberts idolized scifi novel some have said the movie could never be made due to the books complexities and the visual science fiction effects im here to tell you its been done as director dennis villeneuve has succeeded in a colossal way part two follows the journey of paul atreides timothee chalamet very closely after the first one ends as he unites with chani zendaya and the fremen who are not free men hes also on a path of revenge against those who destroyed his family with the help of a fremen tribal leader named stilgar javier bardem who is convinced that paul is the chosen one stilgar believes the mythology points to paul as the savior the emo king paul tries to blend with the fremen forming a relationship with a young warrior named chani he passes several tests given by the fremen he takes the tribal name of muaddib vowing vengeance against the harkonnens for control of arrakis and revenge for his fathers death during the combat scenes watching bodies fall from the sky as colossal ships burst into flames appears virtually like an opera when looking at a films style as rabban harkonnen dave bautista is a wartime leader whose situation has exceeded his abilities while stellan skarsgard has shades of jabba the hutt i also enjoyed bautistas performance as he dug deep into the role and it is eerily believable youll feel immersion into vast worlds of endless sand that are only traveled with precise movements also in a parallel scene on another planet emperor shaddam iv christopher walken and his daughter a princess irulan florence pugh speak with bene gesserits reverend mother charlotte rampling about the state of affairs irluan provides voiceover or narration to keep audiences up to speed on what is happening you may be wondering about austin butlers psychopath role as feydrautha the evil villain and the star of the movies most haunting set the harkonnens home planet of giedi prime shown in nearly all black and white with infrared imagery theres a gladiatorstyle stadium that serves as an arena for maintaining his champion status as a butcherer of druggedup prisoners baron vladimir harkonnen the ultraevil humongous blob tests his worth by sending former atreides soldiers to fight again all of butlers scenes are filmed in black and white delivering the feeling of everlasting doom and horror hes the sociopathic nephew of the baron who gives a realistic organic performance i enjoyed seeing all of the famous stars in the film timothée chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson austin butler josh brolin stellan skarsgård dave bautista javier bardem and florence pugh are all fantastic in their roles ultimately chalamet is the most transformed taking on his new role of a leader with some surprises along the way he rises to the occasion speaking with astute confidence and determination his transformation and stellar acting are exciting to view as paul chooses between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe as he attempts to prevent a horrific future that only he can foresee on a side note i was invited to a zoom press conference with director denis villeneuve and found it very insightful especially when he was asked about the epic scope of the film yet keeping the emotional heartbeat he replied its everything epic and the action and that is not something that is that difficult to do the thing that is difficult to do is to make sure that we dont lose focus on the intimate relationship more precisely the story between paul and chani thats the heartbeat its like their relationship will unfold all drama of the film through the eyes of chani and paul we feel the political pressure the cultural pressure the oppression i really constructed the movie focused on the tension between them i knew that and i kept saying to my crew if we dont believe in their relationship we dont have a movie and that was my main focus during the whole shoot to take care and to be as close to them as possible if you havent seen dune part one id suggest watching that first as most of the characters are set up especially paul and his familys transition you will be blown away by dune part 2 as it reminds you that a broadscale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair you may also have flashbacks to other masterpieceepic films of the past
Mar 18 2024,positive, directorwriter denis villeneuve along with his cast and crew had a lot to live up to with dune part two the first installment of villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts seminal scifi novel was a rousing critical and financial success massive in every sense of the word an imaxsized spectacle about destiny and faith charting political machinations across galaxies and even with a riveting comingofage arc and thrilling set pieces dune part one merely set up this pivotal sequel  surprising nobody this is a technical masterpiece when viewed in imaxs taller aspect ratio the visuals are simply gorgeous showing off the beauty and enormity of this severe yet beautiful universe with monochromatic sequences set on the harkonnens home planet especially standing out cinema hasnt felt this epic since the lord of the rings trilogy expertly staged setpieces and battles offer genuine thrills and rich fascinating worldbuilding yet dune part two drops the ball in other areas its lack of introspection leaving many viewers cold picking up immediately after its predecessor house atreides is no more after the harkonnens massacre on arrakis and paul timothée chalamet heads deeper into the desert with the fremen to learn their ways staying faithful to herberts book this isnt your typical good versus evil story but a stark warning on how faith can be weaponised by colonists its fairly obvious from the start how the narrative will play out but that seems to be by design pauls dark ascension to becoming a prophesied leader unfolds like a car crash in slow motion impossible to take your eyes away from  lady jessica rebecca ferguson once again plays a key role in pauls development and her arc is fascinating to watch she too heads down a dark path as jessica becomes an influential religious figure and convinces the fundamentalists among the nomadic group of fremen that her son is the lisanalgaiba messiah who will lead the people to freedom and paradise although her goal is to aid paul in his journey jessicas cunning plans to change the fremens perceptions and force a prophecy into existence make for compelling storylines particularly with fergusons delightfully unnerving performance its a shame then that most of jessicas work takes place off screen  the most memorable character in the film however is chani zendaya unlike in part one she finds substantial screen time that drives the narrative even when she solely acts as pauls love interest at the start chani undergoes a satisfying arc serving as a counterpoint to the films examination of messianic worship she regularly questions the idea of fate as well as pauls motives all while proving herself to be a capable fighter and survivor new women introduced to the cast include princess irulan florence pugh and lady margot léa seydoux the intelligent princess irulan plays political games as the emperors daughter but she doesnt have much screen time and only discusses matters involving paul similarly lady margot is a devious sister of the bene gesserit a womenonly group who control the direction of humanity from the shadows but lady margots limited scenes are spent tricking a man into impregnating her for the sisterhoods breeding programme  the bene gesserit are such an intriguing part of dunes lore and in dune part two the different members do share scenes that highlight how their own creations and plans have backfired with disastrous results ultimately though this is pauls story and the film sidelines the powerfuland far more interestingsisterhood whilst its nice to finally have a bigger focus on the fremen after only supporting parts in the first film it still doesnt change the questionable choices made with casting zendaya and javier bardem a multiracial american and a spanish actor respectively still occupy the roles of people that are clearly coded as middle eastern and north african mena or west asia and north african wana for example the fremens language employs arabic phrases such as lisanalgaib and mauddib making it clear where inspiration lies yet mena actors are simply used to fill the background we finally see more of the fremens culturetheir community spaces and rites of passagebut not enough to truly get an understanding of their people outside of aspects that are tied to the immediate story this surfacelevel exploration along with the fact the director and writers are all white men lead to an orientalist interpretation handwaved as science fiction while clearly telegraphing mena cultures and people  in fact dune part twos exploration of the white savior had its detractors with some saying villeneuve glorifies the concept yes paul a white man is taking on the mantle of the fremens messiah and yes his mother jessica appropriates their clothing and culture but this is all part of the original books critique of white saviorism where villeneuve and his writers fail isnt in their portrayals of this key conceptits by underwriting the fremen here they are desertdwellers with capable fighters ululating women and strong believers in destined leadersand nothing more  also worth noting is how all of the key new characters are white dune part one had a somewhat diverse cast particularly within house atreides but with jason momoas duncan idaho and chang chens dr yueh being killed off this sequel feels whitewashed from bene gesserit sisters to harkonnens to the emperors family the expanded roster of characters could have been more inclusive instead the film squanders this easy opportunity  dune part two improves upon its predecessor thanks to a bigger focus on the fremen but the representation is still watered down furthermore shallow writing and choppy editing issues prevent this from being a modern classic if villeneuve and company finally give mena actors and the fremen culture the spotlight in the inevitable third film then itll surely stand as the masterful adaptation theyre striving for
Mar 17 2024,positive, the criticallyacclaimed science fiction epic returned with dune part two on march 1 director denis villeneuves first dune was met with critical acclaim in 2021 taking home six of its 10 oscar nominations dune part two is already speculated to shake up the academy awards again after nearly doubling the first films box office numbers part two collected 815 million during its opening weekend while part one opened to 41 million the associated press reported march 4 becoming the first majorearner of 2024 and a personal record breaker for its director villeneuves dune is the third screen adaptation of frank herberts 1965 novel of the same name following david lynchs 1984 film and john harrisons 2000 miniseries timothée chalamet reprises his role as the messianic paul atreides who reunites with chani and the fremen people of desert planet arrakis to wage war against the opposing house harkonnen zendaya rebecca ferguson josh brolin stellan skarsgård dave bautista charlotte rampling and javier bardem all return as their characters in part one theyre joined by florence pugh christopher walken and léa seydoux plus a nearlyunrecognizable austin butler and a surprise cameo from anya taylorjoy the film was greenlit by warner bros and legendary in october 2021 after part ones success with filming taking place between july and december 2022 originally scheduled for release on nov 3 2023 it was pushed back to march 15 2024 due to the sagaftra and wga strikes and later moved up two weeks to march 1 we worked very hard to be ready for that original date but we very much felt that especially with this incredible cast that it was worth waiting for mary parent  a producer on both films and chairman of worldwide production at legendary  told ap  vocalo resident film critic reggie the reel critic ponder called the film a heroic tale worthy of the bigscreen experience pointing out that while chalamet commands the screen the actors surrounding him truly make the film stand out dune part two will engross you in its beauty and complexity yet it might confuse you at the same time ponder said if you didnt quite like part one you will like this  and if you liked part one you will love part two
Mar 15 2024,negative, denis villeneuves return to arrakis promises much but in some ways it must as spectacular as 2021s dune was it essentially stopped midstory in the hope of the filmmakers paymasters extending the canvas dune part two improves on its predecessor in some crucial ways but the reliance on spectacle leaves gaps in the storytelling and a frustratingly ephemeral interest in the most interesting ideas the film brings forward the film picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous instalment with the family and great house of paul atreides timothée chalamet slaughtered on our last visit to the desert planet arrakis he finds himself ascending to messianic status amongst the native fremen people a seed planted by his mothers religious cult the bene gesserit and seeking revenge for his familys massacre at the behest of baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård backed by the emperor christopher walken pauls developing relationship with chani zendaya  sceptical of the prophecy of a saviour lisan algaib which paul seemingly embodies  provides a counterweight to the meddling of his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson as paul battles with whether to seize the power he could as a religious figurehead a new foe comes to the fore in feydrautha harkonnen austin butler a ruthless and psychotic replacement as the coordinator of the harkonnen campaign on arrakis the scope of dune part two is sweeping in both visual and thematic terms and if the above summary seems abrupt to those familiar with frank herberts books it is because it would be easy to get lost in the mythology of even this condensed version of his work on the visual front whatever viewers and critics wrote about the spectacle of dune applies to its sequel villeneuves vision remains writ large its possible to argue greig frasers cinematography here is less impactful and blander than dune or the batman still imaginative visuals such as the otherworldly desaturation of the harkonnen home world or the use of blue to penetrate past the browns and tans of arrakis show the film still has a few tricks up its sleeve zendayas performance balancing vulnerability as pauls romantic partner fearlessness as a fighter and scepticism as a lisan algaib doubter give the film an emotional core that was achingly absent before additionally chalamet gives one of his more impressive performances to date as paul slowly starts to give in to the leadership expectations and hopes of others there is a wideeyedness to his performance that chalamets harsher critics with this critic guilty as charged likely did not expect ferguson is engaging as lady jessica but the abundant screen time for those with truncated roles in dune represents the films most significant improvement from part one zendayas chani is given time to be sketched out in a way not many other characters are  including protagonist paul zendayas performance balancing vulnerability as pauls romantic partner fearlessness as a fighter and scepticism as a lisan algaib doubter give the film an emotional core that was achingly absent before javier bardems stilgar also puts forward an earnestness with his religious fervour and hope for a saviour which puts a bitter sting in the darker aspects of pauls role as messiah with all this said despite some visual cues and explicit script signalling points that signal the more dystopian aspects of pauls rise to power its hard to escape the feeling that reading this in dune part two as a film is extratextual and instead based on the direction of the dune novels which followed the ones adapted here there are a lot of ideas introduced and skirted over  as in part one  around colonial exploitation white saviour tropes demagoguery religions role in authoritarian systems and more however few are given time to develop within the confines of a subthreehour film and subsixhour pair perhaps this isnt surprising but probably illustrates the core problem with both instalments and dune part two in particular the sheer scope defies conceptual neatness its remarkable a blockbuster film can even seek to introduce some of the themes it does but that ambition makes it more frustrating that it paints a broad and spectacular canvas with no interest in going deeper or perhaps no ability to in contrast denis villeneuves previous scifi forays did possess the conceptual neatness required to communicate underlying ideas effectively arrivals wedding of unique alien language and imagery to reimagine the human understanding of our lives is a simple emotional hook on an engaging set of mechanics blade runner 2049 provides a visually stunning and emotionally resonant extension of a simple human aspect of the 1982 original the direct inspirations for dune or things inspired by the novel depending on your viewpoint and things almost explicitly evoked such as star wars and gladiator have greater fleetness of foot and simplicity of plot dune part two obviously aims for a different tone than those and its remarkable a blockbuster film can even seek to introduce some of the themes it does but that ambition makes it more frustrating that it paints a broad and spectacular canvas with no interest in going deeper or perhaps no ability to this entry leans more heavily on the religious and autocratic readings of pauls rise amongst the fremen however without much weight behind it said leaning doesnt leave a deep impression its heartening that a film of this scope  in all senses  can exist in the modern cinematic canon however as engaging and aweinducing as it can be the rush of sensory input distracts from the fact it has only a passing interest in engaging the audiences critical faculties with its characters dune part two resolves one of the major flaws with dune  its emotional dryness  but neglects to use that renewed zeal to meaningfully deepen any of the main ideas introduced across either part one thing the two modern dune films show if sparingly is that one persons lisan algaib is anothers oppressor in waiting the film itself can also have dual identities and how you resolve the balance between breathtaking extravaganza and frustratingly limited melange marks out whether you end up a true believer or a cinematic agnostic
Mar 15 2024,positive, clocking in at a substantial two hours and 46 minutes the highly anticipated sequel to dune proves to be a captivating and daring work that surpasses its predecessor it stands as a pure marvel leaving audiences speechless with cinematic qualities bound to linger long after the credits roll  directed with ferocity by denis villeneuve the film pushes the envelope with its gripping dark atmosphere suspenseful hunts and ambushes intricate rituals and prophecies psychedelic imagery and exhilarating fights set against magnificent backdrops  in this grandiose adaptation of frank herberts adventurous saga paul atreides portrayed with compelling depth by timothée chalamet joins forces with the fremen tribe confirming his role as the prophesied leader they have been awaiting his journey includes daunting challenges such as riding a giant sandworm  a scene described by the director as the most complex he has ever filmed  and facing off against the sadistic baron vladimir hakkonen stellan skarsgard and his ambitious and ruthless nephew feydrautha austin butler amidst these trials paul also finds love with the rebellious fremen warrior chani zendaya but their relationship is threatened by the uncertain fate of the universe while the film boasts elaborate storytelling it never veers into indulgence the incorporation of abstraction amidst its dense layers adds depth while still delivering all the impact one would expect from a breathtaking scifi adventure hans zimmers ominous gothic score further heightens the intensity of each scene contributing to the films overall strength dune part 2 stands as the apotheosis of villeneuves directorial signature within the scifi genre  a tremendous display of fullthrottle filmmaking that mesmerizes with its clever stylization unwavering attention to detail and grandiose visuals sit back relax and immerse yourself in this unmissable epic space opera
Mar 14 2024,negative, dune part two is not a sequel but a continuation of dune so picks up exactly at the point youd started to wonder if it would ever end all i can remember from the first film is sand sand so much sand and it must get everywhere and into your sandwiches but it is set in a massive desert so it goes without saying there would be a lot of sand i dont blame the sand especially directed by denis villeneuve and based on the series of books by frank herbert this second outing has already been hailed as thrilling breathtaking and a masterpiece by those who are too easily carried away and said the same of the marvel films  although im glad to say they are coming round to my way of thinking to summarise where we were when we were praying for the last film to end we were on the inhospitable desert planet of arrakis which is famed for its rare and extremely valuable resource spice when the emperor shifted control of arrakis from house harkonnen to house atreides it set off a conflict between the two families after duke leto atreides was murdered his heir paul timothée chalamet and pauls mother jessica rebecca ferguson fled into the desert where they found sanctuary with the planets indigenous people the fremen here we now discover paul does not plan to become an aromatherapist and develop his own brand of oils even if id like to see that instead he plans to retake arrakis and avenge the death of his father it is a heros personal quest story even if we know from the getgo there are prophecies that paul will survive and also that even if he doesnt comprehend his destiny yet he is the kwisatz haderach the saviour there are all sorts of allegories at play im not paid enough to think about them the set pieces  the battle scenes the stadium scenes the sandworms thrashing their way to the surface like the shark in jaws  are swaggeringly spectacular but hardly suspenseful as the victors are a foregone conclusion the noise of it meanwhile is so earsplitting that the sound travels up your legs and vibrates your coccyx i am still throbbing overall the good characters are insanely good while the bad characters are monstrously bad  and also bald like baron harkonnen stellan skarsgard and his nephew feydrautha austin butler the cast is stacked with celebs aside from those already mentioned we have florence pugh léa seydoux anya taylorjoy zendaya and javier bardem i find that i resent how excellent actors who could be doing interesting work get swallowed up by these films chalamet was an interesting actor once there is little character development and its not for the literalminded  or anyone who has despite their best efforts paid some attention werent we told that no nonarrakan would survive without wearing a still suit to recycle moisture so why are they now doing without where have the fremens bright blue eyes gone why five hours into the franchise have we never seen anyone take spice so we may properly understand its psychotropic properties how do you even imbibe it also as jessica is a member of the bene gesserit a mysterious sisterhood and has trained paul in the voice which when used will command others to do his bidding why doesnt he just command the harkonnen to put down their arms because as my son who is a fan told me there would be no story then it is purely about what its about which is power who has it who doesnt who wants it i kept thinking things like what do people eat around here i cant say i can only say that if my family had ended up on arrakis my dad would be saying i want all that sand off you before you step foot in this car
Mar 14 2024,positive,denis villeneuve is the director of this massive undertaking also on board here is composer hans zimmer with his unforgettable background music and greig fraser as the cinematographer who gets those gigantic sand worms into action
Mar 14 2024,positive, dune part two is a towering achievement in almost every way that is quantifiable joining the growing list of scifi epics where the sequel outpaces an already heralded original the majority of this review will be the ways it accomplishes this with a few but noteworthy amounts of criticisms that keep it from being perfect but i didnt want to bury the lead in stating how great the film itself is because i couldnt really write this review without acknowledging the films release thematic framing in our real world and the behavior of its performers in recent months i am a big dune fan and i say that as a fan of the books that once believed them to be impossible to adapt faithfully i enjoyed denis villeneuves initial entry and all of his films honestly and really really looked forward to how he would adapt the second half of the first book in the sequel but i cant wont pretend to ignore the world of dune and the climate of the real world the movies sequel crystalized in the largest controversy being timothee chalamets skit on snl and which hamas was used as a punchline in what was essentially the early days of this specific violent eruption that had already killed thousands and thousands of innocent palestinians  i have my skepticisms about the impact of celebrities role in global narratives in general and often feel that propaganda has more power to entrench people in their already established beliefs more often then it sways someone from one side to another i know internet outrage machines usually depend on every action someone takes in the public eye as some huge factor in what happens all over the world but i typically have a hard time getting on board with that so in a vacuum i think chalamets joke and the snl writers were in extremely bad taste and does demonstrate their lack of care and empathy they had for the palestinian people and lets keep this a buck probably for brown and black people all over but im not mad at people for still wanting to watch a movie that said person stars in though i dont fault folks that will protest it either what is enduring to me is the plot of dune and how we often learn so little from the art we create the elevator pitch for dune is that in the far future a once privileged son of noble birth has his family and house obliterated but finds refuge with the indigenous people of a planet foreign to him believing him to be their messiah he manipulates that population to fighting their oppressors not for their benefit but for his and knowing his actions will lead to the literal deaths of billions across the galaxy he still follows through because of his primary short term and personal goal there are much better analogies in film to the gaza conflict the last of us 2 comes to mind though i dont love the portrayals in that one either but the oppression of a population living on a desired land often referred to rats in the film is a bit hard to ignore unless youre in film and its a job and you can treat art with themes based on real life like you dont live in that real world too its dispiriting and numbing honestly to see separating the art from the artist not only as a mantra for people that want to ignore the politics of art but for it to basically become the gospel maybe i am the parental figure of the movies i watch now im not mad im just disappointed anyways dune part two as a film is a technical achievement on the levels of cinema that im not sure ive seen in live action every scene is jaw dropping to witness typically big budget films have a signature action scene that will live in the zeitgeist for years to come dune part two has about 4 that i can think of immediately emotionally impactful moments linger in closeup on characters that amplifies the weight of their decisions their actions their connections to one another the scale is appropriate as well the desert is a character in itself stretching on forever in each shot the camera often pulled well behind the characters to demonstrate the endlessness of the landscape and anyone that sees the film will obviously point to the use of black and white when the movie arrives on the geidi prime the harkonnen homeworld and it not only makes the violence even more daunting and disturbing but it gives a sense of that nuance here is lost and the agendas and goals of these people are straightforward often to the most ruthless ends as for the plot the movie takes place right after the events of the first film with paul atreides and his lady jessica seeking refuge among the fremen of arrakis but still being hunted harkonnen who want to eradicate the atreides house as the film progresses paul played by chalamet slowly embraces the false prophecies his mother and the benet jesuit have planted among the fremen people even if he was reluctant at first because of the death and destruction he knows it will bring the pacing is well done obviously easier to do in a film of this length as there are plenty of victories losses tragedies and revelations that guide paul down this irreversible path because the first dune book was written 60 years ago and because pauls story itself takes about 3 books to fully tell ill make what may be an unpopular opinion in 2024 paul atreides is one of the most fascinating protagonists written in fiction period he is no hero not by a long shot  after the first film released i know several people were just out on it because it looked like yet again another white savior leading the brown folks to the promised land and because the film only adapts the first half if that of the book i dont think that was a completely wrong assumption to make but paul is not a white savior hes actually the opposite hes a harbinger of doom evil is perhaps to flat a term to assign to him but i think you can make a great case that for the early parts of the fiction paul is a villain opposing greater villains dune is about many things but one was about the cautioning towards the grips of fanatic religious fervor and the danger of charismatic leaders paul being an outsider to these people and using their yearning of hope against them to help accomplish his goal of revenge are not supposed to make you root for paul and for those that checked out of the first film i really hope you see the sequel because that specific vision becomes much more clear and on display admittedly while the performances are all good defaulting as great the progression of the supporting characters is a bit more up and down for me zendaya as chani is good mostly though the expansion of her character for the movie seems to be driven more by it being zendaya in the role needing a foil to paul as the fanaticism grows i think many of the character missteps in the film are often to fill the void of an important character not being there compared to the books but asking chani to be the love interest the guide companion to paul the heart of the fremen people and ultimately the foil and victim to pauls endgame machinations are just a bit too much to pack into one character especially for a character that didnt do 20 of that in the book  in a different way lady jessica takes on a more nefarious role as the lead propagandist for pauls accension to fremen messiah jessica is already a polarizing figure by design so to see her only role in the film to be the carnival barker for paul even when he tells her how tragic this path will be was a little disappointing plus they got her using the voice on ayebody like once per her 2 minutes of screen time and it got to be a bit much the other incredible scene stealing performance belonged to austin butler as the absolutely psychotic feydrautha he is essentially the mirror of paul if he were raised in a brutal and homicidal environment that had no love or empathy in the social charter your boy really exorcised them elvis demons he is impossible not to gawk at on screen and i often found myself thinking the most terrible thing possible that a character can do he will absolutely do it before this scene is over the very big omission from the film that was present in the book is pauls little sister alia in the book she is already born and little more than a toddler by the books end but because of lady jessica drinking the water of life while pregnant that toddler alia contains all the knowledge of her ancestors and is basically reverend mother in a three yearolds body for the film however alia is still in utero while she is still a character technically talking to lady jessica and being involved in the plotting she still doesnt have the impact she had in the books that puts pressure on characters like jessica and even chani in some respects to be either opposing forces to paul or help set paul higher on the overall morality scale of the dune characters alia via the books is just as cunning but even more brutal and pragmatic than her brother which is hinted at in the movie but will most likely be explored fully in dune messiah  as a whole the performances and plotting of the characters never relents and almost everything has a good logic system behind it only with chani did i not always have a clear vision of what they wanted or have that feeling in movies where people do things because they havent had some basic conversations that would help them make better decisions dune part two is a movie that feels like the culmination of everything that can make a big epic story like this great on the big screen it is one of the most gorgeous films ive ever seen whether during the iconic action sequences or the unnerving rituals of the varying groups on the planet the performances range from amazing to adequate the latter never truly taking away from the spectacle we are witnessing i have to imagine that dune messiah will be the last film and if its done as well as part two was gives it a chance at being one of the best scifi trilogies every made you dont want the fourth book children of dune yall im trying to warn you i love dunebut you dont want that shit b is the most factual thing you will read on the internet today horrendous 
Mar 14 2024,neutral, it was nice being a denis villeneuve fan again for a few years but with dune part two the inconsistent filmmaker is back to his misguided ways the brief respite of blade runner 2049 and dune part one suggested that he was meant for highconcept scifi after the pretentiousness of arrival sicario and prisoners  solid genre entries undermined by empty quests for importance  sidelined him from the weird heights of enemy and the gutpunch brilliance of incendies in the elevated surroundings of futuristic los angeles and the planets of caladan giedi prime and arrakis villeneuves lofty concepts thrillingly found a home and while one might think the spectacle of dune part one would increase on the way to a big climax in the continuation of his frank herbert adaptation with the exception of a few slick scifi images part two may as well take place in nearfuture albuquerque tonally inconsistent this second chapter rarely feels like a villeneuve film  even the aforementioned visually sharp narrative misfires minimal distinguishable style is evident in the films excruciatingly long opening stretch with paul atreides timothée chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson entrenched with the indigenous fremen on the desert planet arrakis and the random point at which the narrative resumes makes the already awkward end of part one feel doubly arbitrary though doubts remain among the native people regarding his and jessicas presence paul has suddenly been accepted by most of the fremen resulting in a cringey folksy familiarity with them and the way he and love interest chani zendaya wear each other down with their mutually long flirty looks grows old fast especially with little evidence to support her attraction to him the two actors have been stellar in plenty of other films but its doubtful that any pair of performers could convincingly pull off this weak romantic material the distinct change in narrative quality may or may not be due to part one coscribe eric roth being dropped from the screenwriting team as in his absence villeneuve and collaborator jon spaihts spin their wheels with the fremen and take forever  besides a brief introduction of princess irulan florence pugh and her father the emperor christopher walken  to work in anyone else when they do its merely a minute of the pathetic beast rabban dave bautista roiding out over the harkonnens inability to stifle the desert rat insurgents rather than continue part ones invigorating blend of stunning imagery and engaging informative world and mythbuilding part two quickly devolves into long dramatic stares the movie with the filmmakers lacking faith in their storytelling after such a promising opening gambit the continuation becomes almost zack snyderlike in its iconography  lazy solutions that villeneuve has only occasionally flirted with in his worst films such cheap well not in a financial sense tricks are perhaps to be expected when the storytellers wholly succumb to the sagas fanatical religious elements which quickly become onenote  particularly the laughable insistence of stilgar javier bardem that paul is fulfilling ancient prophecies and proving himself the messianic kwisatz haderach pauls embrace of this role plays out somewhat clumsily as chalamet proves illsuited for the big emotional outbursts that accompany pauls rise to power but again the likes of daniel daylewis and denzel washington would probably struggle to be taken seriously in this role with filmmakers who seem in a rush to reach the end and continually brush past what feels like important information likewise running counter to the measured storytelling of part one this strangely zippy plotting appears primarily to set up a climactic showdown between paul and feydrautha harkonnen austin butler elvis a character not even mentioned in the previous film and whose introduction proves predictably forced  playing yet another famous performer with a weird voice butler is serviceable in the role memorably inhabited by sting in david lynchs dune and elicits decent excitement in his birthday gladiator arena sequence as his insane uncle baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård looks on but the decision to film this stretch primarily in bw is a strange one and draws too much attention to itself with minimal underlying intent tossed around like an offworlder attempting to ride a sand worm one grows tired of practically everyone except walken and pugh in part because they havent been given enough time to grow dull however such opportunities await as like its predecessor part two is mere prelude to further adventures with paul  co it didnt seem to be the case after the immense potential of part one but in all its awkwardness the 40yearold lynch version remains the definitive bigscreen adaptation of dune
Mar 14 2024,positive, one of the most enduring critiques of 2021s dune is of its perceived sparseness labeling the once unfilmable adaptation as a gorgeously engineered juggling act of frank herberts lugubrious mythmaking thats all setup and no payoff a true part one if there ever was one nearly three years later however denis villeneuves staggering dune part two proves to land every spectacular brutalist tableau thrown in the air in 2021 the first films meticulous  and at times exhausting  assembly of dynastic lore and tangled history kept its characters in the shadows of its sprawling grandeur but part two completes a vision by colliding dense scifi imagemaking with herberts heady and prescient themes the gravity of manufactured destiny the untamable tendrils of belief and a harrowing subversion of the heros journey discarding the first films mysterious undulating prelude for a new caption part two lets us know its getting straight to business power over spice is power over all taking place precisely where 2021s dune left off part two finds paul atreides timotheé chalamet in top form and his mother lady jessica a sinister rebecca ferguson on the run with the planets native fremen with his father dead and house atreides grip on arakeen shattered by sadistic house harkonnen rivals paul acclimates to his freedom fighter hosts while growing his romance with fellow rebel chani zendaya fremen leader stilgar javier bardem is eager to accept the prodigal atreides as the prophesied lisan al gaib to deliver his people from harkonnen oppression but unbeknownst to the indigenous faithful jessica  as a bene gesserit priestess  has carefully massaged eugenics and thousands of years of local myth to suit her son and her sect  the world has made choices for us late in dune part two chani unearths its central tension as the two lovers try and resist the pull of destiny where dune ends on an almost comically truncated cliffhanger villeneuve is now ready to detonate all the foundations conscientiously crafted three years ago catalyzing herberts stark palace intrigue with the tragedy of inevitability part two examines colonial conquest messianic dangers and the gravity of mass belief systems the role of faith  and its meaning to different factions  is woven straight into the tapestry of the narrative for the fremen lisan al gaib is the savior foretold for the bene gesserit its a system of control and a tool of subjugation and what of paul himself hopped up on arrakis otherworldly spice and the psychic powers it endows him the young duke  channeled through chalamets careerbest performance  precariously wavers between his own horror at the tyrannical future hes locked into and the intoxicating allure of empyrean power dune has had a long pained history on the screen alejandro jodorowskys version remains an abandoned production and a hollywood relic david lynchs ambitiously incomprehensible 1984 film resulted in a notorious flop and the 2000 miniseries  the bloated and faithfultoafault frank herberts dune  has the dubious honor from torcom as the most okay adaptation dune  by sheer number of failed iterations  has been called unfilmable but its reputation as an impenetrable esoteric art object has been greatly exaggerated leafing through herberts prose its quite clear that theres plenty of dune that is inherently cinematic and villeneuve  whose staunchest critics find him cold and clinical  is the perfect choice to bring arrakis and its galactic oppressors to life not to throw around the word lightly but part two is rife with suretobe iconic scifi imagery borne from dp greig frasers stunning compositions harkonnen troopers in an antigravity assault through the sands of the spice planet the black sun and inverted fireworks of giedi prime the dementedyethonorable feydrauthas a slithering committed austin butler gladiatorial showdowns part two also has villeneuve shoring up his kinetic bonafides a midfilm guerilla takedown of an ornithopter had the audience in my theater hollering and for those who spent three years patiently waiting for some real sandworm action im happy to report that dunes most infamous cryptids make multiple jawdropping appearances  villeneuve as a long time dunehead has called his adaptation the project of his life conveying an exuberant passion for the source material his deep understanding of herberts ideas shine through the surgical changes  some major some subtle  required to bring the book to life one such inspired choice is the translation of alia  pauls sister  from insidious toddler to a sentient psychic fetus the change is made specifically for the screen sidestepping the need for an awkward toddler actor while still preserving herberts trademark peculiarities however not every reconfiguration of text is a good one for a film so deft at upending white savior tropes and colonizer narratives dunes lone sore spot remains how eager it is to deislamize its fremen people going so far as to hiring game of thrones conlanger david j peterson to create a fictional language to replace herberts widespread use of arabic part twos expected  but no less disappointing  brand of hollywood cowardice aims to hobble its own themes  despite its missteps dune part two remains a bracing achievement in science fiction imagemaking and the coalescence of a singular vision that started over three years ago transforming herberts prose into a visual cauldron of weird mysticism resistance warfare and the tangle of resigned fates part two dares to be an ip blockbuster that is knotty and bleak as the final notes of pauls violent ascendency curdle from triumph to ominous portent it all becomes crystal clear denis villeneuve gets it bring on messiah
Mar 14 2024,negative, a warrior princess a terrifying teddy bear and giant sand worms heres the best and worst of the films the pop culture planet writers have watched this week in damsel millie bobby brown plays elodie who gets sworn into a life of royalty to help her people this is no fairytale as the prince shes marrying comes from an ancient kingdom that owes a centuries long debt in order for the kingdom to live on a sacrifice must be made brown is astounding as the sacrificial princess her performance keeps you engaged as she displays trepidation and determination to get out of her predicament brown does an excellent service to elodies character as an endearing and witty young woman that felt authentic on screen  though there are cgi flaws such as the glowing worms the film does a very great job with the dragon voiced by shohreh aghdashloo aghdashloo brings not only a haunting sense but also a depth in vulnerability to her role taking what couldve been a simple revenge story and adding a more sentimental aspect to her makes it enjoyable to unpack the bond elodie and the dragon create is an unexpected twist that adds to the tension towards the kingdom that lied to both of them compassion for the misunderstood is at the forefront of this film and makes for a compelling narrative  in dune part 2 paul atreides timothée chalamet unites with the fremen while seeking revenge against those who destroyed his family when hes faced with a terrible future only he can foresee he has a choice between love and the fate of the universe based on the scifi epic book series by frank herbert dune part two wasnt for me  and thats okay i found the film to be long and dragged out while the cultural and religious aspects felt whitewashed the film is starstudded with actors like christopher walken that felt more like glorified cameos that dont add much to the story there is also a blondelevel moment of cringe around lady jessica rebecca ferguson that comes off as ridiculous the highlights were the epic action with the sand worms and florence pughs gorgeous wardrobe as princess irulan its been a great time for original horror in theaters but blumhouse hasnt been getting it right from lackluster entries like the exorcist believer and night swim imaginary is another l on the list the film follows jessica dewanda wise who moves back into her childhood home with her family the behavior of her youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun becomes concerning when she finds a stuffed teddy bear named chauncey that is much more that he seems while imaginary has surprising twists and turns its ultimately cheesy and unserious it is full of weak performances and even worse dialogue including an awkward line from a therapist asking if alice has taken on new hobbies like ventriloquism to explain chaunceys voice chauncey is more silly than scary  although under the right direction he couldve come across as more campy to win over audiences my theater was laughing a lot but more from weak dialogue which i dont think was the intent the stand outs in the film were the positive relationship that builds between jessica and her stepdaughters breaking the mold from typical stereotypes and the unique practical set of the imaginary world of the never ever which gave off labyrinth energy  a young woman eager to earn some cash arrives in a new town and secures a night shift at a sketchy motel managed by teddy miles lamorne morris who is friendly but slightly on edge and eager to leave miles assures gwen phoebe tonkin that the place is harmless despite all evidence to the contrary when miles leaves gwen is sure she is being watched by someone from her past but as the night progresses she becomes convinced the motel is haunted night shift is a movie that offers a few jump scares but takes too long to pick up the plot falls very flat and while the actors are good the characters introduced along the way are underdeveloped and underutilized while i thought the choice of committing to one location was just right for the film it could have been stronger if the story had more moments of spontaneity the story was pretty lackluster and predictable though the major plot twist was intriguing it created a rushed ending that failed to add to the story kristen maldonado is an entertainment journalist critic and oncamera host she is the founder of the outlet pop culture planet and hosts its inclusionfocused video podcast of the same name you can find her bingewatching your next favorite tv show interviewing talent and championing representation in all forms she is a rotten tomatoesapproved critic a member of the critics choice association latino entertainment journalists association and the television academy and a 2x shorty award winner shes also been featured on new york live ny1 the list tv den of geek good morning america insider mtv and glamour
Mar 13 2024,positive, on every technical level this is a work of cinematic genius the craft is expertly made and it shows in every shot every note of the music and every scene that transports the audience to arrakis timothée chalamet continues his ascent from space prince to cult messiah and he digs deep for his mesmerizing and powerful performance as paul atreides everyone in this stacked cast commits all they can to the film and helps it transcend from an ordinary movie to a scifi epic if you loved the first movie youll love this one and if you were bored by the long space opera youll still be bored here its nearly three hours long so if you dont want to take the ride dont but if you do youre in for a treat
Mar 12 2024,positive,this was the best adaptation of a book that ive ever seen 
Mar 12 2024,positive, a desert landscape magical spices an occupying force a native warrior community and a handsome young hero bred to liberate themdune part two seems to have it all but does it while frank herberts original series was about the dangers of messianism denis villeneuves rendition wields ambivalence like a secret weapon in its effort to avoid the tough questions dune part two the latest installment of denis villaneuves adaptation of frank herberts enduring and supposedly unadaptable science fiction series carries a great weight on its shoulders it must succeed as a continuation of the first movie without losing new viewers and while bearing the box offices dreams for an industry that has flagged in comparison to last year it must give the thrill of a big science fiction blockbuster while seeming to undermine the transparent teenage fantasies that flourish throughout those stories a desert landscape spices with magical properties an occupying force a community of native warriors and a handsome young hero bred and trained to liberate them alldune part two has all the right elements of success including a starstudded cast timothée chalamet transforms from waif to despot zendaya guides the audiences perspective with her pensive eyes rebecca ferguson giving us reverend mother javier bardem is both affable mentor and zealot and austin butler sheds the elvis accent and all of his hair villeneuve streamlines the vast scope of herberts story into a series of sweeping set pieces more plentiful in this installment and meticulously executed the film charts paul atreidess swift rise while characterizing that rise as a cautionary tale too for just as paul needs to save his family and his adopted planet arrakis from the occupying harkonnens villeneuve must salvage knowing selfcritique from the jaws of teenage fantasy clichés when we first meet paul and his family in dune part one the atreides are part of the intergalactic aristocracy and are bequeathed arrakis by imperial decree arrakis is a stark unforgiving planet but its deserts and deadly worms also produce spice the most valuable substance in the galaxy the atreides hope to turn around the familys fortunes with the power of the spice production in arrakis they exchange the comforts and oceans of their home world for it yet little do they know they have walked into a trap set by a rival family with whom they have been feuding for centuries in dune part one we follow paul and the atreides as they are stripped of all their advantages paul and his mother jessica are left in the vast desert of arrakis seeking safe haven with a group of fremen the people indigenous to the planet now in dune part two we return to paul who hopes to gather his strength against house harkonnenthe villainous family that secured a planetary takeover with the emperors clandestine support pauls prospects are as limited as the water supply in arrakis and his only potential allies are the fremen who are understandably suspicious of outsiders but paul proves his worth as a warrior and earns their hospitality meanwhile stilgar a fremen leader takes paul and his mother into the fremens sietch the cave warren where they live out of view of harkonnen eyes there paul is greeted by rumblings among some fremen that he might be their messiah paul says he doesnt want to lead he just wants to fight alongside them the harkonnens have the guns and technology but at nearly every turn they are outmaneuvered by paul and the fremen the fremen are fierce fighters who have been hardened by desert life and they know how to resist the harkonnen occupation by interrupting spice extraction in every way possible led by the baron played by a grotesque stellan skarsgård the harkonnens are cartoonish villains and barring skarsgårds game performance their depiction feels like a shortcut in villaneuves imagination the harkonnens are bad guys who dress in black kill their underlings on a whim and assemble their armies in rigid formations reminiscent of leni riefenstahls nazi propaganda films its not just that they are a cliché its that caricatures are not that menacing the real threat to the galaxy then is not in a war between good guys and bad guys but in how belief can turn into violence and selfdefense into a despotic bid for power the fremens religion preaches the hope of a savior the lisan al gaib and as the film goes on paul seems to perfectly fit their prophecy paul knows too much to be fully taken in by the religious fervor but even his mother has a messianic prophecy that she works to bring about she is a sister of the bene gesserit a mystic cabal of political operators who advise those in power but who are also engineering the rise of their own messiah the kwisatz haderach for most of the film paul resists these projected messianic narrativesuntil he succumbs to the temptation to wield the faith of thousands as his last resort one of the reasons the dune novels have been difficult to adapt is that pauls story is at the center of a vast scale of conspiracies and machinations there are the imperial house corrinos ambitions and their manipulation of the atreides and harkonnen for their own gains and there is the spacing guild left out of villaneuves version altogether that controls all interplanetary travel and depends entirely on spice computers have been replaced by highly trained humans called mentats the bene gesserit have their own centurieslong eugenicist project of which paul is one of the most recent products and in the novel pauls story unfolds over a longer period of time he becomes immersed in the ways of the fremen he spends years waging guerilla campaigns against the harkonnen he has a son with chani villaneuve compacts the storyline for clarity keeping the most essential portions if losing some of its intricacies yet some important elements get lost in the cuts the awe we might feel of a man both empowered and reduced in the face of galaxysized projects is replaced by the awe of vast landscapes for a film invested in grand spectacle the desert embodies the ambivalence of a world where nothing is ever just one thing it is a source of wealth but also a place of death a hostile home a visual splendor and an impassive vastness villaneuve and cinematographer greg frasier capture the desert in its varieties but their palette also limits the world to shades of bleakness it can be striking to see a figure framed as an iconographic silhouette against a nearmonochromatic backdrop but too much of the same image weaken its profundity there are only so many ways to look at the undulating waves of the sand against a broad beige sky especially when the fremen sartorial style is just as beige camouflage makes sense of course but even when we see inside the fremen living quarters the only pops of color are their watchful blue eyes blue eyes are a symptom of spice intake for the fremen the spice is a part of life its in the food they eat and the air they breathe but for paul there are some serious side effects including prophetic visions out of his control in herberts novel the effects of these visions are a more central and dramatic concern they are fragmented and unclear but they show paul a religious war with an unfathomable cost and blood on his hands paul tries to find a way to avoid that future but the prophecies dont just elude his control they fracture his sense of self he struggles to keep his grasp on a reality that passes through his hands like a fistful of sand in villaneuves rendition these visions are more discrete and less fragmentary rather than disorient viewers the visions hardly compete with the excitement and set pieces that surround them we lose the sense of the mystical that percolates throughout herberts novels and the ability to see possible futures other than the one paul sees for the most part we are stuck within pauls perspective learning the world of dune as he does we like paul his heart is in a good place and we want to see him win we also know how this kind of story works our hero starts with nothing he resists his calling before inevitably gaining the power he deserves the films very form is structured around pauls ascendance and his harrowing visions are mere speed bumps on his path to victory as part two unfolds the film tries to distance us from our heros choices by foregrounding chanis point of view through chanis eyes we see the costs of pauls rise and how paul walks right into the choices in his visions it is chanis face her reactions her pleading that offer a moral conscience to a world that like its landscapes gets bleaker and bleaker she counsels him against the actions that lead to the end of the movie and make pauls nightmares a reality for everyone else while the original series was all about the corrosive power of adulation and the wayward paths on which messianism can lead us villeneuves dune part two is like so much film and television today it wields its ambivalence like a secret weapon it offers up set pieces and violent victories for viewers to revel in and draws paul toward an apocalyptic end that becomes increasingly unavoidable but the film doesnt complicate our feelings as much as it performs ambivalence for us the film warns us against the very thing it gives us we watch from reclining chairs as paul starts a holy warour hands are clean we get the heroic battles and the guilt on the side our hero is tortured so we dont have to be all we need to do is just sit

Mar 12 2024,positive, no one cries in the desert in a place where water is precious nothing can be wasted dune feels without tears dune speaks without words  director denis villeneuve may be the greatest filmmaker of his generation author frank herbert may be the greatest science fiction writer of all time by combining the two of them theyve created a fully realized universe of revenge and power in a way thats utterly unique its like nothing else youve seen or will see again for those who havent read the books much of frank herberts story takes place in the minds and inner thoughts of his characters because of that hollywood has shied away from turning this science fiction touchstone into a movie event for years the last time someone tried in the eighties the result was a disaster how do you film a movie where all your characters think and dont emote or speak you cant i cant maybe no one else in the world can except denis villeneuve  in the eyes of villeneuve dialogue is lazy a true visual storyteller can communicate without speaking and he does it he does it over and over and over again and translates what was once thought to be an unfilmable narrative into one of the greatest movie masterpieces ever created he does it by using images and sound and the nuanced faces of some of hollywoods most talented young actors mute the dialogue in dune part two and you wouldnt notice villeneuve tells a story beyond words by the time dune part two is over we know this world and these characters on a deeply intimate level we understand what drives them and we feel the lesson theyve learned that lesson is this when war is upon you fight 
Mar 11 2024,negative, the sand trembles and appears to harden like goose bumps on the forearms of impressionable scifi geeks we come to space operas to be transported and few sights are as entrancing as the moment a giant sandworm its circular mouth baring a fearsome set of sharp needleshaped chompers rises to the surface  dune part two director denis villeneuves return to the worlds created by author frank herbert delivers the imposing spectacle with visual splendor and a deafening sound mix we want to witness our brave and determined protagonists first surfing expedition atop the cylindrical critters the scene comes fairly early in this hefty continuation of the cinematic retelling of herberts dense highly influential 1965 novel dont you dare call it a sequel and it does not disappoint timothée chalamet as paul atreides and zendaya as chani in a scene from dune part two photo by niko tavernise  2023 warner bros entertainment inc what does come as a letdown is how this knotty exploration of lust for power faithbased fervor and that snakecharmers dance between fate and chance proceeds to get lost in the desert villeneuve who struck such an adroit balance between storytelling and worldbuilding in 2021s squarejawed but satisfying dune part one is so intent in lending biblical weight to this star war that he drains the film of much of its pulp and what starts out as engaging genre yarn turns into a bloated endurance test hes made an otherworldly voyage that forgets to be a popcorn movie getting through all 166 minutes of it feels like homework part two picks up minutes after part one left off with paul atreides timothée chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson heading off into the sands of arrakis the desert planet they initially landed on to oversee alongside pauls dad duke leto atreides oscar isaac sorely missed before the very ruler who appointed them there conspired to wipe out the atreides kingdom or as herbert coined it house atreides mother and son survived the extermination that claimed letos life and have joined the fremen arrakis native residents and their chieftain stilgar javier bardem in the anthony quinn role with whom leto wanted to establish an alliance before it all went belly up the problem that paul and jessica face is that the fremen are split between those who remain wary of outsiders and want to banish the new arrivals into the desert and those who revere the pair and regard paul as a messianic figure and the fulfillment of a prophecy stilgar a fierce believer in that prophecy is on paul and jessicas corner but they will have to prove their usefulness more skeptical but curious about paul is chani zendaya who proves to be a valuable ally to the young aristocrat in turn paul insists he has no appetite for power and just wants to help the fremen meanwhile emperor shaddam iv christopher walken is weighing the consequences of his betrayal aimed at eliminating house atreides while his daughter princess irulan corrino florence pugh learns that paul may be alive they do not appear to stop their coconspirator the dastardly and freakishly blubbery baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård and his nephew count glossu rabban dave bautista from searching for paul but scenes set outside arrakis are few and far between in dune part two by contrast a considerable portion of part one took place in the atreides home planet of caladan giving viewers a welcome change of scenery but for the majority of its runtime this latest chapter leaves us stuck in that big dust bowl where jessica uses her ties to the powerful and mysterious bene gesserit order to help sway public opinion about her son but the aesthetic sameness that engulfs the character makes her quest feel oppressive and that extends to the way villeneuve working from a screenplay credited to him and jon spaihts depicts religious devotion in stark monochromatic terms there are skeptics believers and the torn brooding paul stuck in the middle haunted by disturbing visions noticeably missing are the shades of gray that would make his predicament more intriguing austin butler as feydrautha harkonnen and léa seydoux as lady margot fenring in a scene from dune part two photo by niko tavernise  2024 warner bros entertainment inc as for his friendship with chani it evolves into something more at least on paper villeneuve may possess multiple strengths as a filmmaker but conveying romance is not one of them chalamet and zendaya fight a gallant but losing battle to make us believe their characters are an item which may not seem like a big issue but it becomes one when the movie hinges its dramatic payoff on their bond more effective is the emergence of feydrautha baron harkonnens psychotic bloodthirsty younger nephew austin butler commands the role played by sting in david lynchs 1984 dune adaptation before he joins the efforts to root out paul feyd crosses paths with the enigmatic lady margot fenring léa seydoux looking as if she stepped out of a perfume ad who has her own motives for approaching the bald obsidianeyed sociopath butler and seydoux share limited screen time together but they set off considerably more sparks than chalamet and zendaya by the time villeneuve and spaihts tie their narrative strands together this ostensible middle chapter has become too much of a chore pugh dressed like shes heading to a renaissance fair gives a rare stiff performance she and the formidable walken are given nothing to do beyond greek chorus duties butler dives into the villainous feydrautha with rockstar abandon but theres not enough of him to turn things around and the films strained attempts to portray the change in pauls worldview feel imposed and mechanical rather than earned it reduces the conflicted wouldbe leader to a barking politician with a god complex the more confident the character appears the less interesting he becomes dune part two desperately wants you to take it seriously which is kind of hard when it features spaceships that look like testicles and is awash in phallic imagery villeneuve pummels you with portent diluting the movies entertainment value in the process he gets to indulge in his most heavyhanded instincts behind the camera to the extent that whats in front of it resembles a fireandbrimstone sermon hes preaching the gospel of paul but neglected to accommodate the nonbelievers he won over the first time around the spice doesnt flow here the bloom is off this desert rose it did leave me with a gift but not one i wanted a big pounding headache my temples throbbed but my imagination stayed firmly planted on the shifting sands timothée chalamet as paul atreides and austin butler as feydrautha

Mar 11 2024,positive,epic visually but the story is still hard to follow if you have not read the book
Mar 11 2024,positive, a combination of a journalism assignment at the oregon dunes and the recreational usage of psilocybin mushrooms led frank herbert to write dune a sprawling five book saga beloved by many they featured intergalactic warfare giant wormrelated destruction and trenchant criticism of politics and religion on the one hand youd expect that as a lifelong genre dweeb and scifi nerd i would have been into these books on the other hand those are some seriously longass books i put off reading them and if you know anything about me i have some god tier procrastination skills years passed i did not give the spicefilled planet of arrakis a second thought then in conversation with my friend kristin that changed you see shes both an english major and a fellow geek kindly but firmly she insisted i read just the first of herberts books its good trust me she said or words to that effect as it turns out kristin was right i didnt fall in love with the novel but there was some weaponsgrade strangeness at play amidst the political maneuverings and talk of jihad its a classic and i understand why that is the book led me to denis villeneuves 2021 film adaptation dune that led me to dune part two villeneuves hotly anticipated sequel does it live up to the hype you bet your fedaykin ass it does we pick up where dune left off and in a power move rivaling the mcu theres zero attempt to bring new viewers up to speed so at the risk of sounding like a stroke victim lets dive in princess irulan florence pugh the daughter of emperor shaddam iv christopher walken dictates in her journal that paul atreides timothee chalamet may yet survive  thats surprising since the atreides clan has largely been slaughtered by house harkonnen you see the harkonnen clan is led by the sluglike baron vladimir stellan skarsgard and his for the moment right hand rabban dave bautista they are not to put too fine a point on it not nice people and the harkonnens are now concerning themselves with bringing the desert planet arrakis to heel and controlling the flow of spice the good news for paul is that hes actually alive hes hanging out with the fremen what the arrakis locals call themselves half of the fremen think that paul and his space witch mother jessica rebecca ferguson are more trouble than theyre worth that includes chani zendaya a warrior whos fifty percent sweet on paul and fifty percent sure hell bring the fremen to ruin thats because stilgar javier bardem the leader of this tribe of fremen is positive that paul is an honesttogod messiah maybe he is paul has dreams he sees signs and portents possible futures disasters and a narrow path to something he thinks of as victory can he achieve victory over feydrautha austin butler a harkonnen psychopath and knife enthusiast again it depends on how you define the concept of victory first lets clear something up these days theres a nasty habit amongst filmgoers that a movie is either an offensive assault or the greatest work of cinematic art ever the fact is most movies fall somewhere within the pretty good classification you watch them you have a nice time then you live your life  bearing that in mind dune part two is genuinely an epic in every sense of the word one on the same tier as the empire strikes back and peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy lots of studio films feel as if theyve been designed by committee and focusgrouped to within an inch of their lives not here the sweep of the arid vistas blood and thunder and armies clashing are fully within service of denis villeneuves vision the canvas he paints on is enormous it spans between planets and takes us from the back of a massive sandworm to the cozy confines of a tent all the technical aspects from the effects work to the costuming and set design work in harmony to deliver specific people during a specific time part two has a two hour fortysix minute run time add that to the first film and youve got essentially a five hour adaptation of the first book i think thats necessary since villeneuve needs to set up the world the players and their motivations he does so efficiently and there were only a few moments where i was aware of the passage of time is the script by villeneuve and jon spaihts as sparkling as the direction not quite everyone in house harkonnen is essentially team evil and their character motivations range from i love conquering people to i love stabbing people the nuance is saved for our protagonists without getting too deep into spoiler territory paul walks a path thats the polar opposite of the heros journey the script does excellent work showing his hesitation his struggle and the decisions he makes it also focuses on how others react to his potential chosen oneness we see jessica spreading tales about pauls godhood and slowly coming to believe it herself along with that are interesting questions raised about politics fanaticism and cultural appropriation instead of becoming annoyingly preachy the characters wrestle with these complex issues and that makes them fascinating this is a prestige picture by warner brothers since no effort has been spared the cast here is doubleplus stacked everyone does strong work but i have a life to live so im not going to go into the eighteen dozen massive stars that appear in this film instead lets focus on three of them as stilgar javier bardem plays a leader happy to cede his authority to paul hell be the rock upon which paul builds his church and he conducts himself with the serenity of a believer  or a fanatic his opposite is chani zendaya plays her as sensible hard headed exactly the wrong person to get involved in a burgeoning holy war their focus is timothee chalamets paul who has the charisma to be a leader of a movement and the intelligence to not screw it all up we see him shift from a callow noble to a determined resistance fighter to a religious figure and chalamet allows us to see pauls struggle every step of the way i wouldnt count myself as a dune superfan i cant recite the lore of the bene gesserit tell you the average length of a sandworm or explain why everyone in house harkonnen is hairless but as i said before i get it now dune part two is a singular vision painted on an enormous cinematic canvas see it on the biggest screen you can
Mar 11 2024,positive, building on his excellent cinematic grammar of prophecy denis villeneuve uses dune part two 2024 cowritten with jon spaihts to examine the experience of being set before the prophecy knowing youre its intended subject not to take the whole messiah thing literally but this narrative structure is famously hinted at in the gospels jesus good student that he was knew the biblical prophets were most likely referring to someone of his genealogy and position jesus the son of god was perfectly willing to fulfill the prophecy but jesus the son of mary and joseph ineluctably didnt want to die we see this in two brief episodes near his death in the garden of gethsemane he prays to god to shift the burden to someone else and on the cross just before the moment of his death he cries out to god joblike asking why he has forsaken him for obvious reasons we dont know much about that side of jesus paul atreides timothée chalamet good student that he is knows the bene gesserit kwisatz haderach most likely refers to someone of his genealogy and position jessica the bene gesserit sister is perfectly willing even a tad overeager to fulfill the prophecy but jessica the mother of paul ineluctably doesnt want him to die which he will if he fails to fulfill any single prophetic prediction we saw this in dune part one 2021 with the gom jabbar and we see it here when he drinks the water of life and when he fights feydrautha austin butler but unlike for jesus we know exactly whats going on in pauls head just like jesus paul has some supernatural abilities the voice by training sound designed by richard king and david whitehead clairvoyance by birth and spice but he also knows that the prophecy was created not by god but by bene gesserit manipulation and that following it will lead to untold sufferingthe suffering of others he stands at a crossroads at one point chani zendaya says decisions have been made for you but paul can still choose differently as many have noted by simply foregoing revenge the scene where he asks jamis babs olusanmokun what to do and all three answers are to take the plunge is thus unintentionally hilarious in how overdetermined it is its also honest evil actualizes when he goes with the flow and its momentum is unstoppable
Mar 10 2024,positive,the genius of the author herbert and now the director villeneuve is to weave all this complexity into an easily understood and compelling story its been tried before but this is the first time it has really worked
Mar 9 2024,positive, sure were eight thousand years in the future on planets far far away earth seems to have been all but forgotten but our protagonist paul atreides is a young man with white skin scion of a feudalistic colonialistic lord played by a white american actor of european extraction the character is from a world that is distinctly scottishflavored he inspires the fremen  the oppressed indigenous brownskinned muslimesque peoples of the desert cough middle eastern cough planet arakis and as depicted here more a collective mass than individual people  to rise up against their oppressors the harkonnens who are other literally whiteskinned feudalistic colonials arakis is home to the spice that is required for interstellar navigation the spice is this civilizations oil and unlike in our 20th21stcentury reality the people sitting on the incredibly valuable incredibly essential natural resource are not the ones who benefit from it dune is lawrence of arabia if good ol te headed out there after wwii when car culture started booming instead of during wwi  whether the prophecy that helps install paul in his whitesavior role is real or not is beside the point white western men whether herbert and villeneuve think its plausible that indigenous people would accept an outsider  who just happens to look more like a white western man than he does like those indigenous people  as their salvation even if you want to take dune as a critique of the idea of the white savior  and again theres no hint of that in this movie  we can still question that critique being structured as it is  a far more potent critique of the whitesavior narrative might center the fremen perhaps put someone like zendayas fremen warrior chani in the protagonist role  why cant she have a heros journey rather than paul but thats not the book that herbert wrote and if villeneuve wants to adhere closely to the novel paulassavior is the story we are stuck with dune is one of the biggest selling novels of all time  not just in the sciencefiction genre but of any stripe  with a devoted fanbase that would surely be cheesed off by too much divergence from the text sigh perhaps there will come a day when fanboys dont rule but it is not this day so now we have the back half of villeneuves blade runner 2049 arrival adaptation of the first dune novel does it offer any critique of the whitesavior trope i dont see it paul is unquestionably a white savior most of the fremen accept him as their savior and while there is critique of cultural appropriation more on that in a bit its also arguably a problem that the primary fremen characters here  chani and javier bardems stilgar  are not played by actors of mena middle eastern and north african background its not that zendaya spiderman homecoming and bardem everybody knows mother arent terrific of course they are and they look more the part than could have been the case there are white westerners in these roles in david lynchs 1984 adaptation of the book for instance but its a problem that a movie that purports to critique colonialism kinda looks like a good example of colonialism even in the woke 2020s that said paul is appropriately not a good guy in the eyes of anyone except maybe the fremen this is in keeping with the books there are no genuine good guys here maybe chani could be considered such she is at least cleareyed about what is going on with paul and the fremen dune part two is a warning about demagoguery about the use of religion as a tool to control the masses this warning as villeneuve deploys it is blatant ridiculously overthetop but given the times we are living in with populist fascism and fundamentalist religious bullshit springing up everywhere and no im not talking about anything muslim overthetop feels like it might be necessary to get some thickheaded numbskulls to see it dune 2 is a genuinely terrifying movie though it sneaks up on you even if you are an openminded politically aware soul already attuned to the horrific shit going down in our real 2020s world partly its terrifying because obviously so many people  including the artists making blockbuster movies  can see whats happening to us all and yet we seem to be collectively incapable of stopping it young paul atreides timothée chalamet dont look up little women having survived the massacre of his house by house harkonnen in the first movie is now living among the fremen in remote wastes of arakis trying to prove to them that he is more than a spoiled princeling and genuinely wants to promote their independence from galactic occupiers why does he want this is it just revenge justice for his father duke leto these questions are part of the thorniness that is paul atreides this means he has to contend with a prophecy that suggests that he may be the liberator long foretold who will release the fremen from the shackles of those stealing the sweet spice from under their literal feet some of the fremen such as the older stilgar have fallen under pauls inadvertent spell others including chani and her young friends not so much villeneuve who adapted herberts book with screenwriter jon spaihts passengers doctor strange gives us a lot of truly lovely stuff as he depicts life among the fremen i found it beautiful how sand walking the arhythmic movement that the fremen use to avoid drawing the attention of the giant subterranean sandworms looks like dancing and how the patterns sand walking leaves in the sand looks like arabic script fremen culture is much more elaborately depicted here than it was in the first film which makes it much more frustrating that no middle eastern actors were cast in significant fremen roles the talent is there cmon we appreciate the immense tragedy when the fremen culture is attacked again in a renewed harkonnen offensive to retake what they see as theirs the political machinations are many here and i dont want to spoil them for those who havent read the book which will be most of the movies viewers because book bestsellership requires far smaller an audience than movie blockbustership the fantastic cast also features christopher walken the jungle book eddie the eagle as the feckless emperor and léa seydoux no time to die the grand budapest hotel as another bene gesserit wielding powers simultaneously awesome and pathetically prosaic josh brolin avengers endgame deadpool 2 returns as atreides soldier gurney halleck but this is very much a story about power as control and about the politics that enable that control as religion that fremen prophecy foretelling the arrival of a liberator total fabrication of the bene gesserit religious order from which women pull the galactic strings theyve been working on this for centuries but even they with their mystical powers and wellearned aura of menace do not have the control they think they do dune 2 is ugly and outrageous and brutal and cynical and it hits square in the social plexus of the horrifying realworld 2024 milieu in which we all exist which slightly softens all the whitesavior culturalappropriation stuff this movie while not perfect has important shit to say shit that must be heard again villeneuves hand with it all is an elegant sledgehammer bashing us around the head about things we should already be able to see for ourselves but clearly cant or wont its like this as the cruel sluglike baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård borg vs mcenroe our kind of traitor vies to regain his control of arakis he removes his arakis lieutenantship from one nephew beast rabban dave bautista knock at the cabin my spy and hands it to another feydrautha austin butler aliens in the attic when she hears of this the emperors daughter princess irulan florence pugh oppenheimer black widow is appalled but hes psychotic she objects and the first thing that sprang to mind for me was but arent they all villeneuves depiction of the harkonnen homeworld giedi prime will make your blood run cold we meet feydrautha as his uncle grants him a gladiatorial battle in a brutalist stadium to prove his mettle before the populace  its fixed of course the other combatants are drugged  and its some real leni riefenstahl shit bad enough but giedi prime basks in the sickening glow of a black sun and cinematographer greig fraser shoots this not in a creamy dreamy blackandwhite but in a kind of infrared which leaches color and is simply stomachchurningly wrong the kind of wrong that screams human beings should not be living in this kind of natural environment and no wonder the harkonnens are such awful people oh and black sun is definitely a nazi thing but it isnt only the harkonnens who are psychotic paul and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson reminiscence doctor sleep by now arent much better a bene gesserit priestess she accepts the role of reverend mother among the fremen and she leans hard into the job tattooing her face with fremen symbols that represent the prophecy is the least of it its more whitesavior crap  why would the fremen want an outsider as their spiritual leader she doesnt even understand their culture has to be taught about it  but villeneuve also leans hard into showing how deeply wrong what jessica is doing is in the first film she seemed a sympathetic character defying the bene gesserit leadership in the form of the calculating reverend mother mohiam charlotte rampling the little stranger red sparrow and throwing a spanner into their plan to manipulate the powerful men who rule the galaxy its complicated but as part of the bene gesserit long game she was supposed to have a daughter by leto not the son that paul is the sex of her child was under her control bene gesserit workarounds for that come into play here now though it seems that it wasnt galactic fascism she objected to merely the particular flavor of it that would have excluded paul with a path in sight to grab power for her son shes suddenly all for it are we the audience suddenly all for it as well dune 2 is a long movie and it revels in that its seductive it sucks you in gets you on pauls side as in the sequence when he calls a sandworm to ride for the first time to demonstrate his worthiness as a member of fremen society it is big bold grand mythmaking stuff the film prompts us to cheer his success and its tough not to but i would like to think  and its not that much of a stretch really  that villeneuve is very desperately asking his audience to recognize the cognitive dissonance that many of us will come into this film with and possibly leave with can we see that this young man whom we reflexively applaud is actually you know a tyrant in the making and what do we do with that realization if we do come to it because one of the last images of dune part two is paul rallying the fremen for even bigger bloodier battles to come whether a presumed third film materializes or not and while the visual details of it are quite different from the naziesque rally on the harkonnen homeworld  the colors are deceptively warm for one  it is at its root exactly the same vile horror about the power of personality and propaganda to move masses villeneuve is fucking with us in a way that im not sure mainstream audiences are ready to deal with because real leaders in the real world are pulling the same shit the stakes are so very high are we up to the challenge you are wrong  dune is not a savior narrative of any kind paul does not in fact save anyone from anything  the reason you cant see this is the same as the fanboys who only know how to say woke as they have so embraced their own limitations and refuse to grow out of them  you have such a strong and limited that to quote paul you see only what you want to see he literally walks into a culture about which all he knows is what hes read in a book and is acclaimed as their savior and so far so good its not going to go well but no one knows that yet he is acclaimed as a savior by the fremen because catholics have proselytized for centuries to get poor people to wait for a savior to come  sound familiar in the process of turning dessert world dune into a paradise  he destroys the dessert and the worms damaging the ecology again sound familiar dune is not a savior narrative  it is a story of the jihad vs the crusades but set in space and it is a bitter critique of the hypocrisy of religion and the folly of messiahs and heroes i am reviewing this movie i am not reviewing the books and i am not reviewing whatever movie might come next if any at all however long it takes for these movies to get to making the points you are talking about it isnt there yet and this movie exists in a history of hollywood that has centered white people and particularly white men for far too long that is also a context in which it must be understood in the novels paul becomes more and more a god emperor or dune messiah and after the first sequels herbert realizes that each new one gushes money and they become wispier and wispier as he pumps them out most of the people commenting on maryanns review were talking about the book instead of the movie although you were presumably joking when you did it having read all the dune books that frank herbert wrote and none of the ones that his son and kevin j anderson produced after his death i have a hard time picturing frank pumping out sequel after sequel because they gush money  if i remember correctly the atreides are supposedly of greek ancestry so mediterranean in origin of course whether this is still relevant after more than 10000 years is another question herbert famously said that dune was intended as a warning against messianic figures so whether this defies your interpretation of dune as a whitesavior trope is something that i leave up to you  it is denis villeneuve and his production team that picked the actor for paul so if anyone is to blame for the white savior it is them i think frank herbert was just thinking in terms of led by the outsider as a trope which is more generic that the whitesavior trope and while the fremen can be seen as standins for middleeastern people i dont think that was frank herberts intention necessarily by placing the story so far into the future he wanted the fremen to be a people of nondescript ethnicity a people uniquely shaped by arrakis i personally think that paul is the villain of the story and not the hero nor the white savior after he drinks the water of life and achieves the ability to see future and past clearly with the direction of the future being defined by the choices he has and will make he consciously make the choice to pick the path to the future that leads to his and his mothers and unborn sisters survival even if that means unleashing a religious war on the universe in which millions or even billions will die and those people will both be on the fremen and nonfremen sides btw jessica in the ceremony where she drinks the water of life is gifted with the memory of the previous reverend mother that was part of the fremen who in turn acquired the memory of her predecessor this way jessica is immediately fully versed in the fremen culture herbert famously said that dune was intended as a warning against messianic figures so whether this defies your interpretation of dune as a whitesavior trope is something that i leave up to you authorial intent is just one part of the puzzle and frankly the least important one things can be present in stories that authors didnt intend and things they intended can be missing but again i am reviewing this movie not the book no and a quick google search doesnt make me any wiser apart from listing a number of ma and pa kettle go to  movies from the 1950s nothing about arrakis though
Mar 9 2024,positive, i see possible futures all at once and in so many futures our enemies prevail comments paul atreides timothée chalamet while sounding like the kwisatz haderach his bene gesserit mother confidant and best friend lady jessica rebecca ferguson pregnant with pauls psychic sister waits for her son to fulfill his destiny while the sandwormriding fremen led by stilgar javier bardem see the young man as their mahdi or savior like george lucas and ridley scott filmmaker denis villeneuve proves himself a visionary as dune part two is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time when teenage villeneuve read frank herberts dune for the first time 43 years ago he was unaware of the implications of that moment only someone with such profound adoration for the 1965 novel could have delivered such an ambitious masterful and speculative adaptation of the scifi classic as dune part two villeneuve and cowriter jon spaihts forge their path as the duo loosen up for the second part of the saga they bring a fresh perspective to the material by breaking away from the novel a few times especially with the character of chani played by zendaya it translates better for the screen while allowing the actress to shine by playing a multifaceted character with alternating emotions shes torn between her love for paul and what she feels is blind faith exhibited by her people they believe paul renamed mauddib after the smart arrakis desert mouse is their messiah chani not so much zendaya is firstrate as the conflicted warrior who yells this prophecy is how they enslave us while sending shivers to the audience dune part two picks up where the first film left off it moves at a faster pace there is more action greater special effects and a fresh group of actors joining the cast including florence pugh christopher walken léa seydoux anya taylorjoy souheila yacoub and the sagas biggest surprise and best addition austin butler as the villainous feydrautha gone is butlers elvis accent it took him a while to shake it as the actor is transformed into the ambitious warrior nephew of baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård sting played the role in the 1984 version directed by david lynch here butler is truly frightening he moves like a tiger waiting for the right moment to pounce the shaven head and pale complexion in contrast to the dark clothing give the actor the appearance of a cenobite forged from the mind of clive barker the monochrome gladiator scene in the film stands out as villeneuve removes the beauty of color and all visual distractions to focus on butlers firstrate performance timothée chalamets portrayal as the films hero is better highlighted as the actor gets to take a deep dive into paul who is torn in several directions before finally accepting his fate the biblical overtones are omnipresent i also enjoyed the performance by rebecca ferguson as lady jessica her tattooed face incandescent eyes and look of determination let the swedish actress deliver a subtle performance that doesnt require much dialogue to attain distinction 2021s dune covered roughly 23 of herberts novel setting up events for the climactic part two which shifts the balance in characters dave bautistas glossu rabban and charlotte ramplings reverend mother mohiam are scaled back while josh brolins gurney halleck comes in at the right moment to step up his role as the former house atreides military leader proves to be pauls biggest supporter and friend the vip in the ensemble goes to javier bardem as fremen sietch tab leader stilgar the oscarwinning actor brings humor and bravado to the role its a commanding performance on par with no country for old men biutiful and being the ricardos the special effects are as expected exhilarating and hans zimmers score which goes from haunting and ominous to a climaxbuilding crescendo is majestic evoking a sense of awe especially when accompanied by loire cotlers soulstirring vocals with arrival blade runner 2049 and now dune denis villeneuves impact on science fiction is immeasurable there are shades of his masterpiece sicario throughout dune part two from the way his camera follows the actors to the overhead shots and his use of the score to raise tension mailing address 2003 8th ave 300 fort worth tx 76110phone 8174059318email hellofortworthreportorgour missionwe pledge to produce highquality objective local journalism that informs public decisionmaking addresses the quality of life of our communitys citizens holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood in all that we do earning the trust and respect of our audience is paramount our reporting will be free to all who access our primary digital channels
Mar 9 2024,positive,where it really comes into its own as a hugely satisfying hollywood scifi epic is in the actionadventure material which is also backloaded so the very long film seems to keep getting bigger and richer as it goes along
Mar 9 2024,positive, faith and power clash at the core of dune part two the film is the second of a trilogy adaptation of the beloved novels by frank herbert a mystical tale of wars between noble families in the vastness of space and the rise of a messianic figure named paul atreides timothée chalamet  this middle film picks up the story after a brutal massacre of pauls family line heir of a noble house and the subject of prophecies paul wrestles with his apparent destiny as savior and leader his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson a clairvoyant priestess of the matriarchal religious order bene gesserit tries to maneuver him toward that destiny but his love chani zendaya wants only a simple life together amid this relational drama paul leads a desert tribe in guerrilla warfare against brutal imperial forces who want to hoard his planets precious element called spice dune part two is a lush adaptation of dense source material its a busy 2 hours and 46 minutes packed with plot and subplots and the constant threat of ravenous maneating sandworms the space battles are an impressive mix of tension and spectacle and the desert sand is almost its own character functioning as both shield and weapon for the warriors paul leads though combatants are armed with spacecraft and atomic weapons many fights come down to handtohand combat with swords choreographed to be quick powerful and exciting these elements make for a fun and engaging adaptation with solid performances and beautiful cinematography but dune part two owes its intellectual interest to herberts books is faith merely another resource to be exploited in the quest for power is it another drug like spice that the powerful can claim use and abuse or is it real tapping into a true well of knowledge and sustenance the dune series asks but doesnt try to answer a product of the early 1960s herberts work is deeply interested in the effects of psychedelic drugs spice is mildly psychedelic opening minds to see visions and nightmares another substance called the water of life is deeply psychedelic frequently fatal and lifealtering in its effects the dune stories treat these drugs as both beneficial and dangerous a gift for those few strong enough to absorb and survive the visions they induce that perspective feels like the product of a bygone era strange to consider after six decades of change in our norms and laws around drug use the book series take on drugs might have been provocative in 1965 but it feels dated and shallow in light of present conversations and concerns around drugs taking another cue from herberts books the movies universe is vaguely islamic the sand the clothing and even the language give it a lawrenceofarabiainspace feel this is a western interpretation of course not one originating from the muslim world itself and some elements like the bene gesserit are drawn more from catholicism than anything in islam that kind of storytelling syncretism can be risky but by taking elements of known faiths and throwing them into another world dune part two raises sharp questions about religion and power just as in our world there are many factions vying for controleven the factions have factions some are true believers convinced that paul atreides is a messianic figure who will lead his people to paradise others like chani believe in nothing but their own strength and swords and while the believers are mocked for their ability to contort any event to become a fulfillment of prophecy no one can deny the strength of their faith or the strength it gives them like the psychedelic spice faith is powerful and difficult to control the faithful become a force in themselves thats not to say faith always coincides with purity of heart the bene gesserit priestesses including pauls mother both shape and exploit the faith of the masses this second dune film leaves open to interpretation whether the priestesses themselves believe what they teach or simply use it to gain power they are both benevolent and sinister unpredictable and ineffable in some ways they echo pagan gods in their selfishness and inscrutability their ends are their own and the mere humans who cross them are easily sacrificed paul is different he cares for the people he eschews powerat least at first indeed he fears his own power and its place in a faith he isnt sure he shares dreading his fundamentalist followers and the horrors they may embrace because of their belief in him he can see the future perhaps multiple possible futures and his visions involve a devastating holy war waged in his name this is repugnant to himyet he is drawn inexorably into the fray the parallels to jesus are obvious and fascinating paul atreides begins his journey seeming a lot like christ he is foretold anticipated believed in even before he is born he cares for justice and peace he is humble loving given to service like jesus on the road to calvary paul longs to avoid the dark future ahead of him  but their paths diverge paul travels toward more earthly power more control more bloodshed jesus of course rejected that path though his followers expected and encouraged it acts 16 he chose the cross paul atreides does not in some ways dune feels like an exploration of what might have been had jesus told peter to sharpen his sword instead of to sheathe it matt 265253 the lessons of christianity are upside down in this universe to gain your life you do not lay it downyou take anothers life the last do not become first the least do not become greatest in the end the least are sacrificed the meek inherit nothing and yet here too to gain the world paul atreides must lose his soul
Mar 9 2024,positive, these are uncertain times for big ambitious science fiction films but with the release of french canadian auteur denis villeneuves enveloping dune part two the sandworm has turned in bringing his thematically rich visually stunning formally bifurcated adaptation of frank herberts 1965 space opera to a finale villeneuve has solved a riddle thats beguiled bigbrain filmmakers from alejandro jodorowsky to ridley scott to david lynch all of whom struggled to adapt herberts doorstop of a novel unlike the former two lynch actually did make his dune but that 1984 flop is a camp curiosity and lynch has disowned it as have many devotees of herberts book and its five sequels villeneuve reportedly wants to a make a third entry adapting herberts followup dune messiah but just the fact he got to finish this one feels miraculous given that its precursor part one was one of the very pricey movies that warner bros sent sent straight to the streaming service formerly known as hbo max in 2021 concurrent with its theatrical release in the us urgent and compelling even to those who havent read or only vaguely recall herberts dense farfuture saga part two runs a fleet 168 minutes bringing the two halves combined run time to five hours 23 minutesnone of them wasted this latter part wont prompt a reappraisal from anyone who complained that part one was meandering or humorless but this movie isnt for them it is largely humorless save for a few sly line readings from javier bardem and all the more absorbing for it bardem returns as a leader of the desertdwelling fremen of planet arrakis who are hunted by the brutal colonizing glabrous and chalkcomplected harkonnen clan the somber tone is actually a strength of the filmvilleneuve isnt throwing in quips to try to make all this fantasy glib or palatable to civilians in the tiresome way so many superhero films of recent vintage have tried to do even christopher walken in a handful of scenes as twofaced puppetmaster emperor shaddam iv plays it straight a world in which game of thrones becomes a spinoffspawning hit is a world ready for a straightarrow dune which is basically game of thrones meets the godfather anyway though the book predates both  anyway that bardem character stilgar believes the prophecies claiming that timothée chalamets byronesque paul atreides who with his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson is among the last survivors of a clan sent to harvest arrakis precious lifeextending consciousnessexpanding substance spice will become a savior to the fremen younger generations of these desert dwellerschief among them zendayas chani whose romance with paul adds melodramatic sweep to the movies abundant scopedismiss these religious convictions as propaganda as does paul himself hes also haunted by visions seeming to suggest hell become a despota troubling thing to learn about oneself much of this ancient dogma we learn has been seeded over generations by the bene gesserit a secretive sisterhood devoted to the enlightenment of the human species but they play the long long game making their motives opaque if not sinister as a reminder pauls own mom belongs to this intergalactic coven of maybegood witches i dont know why im indulging in the mortal critical sin of ladling on a plot summary here perhaps its to convince myself i actually understood a film i very much enjoyed i think i got maybe 77 percent of it villeneuve who cowrote the screenplay with jon spaihts is so adept at filling the frame with tension and mystery and at slicing away the exposition lynch left in that you can just let the experience wash over you cinematographer greig fraser shot the movie in imax and it warrants the maximalist format  like his fellow canadian visionary james cameron villeneuve upped his profile by making a superb sequel to a seminal paradigmshifting ridley scott classicaliens in camerons case blade runner 2049 in villeneuves but where cameron has chosen to spend his remaining creative years on planet pandora manufacturing worlds out of whole digital cloth villeneuve is still shooting his movies in real places arrakis is played mostly by jordan and abu dhabi and that tactile miseenscene yields visceral dividends you might actually feel the sand between your toes lady jessica and paul both spend parts of part two in conversation with the unborn child growing inside of jessicaa being villeneuve actually shows floating in the womb like the star child at the end of 2001 a space odyssey this world is beyond cruelty her big brother tells her why wait until shes actually born to let her in on what a sandy bummer it all is taken in tandem villeneuves grand enveloping dune splits the difference between stanley kubricks chilly exploration of human evolution and the pulpy star wars flicks that george lucas fashioned out of herberts novels akira kurosawa movies and 60s marvel comics butler playing the sociopathic young nephew of corpulent harkonnen in chief stellan skarsgård exhibits a heretofore unseen range affecting an uncanny impression of the swedish actors voice for a guy who got famous playing the king he makes a pretty good

Mar 9 2024,positive, fanaticism is a closed circle maddening because its impregnable maddening because it destroys everything in the process of building itself its a riddle without a solution and once youve drunk deep the plasma spring its a long way backif you ever get there there are people who deprogram cult members but i dont buy it you guys im of the belief that when youre gone youre gone you went by choice after all you denied your ears the beeswax but didnt tie yourself to the mast my mom bought into a cult for the last several years of her life she held on to it tightly and it gripped her right back i suppose thats one of the appealing things about cults when you find the right one you join the company of a great many people who agree with you if youre broken in some way if your awareness of that has made you lonesome and alone that must feel good i take a little bit of the blame for her susceptibility to such things i was a terrible son to her maybe she needed something to hold that would hold her back i did too i found it in a wonderful wife and kids she found it some of it in a cult that finally accepted her i dont know if i believe that i dont know what i believe maybe this is just narcissismmine or hers i dont know either but shes dead now and im the only one left to wonder about what happened between us throughout the entire extended running time of denis villeneuves dune part two messianic rebel and lawrence of arabia orientalist leader paul atriedes timothée chalamet refuses to court the support of millions of southern fundamentalist fighters because he knows that once he does he will become the colonialist monster his mother jessica rebecca ferguson has hoped he will be shes part of a cult you see the bene gesserit which has spread a story about the coming of a white god to the brown lands and brown people that has taken hold in the brutal southern hemisphere of a planet arrakis treasured and vied over for its natural resources the allegory proximate and ultimate isnt subtle paul falls in love with an indigenous fighter chani zendaya learns the language and the ways and is given a name by his chief advocate stilgar javier bardem both secret usul meaning the foundation of a column in the films madeup language and known muaddib after a small desert mouse that is resourceful enough to survive the harshest elements no matter what paul does to try to convince stilgar he is a man and not the quetzalcoatl to stilgars montezuma its more evidence in stilgars mind that paul is in fact the fulfillment of an implanted colonial prophecy designed to control his people and the resourcea psychotropic spice called melange that allows for instant spacetravel in this universeunique to his planet thats the nature of fanaticism cults religions whatever evidence you provide to disprove it becomes proof of it it is a closed peristaltic circle ouroboros the worm devouring itself i think sometimes not about how the worm eats but how it is never sated the worm is insatiable dune part two isnt perfect im not convinced by either of its young leads beyond that they look the part im not convinced that one is the leader of men and im not convinced the other has the depth and mystery to win his heart maybe ive aged out of being able to see these qualities in the very young more fatally in the pursuit of clarity im not convinced the picture doesnt fall over too often into oversimplification but the overall effectlanding as the movie does while gaza is martyred to the genocidal impulses of a zionist colonization machine allied with an international cabal of white nationalists note how fishbelly pale the villainous 1930sberlin leatherdaddy harkonnen are and how in this one paul says we are all harkonnen and laughs a bitter kind of laughteris devastating i wonder if the film doesnt actually work better because its hero is swallowed whole by the monstrousness of his position it is an epicallyscaled tentpole from a major studio spending millions of dollars to tell the story of a messianic leader with vengeance on his lips who pulls his power from fundamentalists manipulated by his mothers cult to bring about genocide famine death and war plague that too its suggested via a series of visions paul endures showing a man in his death throes as his mother glides past beautiful and pure and not as she is in the bulk of the film a filthy lady macbeth hunched in secret war council with her unborn child speaking to her in unsettling intravenous closeups from inside her womb dune part two is almost more the companion piece to alex garlands upcoming civil war than its own first partboth films landing in the first third of 2024 like diving bells made brittle in the oceans of our fear and selfloathing this election year how could we have painted ourselves into this humiliating moral corner theres no moral out left for us not anymore you mad fucking idiots best possible choice the lesser of two evils we dont have choice there isnt a lesser evil the worm is overfed and still insatiable
Mar 8 2024,positive,  in the wake of the superhero boom it takes a lot to persuade me to see a bigbudget epic in which the protagonist strolls away from explosions but i read frank herberts scifi classic dune at a tender age and saw the david lynch version on its 1984 release so i couldnt stay away from the 2021 adaptation of the novels first half by québécois director denis villeneuve  or its sequel anyway dune part one ended on a cliffhanger so here we are   previously on dune its the far future but people still duel with swords everybody wants to control the planet arrakis source of the psychotropic substance called spice which makes interstellar travel possible the emperor christopher walken orders the atreides family to take charge of the planet only to doublecross them in concert with their enemy the loathsome baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård with the head of the family dead teenage heir paul atreides timothée chalamet and his mom jessica rebecca ferguson escape into the desert and find refuge with the indigenous fremen   in the second film our protagonists learn to survive in a hostile landscape inhabited by mammoth hungry sandworms leader stilgar javier bardem believes in a prophecy that paul will lead the fremen to paradise not knowing that said prophecy was seeded on arrakis by the bene gesserit the esoteric religious and somewhat superpowered order to which jessica belongs stilgar strongarms jessica into drinking a brainopening substance called the water of life and becoming the tribes spiritual leader young warrior chani zendaya doesnt trust the outsiders who have always exploited her world but paul wins her over with boyish charm and humility   paul and the fremen engage in guerrilla warfare against the ruling harkonnens causing shakeups offplanet where the emperor the baron the bene gesserit and others play highstakes games of court politics everything is headed toward a showdown but will paul really lead the fremen to paradise or only use them to start a bloody galactic revenge crusade   as swordwielding epics go dune is less like star wars than game of thrones there are bad guys  the harkonnens are almost comically evil portrayed here with liberal use of nazi imagery  but there arent many good guys or good girls for that matter everybody who isnt bloodthirstily fighting is ruthlessly scheming from the bene gesserit reverend mother charlotte rampling to the emperors demure daughter florence pugh even paul our supposed hero struggles with a will to power that pushes him inexorably toward violent ends   while the screenplay by villeneuve and jon spaihts takes great pains to lay out pauls internal conflict his character never comes fully to life onscreen hes weighed down by enormous symbolic baggage making this a thankless role to play herberts stiff dialogue defeated kyle maclachlan in 1984 and chalamet doesnt have much better luck with it he comes off as more callow than committed to the roles solemnity as if he might be tempted to break character and start giggling and you cant always blame him   the films real center of gravity is its spectacle the craft with which villeneuve and his crew depict herberts stupendously complex worlds the desert landscape of arrakis has a delicacy and viscerality that recall the days of george lucas tatooine in aerial shots it has a sculpted beauty up close the sand flying in our faces feels convincing the sequence in which paul first rides a sandworm is harrowing and exhilarating regardless of how much cgi went into it the stunt looks genuinely hard the scene is dreamlike and fantastical but it doesnt have the frustrating weightlessness of so many superhero films   the dream becomes a nightmare in equally visually thrilling scenes set on giedi prime the harkonnen homeworld we meet the sociopathic counterpart to paul feydrautha austin butler in a gladiatorial arena straight out of spartacus the whole world is captured in an eerie airless black and white that suggests an 80s music video circle of hell where people wear a lot of vinyl and chains  and kill for fun   with alternatives like these its not hard to sympathize with the fremen even as they transform from scrappy survivors into fanatics by the films climax both paul and jessica have been infected with galaxy brain  a phenomenon herbert seems to have foreseen  and the audience may be worn out a strategic change to the books ending however promises juicy conflict to come   dune is a heady brew but its overweening ambition and weirdness are antidotes to the fourquadrant calculation of so many modern blockbusters ill be back for more   dune 1984 max rentable lynchs compressed adaptation of the novel is lacking in many ways but its steampunkmeetspunkrock aesthetic clearly influenced villeneuves version and as i watched part two i found myself remembering moments in the earlier film that deserve to be called iconic you cant beat sting as feydrautha   arrival 2016 paramount peacock showtime rentable im a fan of prisoners enemy sicario and blade runner 2049 but this moody thoughtful adaptation of a ted chiang story about extraterrestrial communication is still

Mar 8 2024,positive,its impressive filmmaking
Mar 8 2024,positive, directorwriter denis villeneuve knows how to make a throwdown scifi epic he proved that with his captivating production dune 2021 which won six 2022 oscars for cinematography production design visual effects sound editing and score as audiences contemplate this sequel theyll expect the visuals sounds and pacing to be near perfect but what about the storyline script by villeneuve and jon spaihts will it be profound  and how will he treat that heady mix of pageantry and action will he reach higher than before for the first hour thats in doubt depth and exhilaration are missing trying to figure out who is who who hates who and why the factions are so pissed off is a chore but theres a big payoff wait for it  sometime in the far future after a climate disaster water is scarce and sacred paul atreides timothée chalamet wonka the son of a murdered duke and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson mission impossible  dead reckoning duck and hide among the sand dunes on the remote planet arrakis theyre being shepherded by a group of indigenous rebel fighters the fremen led by the warrior stilgar javier bardem no country for old men meanwhile paul has a budding relationship with one of the tribes members chani zendaya spiderman no way home they have love in their eyes but she also has trust issues with the ambitious interloper  at the onehour mark the protagonists their idiosyncrasies and relationships are established the fremens suspicions of paul wane and he takes on an entirely different role in their hierarchy even more important the brutality of the harkonnen evolves viewers are taken to their netherworld away from the earth tones of arrakis to the stark black and white images of a futuristic land run by the venomously evil and very plump baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård mamma mia the ruthless emperor badgers his chief lieutenant beast rabban dave bautista to stop the fremen from ruining his extraction of spice standing in the wings is the barons scheming nephew feydrautha austin butler elvis a heartless and conniving fiend who is so white he looks like he doesnt have blood in his veins when the audience gets an extended view of the enemy and its scheming palace intrigue finally the clash between good and evil becomes fever pitch the stakes in conflicts are clear action sequences intensify with arena fights war combat and killings on screen for all to view are impeccably choregraphed stunts and battle scenes enough to make any scifi head with a lust for movement and mayhem salivate  all those important themes are side issues subplots background details at the heart of the script are human feelings impulses and passion young people in love family intrigue cunning reverend mothers good people fighting evildoers greed vengeance jealousy power grabs deepseated animal instincts complex behaviors  villeneuve is a master at creating and controlling this futuristic world great tastes a great sense of drama passion and motion this is adventure filmmaking at a very high level engaging breathtaking ambitious and filled with grandeur its like hes reaching for the sky  in her interpretation of the courageous chani zendaya finds the conflicting emotions and altruistic motivation that guide her baron is evil incarnate because skarsgård makes him so and its hard to believe that the blanched white evil nephew with the glistening bald head is austin butler from the movie elvis what a 180degree turn if the devil was a man this is what hed look and act like butler masterfully creates this trickery aided by the voodoo magic of a topnotch makeup department 
Mar 8 2024,positive,whether you think youre interested in a scifi or not this is a powerful and quite beautiful reminder of what a stunning medium cinema can still be when enough ambition intelligence artistry  and money  all come together in the same place bravo
Mar 8 2024,neutral, there is much to discuss about part two of denis villeneuves dune adaptation including a deep dive on worm juice in spoiler talk plus rd 2 matchups in 50s madness 
Mar 8 2024,positive, dune part one was my favourite film of 2021 i was captivated by its visuals its scope its scale and the depth of its story as someone who has not read frank herberts seminal novel i was not sure what to expect but the results blew me away now three years later is the followup or more succinctly part two of the story director denis villeneuve has over the last few years firmly established himself as hollywoods premier visual director delivering epic scifi films such as the aforementioned dune blade runner 2049 and arrival and dune part two continues this trend with a grandeur that is nothing short of breathtaking somehow part two manages to up the ante in every aspect including performances to deliver an unforgettable experience in all honesty i did not watch dune part two i experienced it from the beautiful majesty of its visuals to the aweinspiring sound design and the fantastic production design this film was an absolute joy to behold the story this time around focuses on larger and deeper thematic strands continuing the story of part one and taking it to new and exciting and also dark places as we continue following our lead paul atreides played with confident steel by timothée chalamet the full starstudded cast has a part to play and they play it with such enthusiasm and confidence especially zendaya as the warrior chani who is given far more to do this time around and austin butler in an unrecognisable and memorable turn as the villain feydrautha harkonnen though villeneuve is absolutely a visual director there are plenty of smaller character moments that pay off handsomely by the end of the movie though it could be argued that the final twenty minutes of the movie were rushed and i cant disagree the finale felt like a more than satisfying conclusion to this movie story and a tantalising followup to the next film in the saga dune messiah without spoiling anything in this film the messiah aspect of the third instalment will be key as part two deals with a messianic revolution bumping up against more grounded see less religious principles and ideas and the ramifications of every related decision which will prove significant going forward dune part two is a thrilling exciting heavy and intelligent science fiction film that should be celebrated for years to come it will be hard for any other film this year to top the majesty scale and epicness of dune part two and yes this could potentially become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made if dune messiah sticks its landing time will tell but whatever the outcome dune part two is a film that deserves to be remembered and lauded blumhouses terrible recent output has included night swim and five nights at freddys and many would happily include the exorcist believer into the mix and cutting to the chase imaginary can be added to the list in fact imaginary tops the list of blumhouses failures as this is simply a dreadful film imaginary is the type of bland banal uninspired and lazy horror film that is becoming common in the genre as a way of gaining a quick buck for minor output  but this could be a new low how this received a 15 rating in the uk from the bbfc is beyond me as nothing happens literally chauncey  the bear in the marketing  does nothing one person dies offscreen and there are a few hokey jumpscares but other than that its a poorly acted slog about a new family wading through generic drama as alice braun the weird young kid bonds and speaks to a teddy bear for about an hour it then becomes a cheaplooking attempt to capture the magic of older better horror flicks with a crazed abysmal betty buckley gurning and shouting for the camera in an attempt toget chauncey the bear over  they namecheck him so many times that it becomes a parody and they provide him with a warped version of alices voice which was nothing short of hilarious a midmovie therapy session provided a good belly laugh due to this i felt for dewanda wise here as she tries she really tries to sell what she is asked to do and she is a likeable presence in the film as the stepmother who just wants to bond with her new family but nothing is saving this not even tom paynes middleclass english rockstar who plays the worlds most oblivious father before he departs the entire movie to go on tour adds anything how this narrative ended the way it did is mindboggling  who in their right mind would conjure this up and look proudly at it smiling like a new parent and declare it fit for humans to endure hopefully blumhouse can get back on track this year though their next scheduled release is a remake of the excellent speak no evil so who knows what theyll do with that imaginary may work as a gateway horror but even then it could traumatise people who then move on to stronger horror like madame web there is nothing redeemable about this and its one of the worst horror films ive seen in years im left imagining the utopia i lived in before seeing imaginary as it was an infinitely better time move over valek theres a new nun in town sydney sweeneys sister cecilia is the latest asskicking agent of god ready to throw down with the worst that hell can offer actually no she isnt michael mohans immaculate is a religious horror that is not in keeping with recent offerings such as the nun films and prey for the devil in that our lead is not fighting demons or the possessed  instead she is dealing with a miracle  an immaculate conception  following her transfer from her closed parish in the states to a secluded convent in picturesque italy and as the story progresses it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems in the sprawling echofilled convent lit mainly by candles and atmosphere immaculate is a solid slowburn horror until it takes a turn in the final fifteen minutes where it leans fully into its gonzo nature channelling the new french extremity subgenre of years past and delivering a finale that feels bolder than most in recent years sydney sweeney continues her recent dabbling in different genres and delivers a strong overall performance despite an admittedly rocky opening act leading to an allin virtuoso final onetake sequence it should be said that narratively immaculate isnt necessarily providing anything original however its dedication to atmosphere scares and impressive gore keeps this entertaining for the entirety of its brisk runtime that was my main takeaway from the film for a story dealing with heavy subjects and imagery i found myself simply enjoying what i was watching the filmmakers were able to move between moods deftly and i never felt an imbalance in tone  though i do believe an extra ten minutes or so in the final third would have eased its slightly frantic feel or maybe the chaotic nature was just what the film needed to end on either way immaculate was an unexpected curveball given the major recent genre and subgenre outputs effectively crafted with an unnerving score from will bates it felt bold at times and patient at others leading to its gonzo finale sweeney is impressive here and though it may not be perfect it was nuntheless a lot of fun  surprisingly too for the majority of my life bustin has made me feel good great in fact ive been a fan of ghostbusters since i was a kid way back when and it has been so good to see the franchise back on the big screen again following 2016s answer the call and 2021s wonderful afterlife while 1984s original classic was a snarky satire on small businesses and the supernatural horror genre that hasnt stopped sony from expanding on its humble roots now in 2024 we have ghostbusters frozen empire directed by gil kenan this is the first film in the main continuity not directed by a reitman  though jason remains on board as a writer  and finds the whole gang from afterlife ogs included back in new york city to bust a chilly ancient villain garakka who is hellbent on claiming the city and the world as his frozen empire the trailers promised something bigger than before and frozen empire is certainly bigger but unfortunately it is not better it is absolutely an enjoyable romp but one that is overstuffed and a world away from 1984s original in terms of tone vibe and attempts at a grounded feel yes ghosts walking statues and marshmallow men exist hear me out where that film and ghostbusters ii succeeded was in keeping things focused on our crew the schlubs who were just like us but everyone involved worked with the tools they had  frozen empire takes wild detours that explicitly bring the supernatural to the human characters and it is to the detriment of the story the story itself is bursting at the seams from the beginning with too many characters and too much happening there are new villains old characters a focus on phoebes emotional arc a new ghostbusting laboratory and much more as a result of trying to give every member of the cast something to work with no character has a chance to stand out fully and the story suffers the characters and performances are all fine enough grace is again very good as phoebe  though her main subplot featuring a solid lind was horribly disappointing  and rudd aykroyd and nanjiani provide strong supporting performances but the sheer volume of characters means no one has a chance to stand out fully murray oswalt hudson kim coon  all get fun moments but it becomes a mess by the time the big marvelesque showdown arrives complete with a fully cgi villain gozer and vigo worked so well because they were played by actors on set they felt authentic but here the fear factor was lost despite garakkas great visual look now there were plenty of great gags and quips throughout  murray and nanjiani were having a blast  alongside some fun scenes of bustin ghosts including some cool new ghosts and smaller character moments so frozen empire isnt a flop or a writeoff far from it it is very watchable and enjoyable but it is unfocused the franchise seems geared firmly towards families now as its key demographic which is fine as my daughter loved it and this felt like the true start of passing the torch along the supernatural horror parody is gone and the snarky satire of politics and upstart business is gone replaced by a direction that feels more blockbusterfocused kenan and co aimed for something different a risk which should be commended but it didnt entirely work leaving ghostbusters frozen empire as a fun but highly flawed effort
Mar 8 2024,negative, when dune part two 2024 opens with the commandment power over spice is power over all for one brief moment there is an unexpected synergy between dune creator and sciencefiction legend frank herbert writerdirector denis villeneuve and the indian grandmama who is the custodian of heirloom masala recipes after all if there is anyone who will agree about the importance of spice it is she who has mastered indian cuisine and knows how food can be used to nudge others to do your bidding which is precisely the point of the voice in the dune universe ironically what dune part two goes on to falter at are two things that stereotypically grandmothers particularly desi ones have been excellent at storytelling and adding drama to any situation the sequel to dune part one 2021 mostly follows herberts recipe  there are only a few deliberate and significant changes  to serve us a dish that is grand lavish and made with the finest ingredients but is just a little bland ok fine no more food or cooking metaphors grandmama exit left dune part two begins strongly trusting the audience to remember where the first film ended and taking us into the desert planet arrakis which is once again under house harkonnen since the fall of house atreides  much like at the start of dune part one this time too the harkonnen spicemining mission is plagued by guerrilla attacks carried out by the indigenous fremen of arrakis only now paul atreides timothée chalamet and his pregnant mother jessica rebecca ferguson are with the fremen strengthening their ranks some fremen like the endearing stilgar javier bardem believe paul is their messiah others like chani zendaya acknowledge paul is a gifted warrior but the idea of him being a creature of prophecy is something chani chafes against she dreams of fremen being led by one of their own rather than an outsider for paul the idea of being the kwisatz haderach  a superbeing born as a result of the careful breeding programmes carried out by the religious order of the bene gesserit  also feels uncomfortable yet the boy who told his father he didnt want the burden of being the future of house atreides in dune part one now wrestles with a harder more mature desire for revenge to be able to command an army of hardy fremen is a temptation thats hard to resist when you want to take on an emperor even if that emperor is a rather lostlooking christopher walken meanwhile growing inside jessica is a sinister magical baby girl who talks to jessica and is actively plotting pauls ascent to power  none of this should feel boring especially when its being brought to life by a director as gifted as villeneuve and a cast that has the luxury of squandering talented actors like florence pugh and léa seydoux in minor roles to villeneuves credit there are strands of dune part two that are fascinating like jessicas conversations with her unborn daughter fans of the books will perhaps miss the chance to see the abomination  we do get a glimpse of ana taylor joy as alia however she doesnt get any real action in this film  but ferguson is magnificent as the manic and determined reverend mother especially when she has whispered conversations with the foetus whose ancestral memories are sparked into being after jessica drinks the magical and poisonous water of life zendaya as the proud and stubbornly rational chani is also a joy to watch in a role that has been considerably expanded by villeneuves screenplay the way she grapples with her love for paul and the politics she believes in makes chani all the more charismatic unfortunately zendaya and ferguson are only supporting characters in this saga the burden of this epic rests on paul and the spectacles that villeneuve conjures as he realises herberts imaginings onto the big screen in visual terms the imagery of dune part two is often stunning but it doesnt feel as impactful as what cinematographer greig fraser and the special effects team were able to achieve in the first film chalamet though luminous in moments doesnt consistently seem up to the challenge of helming this space opera part of the problem is that there are no credible stumbling blocks on pauls path to greatness its too obvious that paul is the storys overarching hero and in an effort to make a credible messianic leader out of the slight and babyfaced chalamet all the challenges that paul faces are rendered toothless theres never any doubt that the fremen who are initially sceptical about paul will become fans or that paul is going to win every duel even when all the great houses come to vanquish him and the emperor himself shows up the climax feels like an obvious setup to showcase pauls awesomeness obstacles are tackled easily challenges take little effort to neutralise and nothing feels powerful enough to truly challenge paul villeneuve throws gigantic sandworms at us takes us to the harkonnens monochrome planet brings in visions of a terrible war and has chalamet and zendaya canoodle but its not enough to make dune part two feel gripping considering villeneuves love for complex and unnerving subjects its ironic that dune part two feels like a straightforward story about a hero coming into his own rather than a saga of entangled ambitions and thwarted stratagems its tempting to wonder how much more interesting dune part two would have felt if villeneuve had let bene gesserit hold on to its air of matriarchal menace and the film had spent more time exploring the possibilities hinted at when the bene gesserit disclose feydrautha austin butler is part of the orders elaborate breeding plan despite butlers billing villeneuve doesnt let feydrautha grow into a credible threat and even though there are obvious parallels between feydrautha and paul the film isnt able to establish a strong enough connection between the two characters a contest between chalamet and butler could have been a mesmerising watch but even though there are scenes that allow butler to play a flamboyant villain and chalamet to present himself as a ruthless man neither actor is able to make enough of an impact in the books were told that the religious orders original plan was that the kwisatz haderach would manifest in the child born to an atreides daughter fathered by none other than feydrautha jessicas decision to have a son and train him in the bene gesserit ways disrupts these plans as we were told in dune part one paul and feydrauthas duel is a contest between two possible futures two men who are simultaneously drawn to and repelled by one another none of this comes through in dune part two which presents feydrautha only as the bene gesserits backup plan if paul doesnt step up to the role theyve assigned to him when the two finally come face to face the most dramatic part of paul and feydrauthas fight is the bald pate versus an enviable head of curls sinister hairless and eyebrowless butler flares quivering nostrils and grits his impressive jaw to impress upon us how much hes acting but like chalamets attempts at roaring the effect is limited 
Mar 7 2024,positive, the second part of director denis villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts landmark scifi novel is simply aweinspiring it begins with paul atreides timothée chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson hiding out in the desert of arrakis the spicerich planet is coveted by their vicious harkonnen enemies and christopher walkens scheming galactic emperor the story follows pauls odyssey from guerrilla fighter to a reluctant messiah plagued by dreams of a destiny that could ignite a holy war once again chalamet impresses he shares affecting romantic scenes with warrior chani zendaya and convinces as a steely leader ready to wreak vengeance on stellan skarsgards brutal baron fresh faces in the cast include florence pugh and léa seydoux plus austin butler as a formidable new adversary whos introduced in a mesmerising monochrome sequence as with the oscarwinning first instalment villeneuve shows mastery of scale and scope with stunning cinematography and a thumping score from hans zimmer there are also excellent special effects and stirring action not least paul wrangling an enormous sandworm in a breathtaking rush through the dunes
Mar 7 2024,positive, dune part one completely blew me away in 2021 i loved every second of it as a fan of the wider book series i was left awestruck by how director denis villeneuve brought the hostile yet beautiful world of arrakis to life and how deftly he handled the complex and generationspanning story  but dune also left me with a lot of fear yes i know fear is the mindkillerhowever it was justified the second half of frank herberts original 1965 novel is where things really kick into overdrive paul atreides buries himself in the sandy world of the fremen and quickly ascends to become their messiah well and truly kicking off the fight for dune with an odeon limitless membership you can watch every film as often as you like for a flat monthly fee not only that but limitless members also get access to screenings for unreleased movies as well as 10 off food and drink picking up from the instant its predecessor left off dune part two brings viewers back into the shoes of paul played by timothée chalamet shortly after he defeated jamis in a fight to the death  over the ensuing 2 hours 20 minutes or thereabouts viewers are welcomed  like paul  into the world of the fremen how they live how they survive and what living on arrakis really means to them along this journey pauls position as the kwisatz haderach the lisan al gaib a messianic figure with the gift of foresight and limited prescience becomes better known in the wider community religious fanatics fight for him while nonbelievers shun his existence throughout this plot thread chalamet delivers a perfect rendition of a boy with  quite literally  the fate of the entire galaxy on his shoulders he is constantly tortured by the acts of hatred and prejudice being carried out on his people the fremen while also being overcome with the terror of the impending holy crusade those same people will carry out in his name chalamet was glorious in dune part one  but he left the movie and carried out the work all franchise actors ought to he thought about his characters arc and changed his performance in part two as a result everything he does has more weight more angst more dedication watching him is a joy chalamet is magnetic as paul and i cannot wait to see his story continue to unfold in dune messiah beside paul along this excruciating journey is chani his lover and confidant played by zendaya the spiderman star was marketed as a major part of dune part one but ultimately ended up as the focus of various flashbacks flashforwards and a lot of tensionbuilding with an odeon limitless membership you can watch every film as often as you like for a flat monthly fee not only that but limitless members also get access to screenings for unreleased movies as well as 10 off food and drink in dune part two she is a major part of the story  and the film is all the better for it during the picture chani witnesses the rise of this new messiah firsthand and as it snowballs out of control her fear is palpable she stoically heavily and with visible pain tells paul how dangerous his path is and how he ought to stray from it  but it seems his fate has already been set in stone zendaya does a beautiful job of demonstrating chanis battle between her head and heart across the picture  as a result zendaya delivers a powerful performance a bout of simmering anger desperation and forlorn hope as the man she loves struggles with things she cant fully comprehend this is easily zendayas best onscreen performance to date and her future in the series will no doubt expand into further joy there are several new characters introduced into the politics of dune part two as well florence pugh plays the universes politicallycharged princess irulan léa seydoux is the scheming lady margot fenring but none make quite the impact that austin butler does a lot of hype  on and offscreen  surrounded the new antagonist feydrautha played by the elvis presley doppelgänger before the villain is even seen on screen other characters describe him as a madman vicious more when he finally enters stage right he lives up to these rumours  but not much else butler is legitimately scary as feydrautha a monstrous evildoer with nothing but hatred on his todo list so then perhaps his performance is ultimately successful but there isnt much else to latch on to with butler feydrautha carries out heinous and awful actions for the sake of it struggling to create a wellrounded and compelling villain perhaps i need another watch or four but butler was the only part of dune part two i doubted as the credits rolled director denis villeneuve has once again built a world that not only feels viscerally realistic but also looks beautiful stark and begs to be explored further when the canadian maestro finally brings the series third movie dune messiah to the big screen dune part two will no doubt be considered one of the best films of the trilogy and indeed one of the most incredible pieces of cinema in recent memory it is this generations rival for the lord of the rings the two towers it trumps star wars the empire strikes back as the king of modern sciencefiction dune part two is not only one of the greatest sciencefiction pictures of all time it is one of the best films ever made dune part two is the new gold standard for scifi movies and an exciting new direction for villeneuve chalamet zendaya and everyone involved with an odeon limitless membership you can watch every film as often as you like for a flat monthly fee not only that but limitless members also get access to

Mar 6 2024,positive, despite the presence of giant worms and talking space fetuses and numerous flashy fight scenes dune part two is an adult scifi epic that takes its deep and very complex themes seriously throughout its long runtime other tellings of this story wouldnt wrestle so fervently with identity class religion and more the way that they are being tackled in director denis villeneuves film the movie stands as an earnest testament to frank herberts 1965 novel that even further interrogates prickly discourses about saviors the powerful and the dispossessed thanks to the script by villeneuve and jon spaihts but its not all heady conversations and musings on these heavy topics as theres plenty of amazing imagery and exciting action to fully flesh out the world and keep it entertaining there are some parts where that 166minutes length is felt and some redundancy couldve been cut down for the sake of streamlining but mostly dune part two delivers on the promise of the first installment to deliver a genuinely fantastic scifi masterpiece part two picks up immediately where the first one ended with paul timothée chalamet and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson now hiding with the fremen on arrakis with the help of chani zendaya and stilgar javier bardem paul learns their desert ways and how to survive in the harsh environments meanwhile baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård has tasked his nephew rabban dave bautista with squeezing as much spice from arrakis as possible to avoid a similar fate as the house atreides if the emperor christopher walken isnt pleased with production paul is reluctant to embrace and use the prophecies seeded on dune by the benegesserit while his mother is all too happy to employ them to promote her son amongst their new people and keep him safe paul wants revenge against all harkonnens  including newcomer feydrautha austin butler  but doesnt want to use the fremen simply for his own purposes and therefore be another outsider that manipulates them villeneuves sequel both has a lot going on and very little firstly it is entirely necessary to have seen the first part to know what is going on at any given time this isnt a detrimentit was always going to be told in two partsbut it is important to note in this age where installments try to hide that they are sequels or further entries in a larger story even going so far as obscuring the number in the series viewers are immediately plunged into the story and there is never any catch up to acclimate folks to the events of dune but at almost three hours long that exposition isnt missed as deeper themes are discussed it would be easy for this to be the tale of a white savior showing up nonwhite people in their own customs to become an intergalactic hero and thats certainly one interpretation of pauls storybut the script is painfully aware of that as was the book and goes to great lengths to show how the prophecy was actually a source of control and that pauls great reluctance at taking the helm of the leader stems from not wanting to usurp the fremens own agency as the voice of the fremen the one who is distrusting of the religiosity and outsiders chani excels at being fiery independence and tender partner to paul helping soothe that storm that rages within himwhich is all aided by an excellent performance by zendaya all the performances are great across the board with no actor in dune part two lapsing into a onenote character bardem is hilarious and intoxicating as the truebeliever stilgar that wishes paul would be the figure of prophecy that he has been raised to believe in bautistas rabban is a rageful monster but ultimately ineffectual papiermâché mephistopheles that grants his ogre persona with a touch of sadness because of his inabilities ferguson and chalamet find even more layers to their characters from the first movie as jessica and paul change but stay akin to the people we met in the previous installment and newcomers to dune like butler léa seydoux and florence pugh as princess irulan the emperors daughter bring their own flavors into the mix that help further expand the universe and deepen the intrigue of the moving parts at work it is a truly fascinating world that villeneuve has built from herberts universe beautifully captured by dp greig fraser the vast desert can look cruel in one scene and wondrously inviting in the next depending on what is called for the production design and costuming with its many extras and settings is unparalleled in most modern filmmakingat least not since fury road dune part two is a fully realized existence with amazing ideas at work in design that create something alien yet fundamentally human at the same time it is our far future and so has remnants of our dna sprinkled throughout while still revealing new and daring visuals constantly this is all greatly aided by hans zimmers amazing bombastic score with its intense percussion desert sounds and vocal exchanges to create a space that feels othered but still familiar and homelike these visuals and audio are born from our pasts but are fully realized in this remarkable films vision of tomorrow if there is a flaw to dune part two is that around the 23 mark it can feel like that beautifully rendered internal conflict of pauls has been underlined enough and that some of those scenes of anguish and grappling can go on too long but what to cut i dont know theres a famous scene in amadeus where the emperor says that mozarts music is full of too many notes when mozart asks which to cut the emperor has nothing to say to it thats how it feels with dune part twoits probable that every moment is needed to paint this beautiful masterpiece but one cant help but feel that at times it is going a bit long and slow over material already covered this thankfully minor issue is usually quickly resolved by moving on to a new plot development or location with its own dazzling imagery and engaging

Mar 6 2024,positive, the second half of the science fiction movie yes its annoying to only get part of a movie is huge and hugely entertaining its also a series of gigantic setpieces including gladiators fighting in front of possibly the most enormous digital crowd ive ever seen in the movies battles featuring thousands of warriors in outsized spacecraft and palace hallways that appear to go on into infinity i emphasize the movies bigness because its so integral to its appeal theres a lot going on so much that even if you do remember part one you may occasionally get lost but what denis villeneuves movie lacks in narrative clarity it makes up in sheer visual spectacle most of part two must have been created with special effects but somehow villeneuve and his team give it a natural quality so it never conveys the feeling that youre basically watching an animated film what were seeing in part two  which opens in theaters feb 29  cant be real but it always looks like it is thats accomplished by reuniting the creative team that won six oscars two years ago for the first half of dune take jacqueline wests costumes which are appropriately futuristic but which also appear to be handmade west was nominated for part one but did not win as in all of these scifi epics there are plenty of scenes in which computergenerated characters drive computergenerated vehicles past computergenerated backdrops but in dune it feels human slightly messy and organic that comes through most strongly in a couple of scenes in which characters demonstrate their strength during sandstorms in which it almost feels like we too can feel the punishing enormity of the desert winds as in part one the story is simple paul atreides timothée chalamet is trying to restore his family the house of atreides to power and save his peoples future he has help from fierce chani zendaya warrior gurney josh brolin and man of faith stilgar javier bardem but its not always clear where the loyalties of other characters lie including his own mother rebecca ferguson part two introduces new foes including  heres that word again  a spectacular austin butler elvis as feydrautha a sadistic killing machine who makes up in menace what he lacks in eyebrows part two is meant to further explore the perils of something chani says early on you want to control people you tell them a messiah will come they will wait for centuries its a provocative idea but part two loses it in the midst of all the hugeness id also like more of the complicated romance of paul and chani both chalamet and zendaya are powerful performers who can do a lot with a little but every time it seems part two is about to explore the difficulty of maintaining a relationship when youre both destined for greatness we cut to somebody blowing up something a lot of that has to do with the difficulty of finishing a movie that most moviegoers began back in october 2021 when part one hit theaters an emotional reunion between brolin and chalamet for instance will only register if you remember how they parted in the last movie there are also things from the very beginning of part one that dont pay off until the end of part two i guess what im saying is that youd be wise to rewatch the first movie if you havent done so recently and then id recommend seeing part two on the loudest biggest screen you can find

philosopher and historians exhaustive 14thcentury introduction to the islamic world of theology philosophy ecology economics power and politics there is no escaping just how influential it was on frank herberts original dune novel series from desert life versus sedentary culture the rise and fall of dynasties and the diversity of religious practice herbert weaved these weighty historical concepts and themes into a sweeping narrative that delivers an epic critique of the messiah complex now entering part two of denis villeneuves adaptation cowritten by jon spaihts pauls journey towards embracing his manufactured fate comes into keen focus as does the overwhelming mena and islamic influence on the desert planet of arrakis and the fremen its indigenous habitants having survived the devastating attack on house atreides by rivals the harkonnens in dune  part one and the betrayal of emperor shaddam iv who supported the overthrow paul timothee chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson are forced into the desert and taken in by fremen leader stilgar javier bardem this is after paul won a fatal duel against the fremen jamis and much of the 2hr 48 minute runtime is dedicated to his and lady jessicas assimilation into and ultimate leadership over this nomadic warrior people as well as lead a revolt against the usurping harkonnens and the emperor to claim control over the planets spice production  the most valuable substance in the universe one of dune part twos successes is how acutely it wrestles with the scheming efforts of the bene gesserit and the false idolatry theyve for centuries laid the groundwork for jessicas superpowered matriarchal order has spent many generations manipulating the fremen tribes into believing their invented prophecy of the kwisatz haderach aka the mahdilisan algaib  an offworlder who will lead them to their salvation aware of dynastical changes of rule the bene gesserit secure bloodlines of houses to maintain power in the universe but jessicas selfserving plans for her first child by the fallen duke leto i have positioned paul into that messianic role a move that creates friction between mother and son as their paths diverge then realign in the third act ferguson injects some of that doctor sleeprose the hat eeriness into her performance theres an increasingly disturbing glint in jessicas eye as she becomes reverand mother and goes on a holy conversion mission to the south of arrakis the ominous conversations she has with her preborn daughter growing in her womb intensify the weirdness that ferguson revels in searing visions conversations about faith and divination with the fremen and arguments with jessica lay the groundwork for the tumultuous voyage of the mind body and soul paul goes through under the influence of spice that shimmers across the vast desert dunes theres a rich interiority of these particular characters and chalamet compellingly charts pauls emotional evolution from unwilling saviour to pragmatic leader however the biggest motivating factor for accepting this destiny is oddly underexpressed his relationship with chani zendaya also comes into clearer focus and the sweetlooking pair suits the somewhat basic ya romance filter applied to it pauls attempt to mansplain sandwalking to the arrakis native raises a smile but changes from the book mean there isnt an equal exchange of knowledge between the two that truly cements their affections or the genuine depth of their bond to each other  save for an ambiguous headband that might hint at a key plot point that has been erased from this part of the story theres a dearth of character development as to who chani is beyond a member of the fedeykin the fremens fearsome guerrilla fighter group devout to her nation but sceptical of their faith in the novel liet kynes is her father with sharon duncanbrewster playing a genderswapped version of that character here theres zero acknowledgement of that relationship chani is no damselindistress but zendayas ability to connect us to her journey is restrained to a typical strong female characterisation throwing a romantic spanner in the works for the male lead that superficiality is more widespread in the fremen cast little time is spent in establishing these people and their culture beyond fighting survival and religious fanaticism the casting of swisstunisian actress souhelia yacoub is a win for arab representation in a film that restricts actors of mena heritage to background players a nonsensical joke about stilgars accent coming from the south is a reminder that bardem is cosplaying as a bedouin arab bardem offers a warm frequently humorous performance but mostly at the expense of stilgars faith a faith that makes mentions of jinn and is depicted through costumes including abayas hijabs and keffiyehs fergusons imazighen facial tattoos and headdresses hit home not just the cultural appropriation of jessica once she becomes reverend mother but the film too that we are not privy to the secret histories and traditions she has inherited robbed through this ritual is another way the film denies the fremen a more vigorous depiction a visit to the brutalist monochrome world of baron harkonnen stellan skarsgard introduces his sadistic nephew feydrautha who wouldnt look out of place at berlins infamous berghain nightclub austin butler does a decent enough stellan skarsgard impression and throws himself into the vicious role in the medival englandinspired pastures of kaitain florence pugh offers a restrained turn as princess irulan while christopher walkens emperor offers none of the playfulness weve long been accustomed to there are too many characters to do them justice in a film more focused on the grandiose than the granular motivations of its side players or a more fervent exploration of imperialism and colonialism beyond good vs bad and cultural aesthetics still villeneuve with cinematographer greig fraser renders an aweinspiring cinematic space for the battle to continue theres an almost oil paintinglike texture to the arrakis cgi from the majestic sandworms to the ships and freighters attacking the native warriors han zimmers earthy score of heavy drums and ululating is once again oppressive some action sequences are thrilling and stylish an early fremen ambush on harkonnen soldiers is gripping a later fremen attack on a spice harvester in wide shots and intense closeups is riveting but the final battle between the fremen and outworlders not to mention between feydrautha and paul feels rushed and anticlimactic sure the main conflict of this book is somewhat resolved but a true resolution is not sufficiently achieved after spending nearly six hours on dune part one and part two i can say i had a better time with the latter but as a whole audiences deserve a far more satisfying return on their investment
Mar 6 2024,positive,it feels more confident as hes benefiting from the fact that hes done the hard work hes set up the lore and the backstory in the first movie the exposition of like oh look at how this spaceship works  this is why arrakis is important
Mar 6 2024,positive,what is really impressive about part two is that despite how complex and like a miasma the plot becomes the storytelling is so clear 
Mar 5 2024,positive, am i the chosen one and if so does that lead me on a path of destruction also what does my girlfriend think of all this denis villenueves sequel dune part two doesnt waste any time lighting the fires with a nice catchmeup from the lovely florence pugh playing the calculating daughter of the emperor christopher walken having a ball who may or may not carry bigger stakes late in the film it kicks the tires with a breathtaking fremen hijacking sequence as they aim to deflate the spice plants all around arrakis  now if you heard that last line and got a headache let me relieve the pain in the first film paul watched his father and his mighty empire perish shortly after they came to arrakis the desert dunefilled planet that generates and stores spice the diamondshining substance that can extend life offer premonitions and other enhancements in taking down house atreides stellan skarsgards house harkonnen claimed ownership to the spice factories the sequel unfolds with the fremen aka the rebels and original owners of the planet and its gifts shaking the trees of their new dictators  it all comes back to poor young paul who isnt afforded the normal good young times of the runofthemill heir to a throne he lost nearly everything and is slowly gaining it back with chani stigard and his new family but his mother still has power and sway with him and harkonnen has a big weapon dave bautista and a shiny new dagger in austin butlers feydreutha all of it will be coming pauls way as he figures out if hes just another guy or potentially a very powerful being  this relationship also fails to generate a lot of heat at least from my corner of the theater space both actors are good and do create some chemistry but their lack of faith in each other extends to the audience not feeling unwavering in their support of the on screen couple at one point i felt like screaming commit or just fight alongside each other a big part of the films finale centers around the idea of committing to each other in unconventional ways and i felt more tired with these two being a unified front than i did with the films other plot maybe the third film will bring it and them more together the chances of dune messiah getting made have to be solid because the end of this film is anticlimactic dont get me wrong its thrilling and wellfilmedbut its a building block to a third movie that wont be here for at least three or four years things happen in the end but much is left to the next chapter or a future conflict of interests  im not thrilled about that if youre reading this review and wondering if i love this material the answer should be as clear as my addiction to the local baseball team i like and admire the material and its execution far more than i love it so when were two movies and six hours in with only a couple of knots tied the angst in me is real how much more do we have to go will there be a fremen spinoff an origin film about bardems character gosh hes good here the spanish pro can terrify easily in other roles but his veteran leader one who believes firmer than anyone that paul is indeed special offers a poetic nobility to the actors resume but i dont want a movie about his younger self  after dune part one concluded i was left wanting more josh brolin and bautista preferably kicking each others ass bautistas pale evil harkonnen soldier does cross paths with the atreides soldier brolins refugee gurney has ties to paul and his late dad and wants to avenge the latter in the end of part two he does get that shot and crosses weapons with bautistas rabban  and it lasts all of ten seconds a few exchanges and done the victor is for the viewer to discover but it was disappointing i compare it to one of mike tysons shortest bouts on the other hand the climactic fight between chalamet and butler is much better on the whole its not great because it does seem to get itself in a hurry but the actors commit and the choreography is solid how it wraps up is initially covered in doubt and thats due to the ability of the actors and stunt coordinators to get it all right kudos there but not on the brolinbautista faceoff while i would hand the acting prize to either ferguson lets just say i cant and dont want to discuss her arc or bardem the sound is the electrifying element at play in villenueves epic sequel zimmer knows how to inject poignant energy into the loudest and biggest action spectacles something he has done with the pirates films and the dark knight movies here like his work in mad max fury road the score throttles and instantly connects the viewer  the best part of the movie is the first 45 minutes which is a modest amount of action and storytelling thrown together in an athletic yet elegant jam by the master composer if theres a lingering thing from watching this one its the score sticking inside my head it gets you going when the film lags in the middle  i will maintain and strengthen my front that chalamet may not be the second coming of cheesecake but hes a very fine actor who handles the roles progression well am i blown away by him like most no at least not yet hes still very young but his deeper voice and athletic ability is growing and getting stronger a couple scenes near the end cemented the fact that he did make for a sage choice to inhabit the world of paul atreides who is not the most fortunate son he goes toetotoe with butler with the blades but exchanges a key and very incendiary scene with walkens emperor as well the kid can act and these two films showcase that growth heres the thing my friends i still dont love the material or the moviesbut i recommend the sequel based on its kinetic first act overall cast potency thrilling sound and overall satisfying qualities any scene involving the gigantic worms that pop up out of the desert ground will throw a jolt through your system  while i would have craved more closure and wanted the relationship between paul and chani to find some resolution or identity villenueve does a good job with what is seemingly holy grail material its not easy stepping into this world and dealing like he does with this size and scope of ambition and cast but two films in he is does at least make you consider the desire for a third one i just dont sit here dying for its existence even if the ending left a few unanswered questions and details the similarities to star wars is real and that connects to my overall liking but not adoring takeaway from these movies  i agree with you while i enjoyed the movie i felt a bit cheated at the ending which just set up future movies that i may not be that interested in a bit like yellowstone i weary of the long delay
Mar 5 2024,positive, i didnt read author frank herberts dune books the 1984 version of the film by david lynch is decent but i never want to watch it again ive watched dune part one twice and still feel like its boring dune is this massive scifi epic that has consistently been cursed thanks to its dense lore despite its incredible cast and fantastic special effects the sandridden world of dune feels too vast to completely comprehend  and i think its funny that current dune director denis villeneuve recently stated that he hates dialogue when dune part one is twoandahalfhours of nothing but dialogue and set up for its sequel and yet for all my disinterest in the preceding entry and series overall i still plugged in my stillsuit for a trip to see dune part two dune part two picks up almost immediately after the ending of dune part one paul atreides timothee chalamet and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson are still trying to convince the fremen that they belong among them  stilgar javier bardem has many fremen believing that paul is some prophetic savior while the rest of the fremen including chani zendaya believe that the outsiders are spies things arent helped by the fact that pauls intentions are questionable from the start as he claims hes no messiah but rather just a man looking to learn the ways of the fremen in order to get revenge for the death of his father  as for jessica in service of easing these tensions when the opportunity arises she ascends to the role of the fremens reverend mother and proceeds to use her status to help convince her followers of pauls holy status  all the while being pregnant with pauls baby sister with whom she has fullon onesided conversations throughout the film meanwhile as spice production under his watch continues to be interrupted by fremen attacks rabban is demoted from his post as the ruler of arrakis by the baron who in turn replaces him with his younger bloodthirsty and psychopathic nephew feydrautha austin butler while i may not be a fan of the dune series itself ive always found villeneuves other works prisoners enemy sicario arrival to be phenomenal enough to keep me coming back for more same goes for the impressive filmography of dune part twos cinematographer greg fraiser the creator the batman rogue one killing them softly whose films are always beautifully shot the introduction of feydrautha on giedi prime is a particular triumph as the scenes on the planet take place entirely in blackandwhite which provides an intriguing contrast to how sand scenes are often entirely white harkonnen sequences are heavy on black and fullon action takes place in total color further dune part two is far most actionpacked than its predecessor the harkonnen now utilize the ornithopters while the fremen travel and fight using sandworms and while most handtohand combat involves blades the film features countless aweinspiring explosions the wormriding sequence will give you legitimate goosebumps especially if you see the film in imax  the second half of dune part two has far worse pacing than the first its run time overwhelmed with sandy worm worshippers having their heads way too far up their asses not only is timothee chalamet a stronger actor when he has less to work with but paul is also a more attractive as a character when hes humbly learning the ways of the fremen rather than shouting about how great he is chalamets weight as a believable prophet also falters in his weak delivery of louder lines and while dune part two may be a visual splendor its plot feels like it doesnt make a lick of sense the harkonnen material particularly on geidi prime and with scenes involving lea seydoux gives the film an atmosphere akin to that of death stranding  the magnificently bizarre video game that is both gloriously unique and yet probably the dumbest thing to describe out loud dune part two leads towards a holy war but you dont understand half of the stuff people discuss in the film the storytelling of dune feels so elongated and convoluted as between the two films released thus far it shouldnt take nearly six hours to get to yet another cliffhanger ending for what will likely be the most savage film of the entire trilogy especially when the wait between dune films is almost as unbearable as a tenminute conversation revolving around the atreides bloodline impeccably shot filled with superb visual effects and dripping with mostly strong performances from its entire cast villnueves latest will have you almost entirely invested in the dry twisty and monochromatic scifi drama for nearly all of its three hours
Mar 5 2024,positive, if youve felt guilty you never read dune take heart the second part of denis villeneuves epic tells you everything you need to know  and entertains sure there are more subtitles than a foreign language film and enough sand to make the folks in mad max a bit jealous but this is grand storytelling on an understandable scale that doesnt look down on its audience villeneuve in fact makes you feel like its time to jump on board ride the wave and enjoy what hundreds of craftsmen have wrought its a stunning gorgeous film that pulls you in far better than the first film and makes you wonder whos betraying who clearly our sympathies are with paul atreides timothee chalamet the son of a duke whos expected to lead his people and others out of the line of fire and into a place of freedom hes abetted by members of the fremen tribe chani zendaya and stilgar javier bardem who want him to be more than he really is stilgar is allin on the concept of messiah chani has her doubts chalamet and zendaya play the relationship for all its worth and become a team of sorts that doesnt appear to have cracks then another group  house harkonnen  turns up and looks to hail from a professional wrestling world their savior is a creepy fighter named feydrautha austin butler in a great performance who isnt afraid to take on anyone key to pauls intermittent success however is his ability to harness sandworms and ride them to glory think charlton heston in benhur and youll get the picture much of dune part two in fact resembles old swordsandsorcerers films massive crowds cheer on questionable behavior while individuals play out the skullduggery if anything its a look at cult behavior and how it can manifest most of the characters are very superficial and understandable but pauls mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson manages to intrigue throughout shes the product of others choices a climber who wouldnt mind crafting her own legacy villeneuve conjures memories of lawrence of arabia more than once and gets some gorgeous visuals just holding on untouched sand dunes when he introduces those worms the action heats up and chalamet gets to ride to glory part two however hardly seems like the end of this franchise theres a questionable move at the end and enough frank herbert story to launch a star warslevel empire more dune were in particularly if zendaya gets the kind of trajectory this suggests like chalamet shes the industrys hope  a talent who can hold the attention an imax screen demands movie critic bruce miller says dune makes you think plenty of action is about to unfold its a big sprawling film that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible its so interested in setting a tone this dune never really tells a story now as technically fine as it is part two needed to be waiting in the wings ready to unfold at christmas godzilla x kong doesnt have a strong script and its work for the humans is marginal at best still if youre craving popcorn this is your movie
Mar 5 2024,positive, directorcoscreenwriter with jon spaihts denis villeneuve displays firstrate epic chops with dune part two frank herberts sprawling 1965 novel has been adapted for film and television before but it is widely believed that villeneuves 2021 dune part one has been the most successful effort part of that success arguably lay in the fact that the source material was separated into two films allowing enough screen time to tell the story without hacking out crucial bits dune part two begins more or less where dune part one left off the harkonnen dynasty has wiped out the atreides dynasty in order to control the desert planet arrakis arrakis is the only place in the universe that produces the spice that allows interstellar travel extreme longevity and psychic voyaging unbeknownst to the harkonnens atreides heir paul timothée chalamet and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson have both escaped and taken shelter with the arrakis natives the fremen whose own name for their planet is dune paul impresses the fremen with his fighting skills despite her profound suspicion of outsiders fremen warrior chani zendaya is attracted to paul who is also drawn to her fremen leader stilgar javier bardem begins to believe that paul may be the planets prophesied messiah paul and chani are both horrified by this for different reasons paul has nightmares about causing intergalactic war chani believes that a fremen leader should be duneborn and raised and is also afraid that becoming a religious icon will irretrievably change the man she loves jessica meanwhile is a member albeit a rebellious one of the secret allfemale magicusing society the bene gesserit jessica agrees with stilgar about the prophecy and sets about getting the loyalty of the fremen as for baron harkonnen stellan skarsgard hes got nephew rabban dave bautista trying to quell the populace on arrakis harkonnen would like to see his other nephew psychotic but capable feydrautha austin butler take the throne from the current emperor christopher walken thats just the basic setup there is no denying villeneuves skill at creating visual impact the varied spacecraft are fullyrealized intricately detailed replicas of what is described and suggested by the sciencefiction cover art of herberts day so are the costumes and props though they are more intricate than anything conjured in the twodimensional graphics of the 60sthe battles are ferocious and move in breathtaking waves the oneonone fights are superbly choreographed and fluidly executed furthermore there are flights of imagination in both color and design the harkonnen home planet under a black sun is shown wholly in blacks whites and grays combined with the shapes of its trappings it truly comes off as another world most of the cast is also right on pitch first among equals here is zendaya who can convey profound heartbreak or fury without a word ferguson has both wonder and power as jessica bardem is filled with conviction and joy as stilgar butler gives dimension to the predatory feydrautha other notable performances come from florence pugh as the emperors daughter and charlotte rampling as the reverend mother of the bene gesserit its not that chalamet isnt a good actor overall  his choices make sense  but hes simply not on the same pseudoshakespearean wavelength as most of his colleagues this kind of material with characters who know that their actions are shaping the cosmos and who sometimes express themselves in dialogue that doesnt always flow naturally calls for a particular style chalamet is doing something different which isnt exactly wrong but its noticeable something that audiences in 2024 are likely to notice more than either herberts readers or viewers of earlier dramatizations were is dunes great white savior plotline while the characters discuss things in terms of families outsiders and fremen what we see is the brown and black people of dune rallying round the white paul and jessica in this chani is the main voice of opposition granted this is not set on our world but still we either have to roll with it for the purposes of this film or get offboard dune part two is undeniably spectacular whether and how much one is moved by that spectacle depends on large part on what else if anything the viewer wants from it
Mar 5 2024,positive, picking up where the first film left off dune part two is a visual and sonic feast akin to the first that will enthrall the audiences senses paul atreides timothée chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson remain with the fremen led by stilgar javier bardem  paul and jessica are newcomers to the fremen society and are not trusted while some believe paul to be the chosen one other fremen like chani zendaya are skeptical they do not believe that a messiah is coming and they certainly dont believe it to be paul  the harkonnens continue to pillage their way across arrakis in an attempt to take control of the planet while shaddam iv christopher walken is promoting the fall of house atreides his daughter princess irulan florence pugh secretly believes that paul may still be alive but at this point she has nothing to solidify this thought even a conversation with reverend mother mohiam charlotte rampling does not dissuade irulan from her theories  as paul delves further into fremen society including learning their language becoming a fedaykin fighter and riding a sandworm stilgar continues to fill his people with hope that paul is the one theyve all been waiting for however while paul doesnt believe in this himself his mother is set on spreading the word of the prophecy to the fundamentalists in northern arrakis the best thing about dune part two are the performances zendayas chani is the heart of the film and she is given much more to do this time than she does in the previous film her chemistry with chalamets paul is palpable and the shortlived honeymoon phase between the pair makes for some of the films best understated moments chalamet commands the screen particularly in the films third act as he leans into the power he previously claimed he did not want to entangle himself with every line delivery is concise and its easy to see the goodwill that paul may have gained in the first film and the beginning of part two slowly slipping away this could not have been done with such believability if chalamet didnt turn in a pitchperfect performance  however the best of the returning cast is rebecca ferguson as lady jessica ferguson has a charisma about her that is palpable in any film shes acted in and its not different in the two dune movies in part two ferguson does a lot of heavy lifting as her character is most important in moving the films narrative forward every look every line delivery commands your attention and ferguson is astonishing in every moment shes onscreen in dune part two her character is one of the ones to watch most intently as her ambition grows and the her dangerousness builds from scene to scene newcomers to the franchise are austin butler as feydrautha léa seydoux as the bene gesserit lady margot fenring and florence pugh as irulan the trio is excellent as their respective characters butler and seydoux are menacing each portraying their powerful characters with a gravitas that cements their formidability and lets the audience know from the moment their characters appear onscreen to pay close attention to them both while butler has more screen time compared to pugh and seydoux the actresses make the most of their screen time and it will be intriguing to see their storylines expand with the next installment  of course we cannot discuss dune part two without discussing the films visuals and music a treat to both the eyes and ears this film is somehow even better than the first in how it brings frank herberts novels to life from the moment the movie begins it is clear that no expense was spared regarding the visual effects not one interplanetary vessel sandworm or explosion was out of place and in seeing new worlds the monochromatic home of the harkonnens with the black sun was one of the most visually interesting moments in the movie yet again the incomparable hans zimmer brings his agame for the films score the music ebbs and flows easily with whatever is occurring onscreen in heartfelt moments you have a song like a time of quiet between the storms or the aggressive percussion and synth beats of the harkonnen arena  which leaves a feeling of unease throughout that particular segment of course the bombastic and otherworldly are coming to the forefront in worm army zimmers score is impactful throughout the movies entirety zimmers music elevates each and every pivotal scene to new heights that said there are some negatives for the positives in dune part two the films pacing wasnt the best with some sequences stretching on for too long while others seemed over too quickly however the most glaring negative is the same one carried over from the previous film the lack of swana southwest asiannorth african actors in key roles aside from souheila yacoub who portrays shishakli there was also a level of discomfort that came with this particularly when the house of harkonnen which is primarily white was attacking and laying waste to arrakis a planet populated by the fremen who are mostly black and brown citizens  with dune part two showing more of fremen society it is even more glaring than in the first film it is shown in their clothing the way they depict them praying and the language they speak which has very distinct arabic influences in addition to the white saviour trope partly continued from the first film although once you get to the films third act youll see this narrative change this is dune part twos biggest problem for me whether its a film based on the 1989 montréal massacre with polytechnique or following a father trying to find his missing child in prisoners or time to meet god in sicario denis villeneuve continues to show moviegoers why he is such a thrilling director villeneuve knows how to bring a broad range of stories to life and working alongside cinematographer greig fraser for both dune films the pair truly capture a scifi spectacle  with an unforgettable score vivid visuals and powerful performances dune part two is what a scifi epic should be however that doesnt mean it is above criticism  even if the film for the most part was good
Mar 5 2024,positive,in dune part two villeneuve is less subtle with his choices being aggressively vocal about the films intent leaving very little room for ambiguity
Mar 5 2024,positive, dune part two continues the scifi adaptation established by denis villeneuves original dune the novel adaptation is not the first time the story has made its way to the big screen but after dune part two its become the definite version in my mind with almost every aspect of the movie hitting so hard that it leaves you in awe a masterpiece in every sense of the word read on for my dune part two review  dune is frank herberts classic scifi franchise that began with one book and has spawned into a multimedia empire with sequels galore villeneuves dune is not the first bigscreen adaptation with the controversial david lynch movie being the first mainstream one however villeneuve does the impossible by easing audiences into the world of the franchise with the first film and immerses them in its story to completion with dune part two  the story picks up directly after the events of dune with paul atreides timothee chalamet the sole remaining survivor of house atreides joining with the fremen he begins his journey for revenge but at the same time the political machinations of the bene gesseritt via pauls mother jessica rebecca ferguson have more elaborate plans in mind the film is a culmination of what i thought was all set up in the first dune which is what didnt work for me in the first film but here villeneuve closes out the story bringing every plot thread to a satisfying and explosive conclusion  the entire dune franchise and even visually what villeneuve has set up from the first film seems like an epic scifi masterpiece which it absolutely is that but with dune part two we see how its so much more than that while set in a futuristic scifi world the core story is essentially a revenge thriller paul is out to avenge the death of his father and house  but along the way he becomes entangled in the politics of this universe religious fervor and his destiny amongst it all the prophecy of one rising up and being the messiah of the fremen people adds a more abstract fantasy element to this scifi property but how complex that turns out and where it takes the story is truly captivating and thoroughly engaging  i was thrown off by how dune part two is also this epic love story full of some incredibly shot sequences that would feel out of place in any other movie about giant sandworms and hallucinogenic spice but the chemistry between chalamet and zendaya lights up the screen their love story along with the impact it has on the larger story is just one small subplot of the movie that enhances and intensifies pauls journey so much more  i cannot end this dune part two review without discussing the more technical elements of the film its shot beautifully with steady cams frantic zooms and pans that really put audiences into the pov of these rebel fremen fighting for their future within the sands and stones of a desert planet the movie starts with his lowangle shot as paul and the fremen crouch in a sand dune the panning as perspective changes remains low creating an almost claustrophobic feel for audiences but just enough to work within the scene not enough to pull audiences out of it  greig frasers cinematography is gorgeous and astonishingly breathtaking the establishing shots alone are works of art but then when the story is added and the frame fills with characters vfx and music it all becomes something so tangible and aweinducing there are frames from dune part two that could be murals or wall art but will also carry the weight of the story behind them even in a still frame  not to mention the hans zimmer score that will leave you breathless and in awe of what a collaborative medium filmmaking really is a frame of film or note from the score will immerse you back in that world at the moment you originally heard it with all the emotional responses that come with it  dune part two works as an epic conclusion to an introduction in the first dune part two works better as the conclusion experiencing as one cohesive story rather than two parts of one whole the criticisms of the first film become void if experienced one after the other its a story of epic proportions told by an insanely talented filmmaker who knows how to play every moment with the maximum impact on audiences and the ability to pull careernest performances from its insanely massive cast  chalamet shines in a role that i think pulls him out of the comingofage films hes made his career on and into a more mature actor stepping into a new era of his career ferguson is sublime as the overprotective mother who is adding to her sons legacy in her own problematic ways zendaya is intense and loving and has an amazing story arc of her own austin butler impresses as pauls antagonist feyd rautha in a role that is as cerebral as it is physically demanding every performance in dune part two works along with absolutely every other thing about it   follow the mythic journey of paul atreides as he unites with chani and the fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee

Mar 4 2024,positive,finally dune takes proper cinematic shape as the glorious scifi soap opera metaphor intended by frank herbert in villeneuves continuation although its most potent offerings exist in the periphery
Mar 4 2024,positive, dune part two is a triumphant and visionary science fiction film it builds on what worked in the first film and firmly establishes that it has been constructed out of not only an affection for the source material but also a profound understanding of the tragedy at the heart of herberts work this is a story in which a boy becomes a hero and wins it is a story of why that story is a tragedy it paints gorgeous visuals in motion not just of scifi combat and explosions but of a world away from ours in all the small details the rattling suck of air through tubes in the sand the dance of walking without rhythm across dunes the gaping maw of a blacktoothed enemy the skittering glitter of spice blown across the land the crystal clarity of hidden waters the smooth tumble of sand through fingers theres a mesmerizing fullness to the imagery of it being glimpses of a real world that resonates with texture and smell and taste rather than just the hollow glitz of scifi visuals and it embraces the sheer weirdness of the world not as acid trippy as the lynch movie but still reveling in the bizarreness for instance when ink bubble fireworks burst like a celebrating squid above a stadium of alabaster hordes stomping and swaying like an albino nazi rally balloons drop metal monsters the size of apartment buildings into the desert sand worms erupt like cthulhus fingers out of oceans of sand even with the weirdness on display it feels more grounded as the characters are more fully realized than in the first film chani in particular is given a lot more character more complexity than is present in the novel in which she tends to be a motivator and plot device but not necessarily a person thats true of many of the characters to be true herbert for all his brilliance was also a product of his times in science fiction and he wrote in a period where characters were secondary to plots villeneuve deserves great credit for teasing out the emotion of characters without compromising the ideas of making their passions and dreams as important as their moves on the chessboard of power its teasing out that emotion that leads to the greatest success of the movie capturing the sadness at the heart of the story it calls back at times to pauls conversation with his father in the first film in which he expresses such doubts about wanting anything to do with power at a first viewing it read as the cliché of the reluctant hero yes yes you just want a simple life but we know youll rise to be a hero because thats what the story says should happen but what makes this story so powerful what so many have seen between the lines over the decades in herberts novels is that the heros journey is not glory its a trap but its not so naïve as to simply argue that heroes are bad or that fighting evil makes you evil no it argues the sadness that victory always destroys what you are fighting to save the only way to defeat an empire is to be an empire the only way to save the fremen way of life is to unleash them lead them to paradise chalamet says at the moment of triumph and to the shouts of elation with such infinite sadness  but with all that said the film feels rushed even at nearly three hours of run time there is no real passage of time and despite cataloging a whirlwind of events a mere six months or so pass we cant pretend otherwise because of the biological clock that starts early in the movie book readers will know that its timing forced by deciding that alia will not be in this film which is probably a good editorial decision but traps the story in a constrained timeline as with the first film i cannot for the life of me understand how someone who hasnt read the book can follow half of whats going on not just in terms of easter eggs or hidden longer term meanings of events but on a basic level of understanding the basics of what is going on from moment to moment the best i can say to someone who enjoyed the first movie but has not read the book is to trust that the plot does make sense if you look up the answers after the fact and also to tell you to read the damned book already

Mar 4 2024,positive, the review embargo is up i can now talk about denis villeneuves dune part ii which is a much more entertaining film than the first one the scores so far are 79 on metacritic and 96 on rotten tomatoes i was told by warner bros not to mention too much of the plot so i wont really discuss the story at length here all of this to say that dune 2 is pure spectacle filmmaking its as ambitious a studio film as ive seen in quite a bit of time if the first one was all about building character and worlds this one just goes straight for the jugular its partly a road movie as paul timothee chalamet and chani zendaya hide in the mountains of arakkis with the fremen paul is starting to be seen as this messianic figure and word is quickly spreading that he might be the one meanwhile villeneuve manages to tackle multiple storylines in the process the harkonnen who mass murdered pauls family and the atreides have retaken hold of the spice fields the scenes that take place in house of harkonnen are shot in color but photographed in this nightmaresque grey and black the third storyline involves the bene gesserit order and the emperor christopher walken who purposely set up house of atreides fall at the hands of the harkonnen florence pugh plays princess irulan the only person wise enough to realize that her peoples demise might be near what we have here is a revenge story paul wants to seek revenge on the harkonnen and the bene gesserit and to do so hell have to convince the millions of fremen that he is their messiah its a meaty and involving story that involves 166 minutes of tactical planning and constant chess pieces being moved left right and center the cast assembled here helps hide some of the flaws  particularly the overlength chalamet is great zendaya expertly nails chanis inner demons there are also these muscular effective performances from dave bautista josh brolin and best of all javier bardem as stilgar the leader of the fremen herberts novel and the movies tackle religion war revenge and romance these topics are ageless pauls reluctance to accept his fate comes from the fact that he knows that the only way to win and get the revenge he seeks is to also fully inhabit fascist tendencies the only way to conquer evil is to be evil hows that for topical relevance technically speaking dune 2 is a marvel the sand worm sequences have never been more visceral and the breathless scope of the sets are mesmerizingly realized and yet villeneuve doesnt lose sight of the the intimacy of his characters amidst the chaos paul and chani are falling in love but its always tackled in subdued fashion never overbearing to the story at hand  the result is a staggering statement of near biblical approach  a risktaking endeavor to storytelling that threatens to derail at any minute but is kept whole by villeneuves smartly conceived narrative the ending is a bit of a mess but by that point you really dont care as youre fully invested in the stakes at hand  yes there are some dated tropes in dune the book first published in 1965 was one of the blueprints that george lucas used to make star wars and the fact that lucas films have been copied to death by other scifi films doesnt help dunes case for 2024 freshness 
Mar 4 2024,positive, the inevitable analogy of denis villeneuves dune part two as the empire strikes back to dune part ones star wars was recently highlighted by christopher nolan the empire strikes back has become the paradigmatic genre sequel that surpasses the original and the standard by which every ambitious second film in a series is measured and the debt of george lucass star wars mythos to frank herberts dune novels a corrupt galactic empire a quasireligious order with mindcontrol powers etc is substantial enough to make comparisons unavoidable when the sequel depicts the young protagonist going into hiding undergoing intense training and visionary trials and eventually confronting a terrible revelation about his ancestry  all visualized on an overwhelming scale with images of staggering power and utterly persuasive visual effects  the comparison becomes almost redundant yet it would be equally true if not truer to call villeneuves dune movies a kind of antistar wars im tempted to call them the definitive antistar wars movies and dune part two the antiempire strikes back indeed to speak as i did above of the star wars mythos suggests the characterization of the dune saga as an antimyth for all that lucas drew from dune in crafting his galaxy far far away the whole outlook and tone of star wars owes more to inspirations celebrating the triumph of good over evil from conventional westerns and serialized scifi swashbucklers to jrr tolkiens implicitly catholic the lord of the rings by the end of dune part two its clear that while the idea of the triumph of good over evil is popular in some regions of the dune universe that idea is a cruel lie in a harsh cosmos with no lack of overwhelmingly evil forces and machiavellian power players but a dearth of powers worth rooting for villeneuves twopart story offers a heros journey story that throws a deeply skeptical light on the very idea of heroism an instance of what anthropologist manvir singh dubbed the sympathetic plot with a protagonist who is in some ways strikingly unsympathetic and while the jedi mysticism of star wars could be called if not proreligious at least spiritualitypositive the dune saga offers a mixed critique of abrahamicstyle faith in star wars skeptical characters who mock sad devotion or hokey religions sooner or later learn the error of their cynicism in dune part two warnings like if you want to control people you tell them a messiah will cometheyll wait for centuries and this prophecy is how they enslave us come from the most sympathetic and grounded character the young fremen woman chani played by zendaya at the same time perhaps reflecting the directors mixed feelings about his catholic upbringing faith in villeneuves dune films is doubleedged while religion can function as a tool of manipulation and oppression it can also enable people to do the otherwise impossible such as survive in the harshest regions of the desert planet of arrakis its no coincidence that its the uninhabitable south that we find the most devout fremen the ones waiting for a messiah figure faith can even be a force of resistance as florence pughs princess irulen points out to her father christopher walkens emperor warning him against using military force against devout opponents you underestimate the power of faith in my reviews of dune part one and now dune part two filed and pending publication stay tuned ive written a bit comparing and contrasting dune with star wars here id like to consider star wars in relation to the lord of the rings and jrr tolkiens larger legendarium
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune 2 ignites the essence missing from its predecessor with a pulsating heartbeat it weaves characters and worldbuilding into a scifi odyssey akin to a biblical epic 
Mar 4 2024,negative, in dune part two the prophecy of al gaib comes to life muaddib carves the path from boy to prophet and villeneuve sets up a grandiose vision that seems to be focused on the second novel dune messiah unfortunately the film has baffling decisions in nearly every battle sequence during its runtime with stilted fight choreography awful cgi explosions terrible overhead structure rendering particularly in the final portion of the film and inept groundtearing visual effects during its sandworm ride sequences its a wonder that the film isnt more polished in its postproduction visual effects after being delayed from november 3rd 2023 villeneuve capably and reliably convinces when his images are blocked from the knee down but when the vision expands his choices and quite likely his budget limitations keep him from successfully delivering his vision dune part two is a bit oddity its frames are composed in a thoughtful way leading the audience through some of the broader beats of the novel but the characters dont linger their moments fade quickly and the nuances of relationships so important on the page fade and end up mostly seeming immaterial during the film chalamet and zendaya can share a look that satisfies but their actual moments and the content of their speech fail to resonate its like viewing an impression of a human relationship you can see it but you cant feel it javier bardems stilgar is the most resounding success that villeneuve makes as he builds toward dune messiah stilgar the naib of sietch tabr in the film is a slight departure from the stilgar of the books with villeneuves interpretation separating the northern and southern fremen from one another by casting the southern fremen as fundamentalist believers in the bene gesserit prophecy sewn on arrakis bardems devout interpretation of the character throughout the film is an effective choice that villeneuve makes in his somewhat altered vision of the first dune novel and accomplishes a significant amount of heavy lifting for a third film should there be one the first dune film from david lynch while flawed in many ways did have an element of humanity to it a quirkiness an aliveness that is absent from villeneuves adaption for all his formal competence i cant say that i find this rendition to be any better than the 1984 adaption sometimes campiness can be a feature not a bug and the sterility of this interpretation has me longing for that seemingly more human and jovial interpretation of the text than this mathematical and distant one  despite the films various faults chalamets portrayal of paul is effective his performance conveys the journey from boy to kwizatz haderach as well as anyone could imagine when the film centers on real locations and real structures and props greig frasers cinematography and villeneuves vision come through clearly unfortunately the film is heavily reliant on visual effects that often look poor at best
Mar 3 2024,positive, it may only be march 1 but this feels like this could be the most anticipated film of 2024 dune part two is finally here and playing constantly at a theater near you as visually and technically impressive as any film you have ever seen this is true cinematic craftsmanship and everyone is working at the top of their game it is hard to believe dune devotees will not absolutely love this the early reactions have been insanely positive and there are so many moments that people will be talking about for a long time ill quietly wait my turn and ask are we not being seduced by the expansive vision and presentation of dune and giving a pass to the delivery of the actual story do we even care about the story all that much if the 2021 dune was not your jam dune part two may impress you more from a cinematic standpoint but there isnt much here to change ones opinion im not alone in believing the big barrier for a lot of people to conquer with dune is that the characters and inherit connection to said characters remains at an arms length though villeneuve gets strong performances from an impressive cast some find it hard to retain remember and invest in the paul atreides story  the northern lights the great pyramid machu picchu the eiffel tower the statue of liberty dune part two having spent a few days on filmtwitter and watching the film side of tiktok here is what i can surmise when it comes to reactions to dune part two this movie is among the greatest visual sights that a human eye can witness also this is apparently the greatest sequel of all time and as one x user and movie reviewer tweeted dune part two isthe most visually impressive movie ive seen  an assault on all the senses to be fair the already infamous popcorn bucket to promote the film may be an assault on all the sensesbut i digressseems that people have lost their everloving minds over denis villenueves sequel to 2021s ambitious expansive sixtime oscar winner in completing the rest of frank herberts substantial 1965 sciencefiction novel dune part two is the latest example of a film that someone cannot love enough i know this firsthand  i heaped praise on it for a good three or four minutes with someone who has also seen the filmonly to then be asked why i did not like it some of us have been down this road before with 2015s mad max fury road a cinematic juggernaut that has developed a cultlike and rather cutthroat fanbase apparently that film and dune part two are perfect movies in that case i suppose our work here is done once you encounter the perfect version of something there is really nothing left to discuss or analyze rightat the risk of committing blasphemy or some form of cinematic treason i would suggest to filmtwitter and filmtok and everyone else within earshot that dune part two is not perfect yet i recognize that the hyperbolic reactions come from an understandable place villenueves sequel is cinematic excellence staggering and breathtaking to watch on a big screen in this installment the story is not bogged down as much by the need for incessant worldbuilding dune part two is more accessible less convoluted and full of performances which may define careers timothée chalamet for example may henceforth become synonymous with the name paul atreides as mark hamill is with luke skywalker and a young harrison ford with indiana jones a groundbreaking work of art the craftsmanship the technical aspects the vision and scope is all exceptional dune part two is an embodiment of filmmakers in nearly every capacity functioning at the top of their gamewho knows  it might even be possible that the 2025 oscars may have already found its next best picture winner before 2024s winner is even announced when you dig deeper and delve into the execution around the storytelling thats where gaffes and blemishes start to surface i will humbly ask this do we really care about the story or are we just blown away at a really amazing exhibit of images sounds and spectacle to me though a more engaging and impressive achievement than the 2021 opener part two still feels like a film trying to find the emotional ties it needs to truly embed within our hearts and mindsherberts book by the end evolves into a story of religious fanaticism and honestly to me can be largely reduced down to the old cliché that absolute power corrupts absolutely in paul we have a character who continues to be shown a darker path seduced by a more nefarious approach to help solve the perceived ills of his kingdom as the dust jacket closes on herberts novel paul has embraced a bleak somewhat shocking path and here we see his moves partially guided by his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson forgive me if i wonder out loud whether her story might be the most interesting story being told in dune part one and two silly me there i go questioning perfection again having spent a few days on filmtwitter and watching the film side of tiktok

Mar 3 2024,positive, there is perhaps nothing more exhilarating than nearly three hours trapped in a chaotic futuristic universe i might be in the minority on this one but i could spend a solid hour staring at sand when writerdirector denis villeneuve is behind the camera it helps that in this case the story he develops is complex in imagery with worlds creatures and evolved humans that require extensive time in the makeup chair and postproduction there is so much food for fodder and in this metaphor villeneuve is a michelinstar chef but the story is also universal in its themes of good triumphing over evil and fate versus free will there is something for nearly everyone a complex political landscape filled with ancient royal families from different planets yes please epic sweeping shots of a desert planet guarded by omnivorous gargantuan worm monsters oh yeah a truelovedoomed storyline harkening straight back to shakespeare swoon top it off with a hairless eyebrowless inktoothed austin butler and you can sign me right up for my fellow scifi worldbuilding juggernauts dune part two is pretty darn perfect  the first installment was a favorite of ours back in 2021 part two is the sequel of all sequels with a nearly threehour runtime the film simply cannot give us enough paul atreides timothée chalamet the prophesied messiah of the freman people his journey to accepting his predetermined fate is a tale nearly as old as time though it will feel like a familiar plight dune was written by tacomaborn frank herbert some 10 years before star wars and 30 years before harry potter paul atreides is therefore the og of young white male saviors preordained for greatness in chalamets hands and perfectly coifed curls ive become a dune convert in case you forgot the young atreides has been forced out into the brutal desert landscape of arrakis a planet highly desirable for its natural resource known as spice its a highly addictive substance that has become essential to life 20000 years from now it can only be harvested in the conditions on that planet which means various political families are vying for the privilege of overseeing the mining efforts but the foreign powers are hit with resistance by the fremen a subculture of humans who have adapted to live on arrakis most uninhabitable regions surviving on little water and moving within the sand as easily as a bird in the sky they are selfappointed guardians of the planet led by stilgar javier bardem their bright blue irises are acquired by their long exposure to spice and their belief system revolves around the imminent arrival of the lisan al gaib the son of a bene gesserit an ancient society of powerful women who have harnessed supernatural mental and physical abilities as the myth goes the lisan al gaib will one day appear on arrakis and lead them to freedom and paradise paul atreides  or as i like to call him for all my fellow potterheads the boy who lisan al gaib  sits precariously at the center of the action he is the sole heir to one of the most powerful family dynasties in the solar system he is believed to be dead by all except the fremen who have taken him under their wing and he has the immeasurable powers inherited from his bene gesserit mother jessica rebecca ferguson to lead the fremen in revolt against the status quo he alone is ready to contend with the corruption of the emperor christopher walken and his greedy underling baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård the leader of the house assigned to usurp pauls family as arrakis slave driver of all the characters receiving fuller arcs in this film jessica is by and far the most wild metamorphosis she transforms from a relatively shy and insecure mother and wife to a conniving omniscient and authoritative reverend mother of the fremen this process requires drinking the poison pulled from a sandworm and experiencing spice agony thereby awakening her other memory to see the future ferguson has proven her versatility throughout her career but this role really shows audiences her fierce control of every scene shes in and the emotional manipulation she commits without letting anyone in on the ruse  that could be said of much of the cast as well there isnt a weak performance or unsteady singular moment in the film austin butler makes his appearance halfway through as feydrautha baron harkonnens nephew we saw and heard butler mutate into elvis last year and in this film his voice pitches to impeccably imitate skarsgårds swedish accent at times its hard to forget he isnt one of the skarsgård brothers we see frequently in similar evil roles aided by facial prosthetics and movie magic butler terrorizes every time hes on screen despite its many side stories and intricate family trees the plot of dune is as straightforward as it comes there are very obvious good guys the oppressed fremen seeking liberation and even more conventional bad guys the fearinducing harkonnen whose hairless bodies look to have never seen the sun and whose merciless and cruel tendencies make them feel like distant cousins to voldemort the forbidden love between chalamets paul and zendayas chani is a nice touch to round out the story as much i enjoy zendaya her role here is more as a dissenting viewpoint to the other fremens fawning adoration over their messiah shes also a combative romantic interest who challenges paul if he werent so focused on i dont know saving an entire population of living souls this could almost be a happy love story but alas its not a romcom this is as high fantasyscience fiction as they come and thankfully in the hands of visionary villeneuve this continuation film is told with spectacular special effects an epic setting solid performances and a script that steadily develops these largerthanlife characters until viewers will feel like they are eyewitnesses to the future it would be helpful to have seen the first part but even without the context part two is a breathtaking trip to another world a fever dream from which we never want to wake
Mar 3 2024,negative, dune part two hits the ground running well make that walking paul atredies timothée chalamet and his bene gesserit mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson are in the hands of fremen leader stilgar javier bardem as he shepherds them to safety across the northern desert of arrakis theres nothing in the way of a recap but im not certain one is required paul and jessica are on the run from the harkonnen and winning the trust of the fremen is the key to their survival thats basically it of course frank herberts sprawling source material is far more complex than that and much like they did with 2021s academy awardwinning dune filmmaker denis villeneuve and cowriter jon spaihts have gone out of their way to transfer as many of the authors themes and subplots to the screen as they can this adaptation of the second half of the book is a sprawling visually dynamic affair and it overflows in outstanding moments and with sequences of auditory brilliance however much like its predecessor i found this sequel frequently cold and emotionally barren at the most inopportune times the second half is particularly monotonous as paul trudges toward a destiny he does not want and presciently believes will be his damnation  and by extension the universes villeneuve stages several eyepopping set pieces but then all too often resolves them with abrupt suddenness the film is all exhilarating buildup leading to an unsatisfactory and even somewhat perfunctory payoff while i was impressed with the directors cinematic gusto i was equally disappointed by how little i cared about the majority of the characters or their plights not that i thought any of this during the pictures opening half it is during this section that paul settles in with the fremen and starts becoming a valuable asset in their fight against the harkonnen chalamet is at his best here and whether its bantering back and forth with a surprisingly relaxed and often very very funny bardem or working toward a thorny romantic entanglement with zendaya returning as the respected fremen warrior chani the foundation he fabricates for pauls eventual transformation into the fabled kwisatz haderach is a solid one everything builds to the moment when paul  now known by the fremen as muaddib  must pass a final test of manhood and ride a sandworm its also the most noticeable instance in which villeneuve uncorks a sequence of jawdropping kinetic magnificence  only for things to conclude with an unfinished thud paul calls the worm composer hans zimmer the creator conducts his intensely confrontational score with vitriolic urgency cinematographer greig fraser zero dark thirty crafts one aweinspiring image after another and the line between practical and computergenerated visual effects vanishes entirely but while all of this looks and sounds stunning there is no emotional payoff villeneuve quickly moves events along to focus on other characters and additional subplots considering theres so much story to be told this isnt shocking in the same breath keeping things in such an unfinished state robs paul of the necessary interior nuances that make him such a troubled and fascinating protagonist this is a man who wants no part of the prophecy he is at the center of fearing that becoming a messianic leader will only lead to ruination for everyone he cares about it drove me nuts to have so many bits where paul fulfills an aspect of said prophecy for a momentary need only for them to gloss over the longterm ramifications its not just paul who falls victim to this form of narrative shorthand with the beast rabban dave bautista failing miserably to control the fremen on arrakis baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård turns to another nephew the bloodthirsty feydrautha austin butler to turn the tide back into their favor butler is suitably psychotic in the role and from the first second he monochromatically steps into the frame i found it impossible to take my eyes off of him but the gladiatorial combat hes introduced in is a major letdown while a later assault he leads on a fremen stronghold happens because the story needs it to its the catalyst to get paul moving from north to south and does nothing to develop the villain beyond the plainly obvious the same goes for padishah emperor shaddam iv a game if miscast christopher walken and his bene gesserit daughter princess irulan florence pugh the sections involving them rely heavily on voiceovers from pugh as she recaps events in her diary and these scenes have about the same impact on the proceedings as virginia madsen portraying the same narrator did on david lynchs 1984 adaptation ie practically none there are exceptions to all of this and that is part of what makes dune part two so monumentally vexing irulan has a heated têteàtête with bene gesserit reverend mother mohiam charlotte rampling and pugh and rampling bounce off one another with masterfully modulated subtlety theres another bit between butler and léa seydoux that is dazzling the latters seduction of the former having an arachnid virtuosity thats unlike anything ive seen in ages finally and maybe most important of all the scene in which paul finally takes charge of the fremen during a giant meeting of the clans is well worth the wait and the full magnitude of what he is doing is portrayed with a noticeable undercurrent of tragic inevitability that mirrors herberts source material nicely then there is zendaya shes superb chani sees what is happening and knows she should not be falling in love with paul and yet no matter the danger she cannot help but do so anyhow the actors eyes are always probing consistently questioning zendaya has an uncontrolled fire kindling within her lithe athletic frame and its a constant guessing game as to whether shell be able to keep it from exploding this is the best performance of her young career so far villeneuve has guts he does not shy away from the darker aspects of herberts prose and while i could have done without the blatant cliffhanger setting up the next chapter of this saga which will undoubtedly be pulled from the authors dune messiah i respect that the director delivers a downer of a climax if i felt more of an attachment to anyone other than chani i probably would have applauded this ending as some in my small screening audience did but that wasnt the case while ill journey back to arrakis with villeneuve for a third time when the opportunity presents itself im no longer nearly as excited about making the trek and thats too bad we are dedicated

Mar 3 2024,positive, legendary pictures and warner bros discovery have a blockbuster hit on their hands as dune part two debuts to more than 80 million at the domestic box office and rave reviews from critics and audiences which is understandable and expected as writerdirector denis villeneuves and cowriter jon spaihts sequel to the acclaimed 2021 dune is a thrilling glorious scifi masterpiece financially this one isnt too hard to call at this point while there are a couple of million of dollars worth of variance dune part two will end the weekend with about 82 million domestic  overperforming slightly as id expected  and up to 90 million internationally but well have better numbers for that tomorrow with major foreign markets to come including china and japan the final freshman bow total should be somewhere around 165 million but could go as high as 170 million update international box office is indeed coming in on the highest end of predictions near 100 million and likely to finish at least north of 95 million even if dune part two has the same modest final multiplier as the first film at 26x despite lacking a recent covid pandemic surge from a new variant and the simultaneous streaming release of the film on hbo max after leaking online a week prior to theatrical that would put the sequel north of 200 million domestic by the end of its theatrical run since part two has superior audience scores and critical reviews and with even more premium screen at higher ticket prices somewhat offset by a slightly longer runtime and thus less daily screenings in some venues i expect at least a 3x multiplier in the end for at least 234 million in north america international markets are good for 80 million minimum and possibly 90 million or more at a 26x multiplier foreign sales would add around 221 million but that jumps to 255270 million if the film performs at better levels based on audience scores and pricing remember this is without china or japan which will add tens of millions more to dune part twos global haul as well  the two nations combined for 46 million for dune but even without them were still already talking about potentially 489500 million or more so lets call it 545 million this is just an easy and modest calculation of dune part twos potential while we cant dismiss the chance it might generate less longterm positive word of mouth thus hold less strongly week to week and wind up less popular overseas which is all to say it could be a nice blockbuster level hit but at the lower level of about 500 million thats different from a huge breakout hit that gets within shooting distance of 1 billion territory though its good for wbd and a testament to the filmmaking that its probably going to perform at least in the 500 million range and start the year off well but what warner wants is something that blows the doors off the box office and that depends on just how good dune part two really is if its great enough we could be talking about box office results far higher for the franchise lucky for everyone involved dune part two is spectacular and likely to become one of the years most talkedabout successful and acclaimed releases i cannot fathom any other film this year could possibly compare to the cinematography and visual effects in part two which are beyond even the monumental accomplishments of the first film this is what movie theaters exist for this type of visual and complete story immersion christopher nolan is among those whove compared dune part two to star wars films particularly the empire strikes back but i think its far more comparable to the lord of the rings trilogy in terms of tone style and the vision behind it i actually find the first dune film to be more akin to the empire strikes back since it ended on more of a cliffhanger note and didnt quite feel like a complete contained story of its own whereas dune part two works even if there is no followup this story has been told now though we know there is inevitably more to come in the world of dune whether we wind up seeing it or not but of course well see it the only question is how soon with the excellent box office results we can expect to see it sooner than later id bet this film is all villeneuves vision and in experiencing it we can more fully and clearly see the vision and intentions within the first dune which i gave a mixedpositive review at the time as feeling like only the setup part of a story that we werent even sure wed see finished and not for at least a few years character arcs and interactions felt incomplete and frustratingly narrowly drawn within the context of plot points as opposed to relationships but dune is a film that rewards repeat viewings and once you know the story  and know youll finally see the rest of the story imminently  you can watch it and let the film flow over and through you let the visuals carry you and stop trying to recall every name and term and reference my high hopes and expectations based on the first films trailers were an obstacle to my ability to fully embrace and enjoy that movie but now with dune part two the storytelling embraces us we are drawn in and surround by it we are not immersed but rather consumed by the richness and depth and undeniability of it all scale and scope are not merely visual and auditory in part two although indeed the visuals and commitment to relying on imagery and action are of mythical godlike scale within that sense of enormity and endless sand desert and sky villeneuve and brilliant cinematographer greig fraser also find that sense of the personal scale of humanity trying to survive in the vast expanse of this world theyve created we are awed mesmerized by the sight of mountainous spacecraft descending over a city of gargantuan alien worms rising and towering over us but inevitably our attention is always drawn to the people confronting the scale  the ships the creatures the planet the universe the political equations and deadly wars they dwarf us yet are beholden to the choices and demands of these characters who bend reality to their will that is dune part two a tale of humanity surviving resisting prevailing against impossible odds and a natural worlduniverse full of extremes and threats that wear and batter us down from the cold indifference of space to the inferno of arrakis my only quibbles are minor in the grand context of dune part twos amazing visionary success the spice and its impact the surrealist sensibility of how spice is used for space travel gets little attention here control of spice is used as a framing device yet only pops up as a notable plotpoint or topic of discussion occasionally giving way to the more personal and political elements and of course the religious themes dominate id like to have seen a little more effort to work in the uses of spice and how obsessed with it the political situation is there are also many moments where the dialogue  which i know is of generally lower interest to villeneuve  is very formal even in casual settings and moments of tension or urgency so it sounds more like reading from a page than someone speaking naturally this also makes a few jokes of which there arent many to be sure as it wouldnt feel remotely appropriate in this type of story and filmmaking feel tonally incongruent with the rest of the storytelling approach but i also realize some dialogue choices are affectations related to the tonal impression of the film and its foundation in theocracy and formalized rituals i just think there are several scenes that wouldve played more smoothly with rewording of the dialogue  and frankly some of these moments couldve just done with even less dialogue or none at all when i rewatch the first dune film from 2021 all of its flaws seem minor now while its best elements stand out and define it it improves with age and its only been three years im grateful to be able to watch it now with new eyes and even happier that i can now consider and appreciate it alongside its second half to form a whole dune part two is a testament to the power of cinema as transformative immersive storytelling see it on the biggest screen possible but please wear a mask we are still in a pandemic as well as suffering from rsv flu and other illnesses still spreading sit close open your mind and be transported to dune desert planet

Mar 3 2024,positive, dune part two continues the science fiction saga that follows a young duke on his path to lead a rebellion and regain his familys position frank herberts dune is an awardwinning classic scifi saga with so many moving parts its impossible to capture all of the nuances in a standard twohour film thus its been adapted into miniseries and multipart movies in an attempt to incorporate as much of herberts universe as possible some of the details that make it so difficult to portray on screen are the complex political scientific and social models that compel almost every action in the narrative so filmmakers can either get bogged down in trying to explain it all or opt for a highlevel overview supplemented by new character arcs in dune part two director denis villeneuve chooses the latter paul timothée chalamet and his mother jessica rebecca ferguson successfully embedded themselves amongst the fremen mostly thanks to stilgar javier bardem who believes they could be the manifestation of a longheld prophecy and chani zendaya who teaches him the way of her people as the pair reluctantly accept their roles as messiah and reverend mother respectively the war for the spice and control of arrakis rages on beast rabban harkonnen dave bautista is struggling to maintain the barons stellan skarsgård support as his ability to harvest the spice is repeatedly frustrated by fremen attacks led by the newly named muaddib so his uncle redistributes the planets control to his other nephew feydrautha harkonnen austin butler who has a much colder approach to ending the conflict which will force pauls hand and possibly bring forth the devastating holy war hes foreseen in his dreams this film is clearly influenced by the 1962 epic adventure drama lawrence of arabia which told the reallife story of a british soldier that played a significant role in the arab revolt there are scenes in villeneuves movie that strongly resemble those in its predecessor from pauls overwhelming reception by the fremen to him leading them into battle against the occupying house harkonnen moreover though herbert wrote the original story in 1965 its not surprising to see parallels between the movie and current world conflicts pitting indigenous peoples against invading forces the first installment of this series attempted to establish the various houses and the reasons for tensions between them losing some viewers as it conveyed the complexities of their relationships and the significance of their conflicts within the big picture this second part disregards most of the storys nuances in favour of stunning action sequences that engulf the screen with battles and explosions and feature the mightiness of the monstrous worms that inhabit the planet the sound rumbles through the imax seats and immerses audiences in the cinematic spectacle for anyone not familiar with the source material the movie will seem less confusing and more enjoyable conversely fans will be disappointed by all thats glossed over altered or omitted completely yet the most upsetting change is made to chanis character and her relationship with paul in herberts book shes supportive of pauls cause and they openly discuss the hard decisions he will have to make if he continues down this path in the film chani explicitly opposes pauls actions and he behaves very uncharacteristically towards her fostering trust issues between them while there are many changes to the narrative including a much briefer timeline that modifies the entire existence of some characters driving a wedge between paul and chani is the most egregious in their attempt to give chani more agency and strengthen her character they lose one of pauls foundations and most important confidante villeneuve has mentioned making a third film based on herberts second book dune messiah but so much that is at the centre of that narrative has been removed from this story its difficult to imagine how the two could be reconciled copyright  1998  2023 digital journal inc sitemaps xml  news  digital journal is not responsible for the content of external sites read more about our external linking 
Mar 3 2024,positive, if theres another blockbuster this year that matches the visual impact of denis villeneuves dune part two ill eat my desert boots the second dune instalment is jawonthefloor spectacular it elegantly weaves together toptier special effects and arresting cinematography it layers muscle sinew and savagery on to the bones of part one its an inhospitable brutal kind of beauty that villeneuve has created  theres not enough lip balm in the universe to make a visit to the sandblasted wilderness planet of arrakis look appealing but this epic action picture which follows the journey of paul atreides timothée chalamet from a cheeky whippersnapper whos a bit handy with a sword to a feared warrior to the prophesied leader of the fremen tribe of arrakis is realised with a retinasearing intensity so how is it that villeneuve has been able to succeed  and make no mistake dune part two is an emphatic success  in adapting a book that was long considered to be unfilmable the breadth and scope of dune frank herberts 1965 farfuture saga of interstellar feudal conflict proved a daunting prospect to previous prospective filmmakers the generous budget available to villeneuves pictures certainly helps  the lack of funds was the factor that sank alejandro jodorowskys proposed 14hour film adaptation of the book in the early 1970s and studio support is another  while warner brothers hasnt exactly covered itself in glory recently as anyone who has been following the coyote vs acme debacle will know it has at least given villeneuve the space and freedom to achieve his creative vision compare this with david lynchs less happy experience with his version of dune originally intended to run at three hours then unceremoniously hacked down by nearly 40 minutes but a crucial element in villeneuves approach a creative ethos that gels particularly effectively with the material is his firm commitment to showing rather than telling a chunk of exposition at the very start of the film delivered as an entry into the imperial diary and narrated by princess irulan florence pugh neatly proves how futile it is to attempt to unpick the intricacies of this densely plotted chronicle in this case too much dialogue and plot explanation drain the energy from the picture its far more effective to employ villeneuves preferred tactic of exploring the story visually this technique occasionally misfires with some of the transitions between vividly created scenes and set pieces feeling a little cursory and disjointed but on the whole it does no harm at all to bathe the audience in heady coloursaturated atmosphere rather than to spoonfeed them with easily digestible gobbets of plot although paul is the main focus of the story this instalment allows other characters to come to the fore most notably fremen warrior chani an impressive physically committed performance from the always magnetic zendaya but a standout in a supporting role is austin butler playing feydrautha the psychopathic nephew of stellan skarsgårds levitating despot baron harkonnen a vast seatshuddering spectacle like this movie is no place for subtlety and butler evidently got that particular memo from the moment he tests the calibre of a freshly sharpened blade with his extended tongue before trying it on the throat of one of his slaves he is phenomenal its a gleefully overthetop performance fuelled by malice and channelled through axeblade cheekbones and a smile that could strip the skin from your face equally impressive and only slightly less disturbing is rebecca ferguson reprising her role of lady jessica pauls mother driven by her ambition for her son and twisted by the gruelling ritual that transforms her into the reverend mother of the fremen jessica takes on a chilling ruthlessness something that ferguson manages to convey almost entirely through an icily inscrutable gaze and a collection of facial tattoos the immense breathtaking visuals and the grandstanding performances are more than matched by hans zimmers behemoth of a score there are passages so thunderous it sounds as though he somehow harnessed the noise of colliding planets in place of percussion its a fittingly ominous accompaniment to a story that lurches away from passionate idealism truth and romance and towards political machinations betrayals zealotry the weaponisation of fear and the looming threat of a devastating religious war there are moments when dune part two feels uncomfortably timely
Mar 3 2024,positive, coming out of the first dune anyone familiar with the novel  or david lynchs uneven but underrated 1984 adaptation  had a few questions about what dune part two would hold for one the first film had used up most of the plot leaving little more than an escalating series of battles and the growing misgivings of paul atreides timothée chalamet to fill the back half how would director denis villeneuve turn that thin gruel into an epic worthy of the name rather than simply pad things out with fresh subplots or new characters though dune part two does feature both villeneuve doubles down on going big call it a vibesbased approach to storytelling overwhelming visuals and a pummelling score work hard to give this a constant bonedeep sense of profundity and meaning even where the story itself is just a series of rebel attacks on farm trucks as for the story now hiding out with a band of fremen led by stilgar javier bardem paul and his pregnant mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson  the last survivors of house atreides sent to rule the economically vital planet arrakis as part of what turns out to have been a murderous trap laid by the emperor christopher walken and rival house harkonnen  gradually come to be accepted by them and are initiated into their desert ways lady jessica becomes a reverend mother a figure of much power while paul grows into the role of warrior and leader he also gets to ride around on giant sand worms who move like fastswimming whales barely breaching the surface some see him as the foretold messiah a mantel he struggles against  mostly because he knows the beliefs origins in manipulative propaganda spread by the bene gesserit the secretive and powerful sisterhood his mother is a member of while the harkonnens now back in charge of the planet alternate between sending out raiding parties and killing their own underlings under pauls leadership the fremens attacks on spice production grow bolder and more effective the call grows for paul to travel south and drink the water of life a potion that usually kills men but may  if the prophecy is true  give him the visions he needs to free the planet already paul knows going south will lead to a galaxywide war that will kill billions when the harkonnens bring in the even more ruthless feydrautha austin butler to crush the resistance he may no longer have a choice despite the desert setting theres not a whole lot of warmth in the performances bardem being a notable exception even the return of josh brolins gurney doesnt add much of a human dimension to what is increasingly a series of galaxyshattering power plays to be fair thats to be expected the arc across the two films is a journey from the relatively small and intimate to an upfront clash of massive armies and centuriesspanning schemes even the growing romance between paul and fremen chani zendaya is more of a friendship with benefits than any epic passion but as young lovers together against the galaxy theyre a good team at least until paul takes the first steps towards godhood and her doubts see her shunted to the sidelines any further ambiguity about paul having been bred to be a human weapon of mass destruction is snuffed out by the blackandwhite nature of his struggle against the harkonnens theyre even shown in literal monochrome during an epic celebration of arena slaughter and military might complete with ink blot fireworks that introduces feydrautha but while the story could be told in half the time and half the performances fail to register even christopher walken isnt all he could be the images are more than twice as grand the calls to see this on the biggest screen you can are correct the central appeal of this film is the thrill of being overwhelmed by the spectacle and villeneuve delivers time and time again this doesnt quite reach the epic heights of weirdness seen in lynchs version the more physically transformative aspects of spice use remain unseen here but theres more than enough moments of the uncanny and unsettling to break the 40 year stranglehold star wars has had on the visual language of space opera spaceships and alien worlds and bizarre creatures should be stunning and aweinspiring and weird not just beatup and worn out this is a future with an edge to it while theres a spinoff tv series in the works this may or may not be the end of dune on the big screen the smart moneys on a third film being announced once the box office numbers are in this ends on a note that works as an ending and as a beginning the story may not demand a third instalment but this is a franchise built on excess when the fate of the galaxy is at stake too much is never enough anthony morris is a freelance film and television writer hes been a regular

Mar 3 2024,positive, in a desert far far away is dune part two the second installment of the sandy saga of a young warrior named paul wandering the gritty grounds of his futuristic planet in search of the spice of life he encounters old and new foes as he seeks revenge for his fallen family while trying to stave off a holy war if you havent read the dune book series from author frank herbert seen the original 1984 film or even dune part one just a few years ago whats a matter wit you have you had your head in the sand this sprawling blockbuster was green lit for a sequel seconds after part one hit the big screen in 2021 the scifi romantic adventure of warring families is the ten commandments meets star wars timothee chalamet is the moses of arrakis riding sand worms in pursuit of a better life for his chosen people denis villeneuve reprises his roles as writer director and producer of dune and part two is just as big and breathtakingly beautiful to look at as part one its imaximum satisfaction if you are a fan of this story and genre its worth the extra bucks to see dune part two in imax it kept my husband ricky awakethat and a giant pepsi the film clocks in at just under three hours but it moves fastlike the sand in an hourglass  the majority of the part one cast is back along with chalamet including zendaya as love interest and battle babe chani stellan skarsgard josh brolin dave bautista rebecca ferguson and scene stealer and comic relief javier bardem new family foes have been added including christopher walken as the emperor florence pugh as his princess daughter and austin butler as pauls most formidable spice traitor butler gained 25 pounds of muscle and lost all his hair and fortunately his elvis accent for the role of feydrautha  this sequel is more egotistical than its predecessor it has more swagger since its initial success its also more ambitious and complicated technically personally im not a huge science fiction fan so the story like the first is still somewhat hard to follow for me and the dialogue is sometimes unintelligible but dune part two is why we go to the movies read up on the legend beforehand especially if you havent seen part one settle in with some popcorn and marvel at what masterful filmmaking is all about dune part two gets a seven out 10 from me and two ss open from ricky texas radio hall of fame broadcaster tj callahan switched gears from traffic and news reporting as a member of the marconi award winning hudson and harrigan show on kilt in houston to directing you to the right movie theatre as the resident film critic for houston radio platinum and  101 gold  southern new mexicos favorite radio station since 2009 tj has exclusively critiqued premiering films on such stations as krmd in shreveport la kilt in houston wckt in sarasota fla as well as on the chris x blayney show on the liberty eagle radio network and the sam malone show on knth in houston entertaining and informative tj gets right to the point and lets you know whether the latest epic is worth your time listen to her friday and saturdays on houstonradioplatinumcom and on friday afternoons on the leslie t travis show on kvlc fm  in las cruces tj is also a proud member of the critics choice association and the houston film critics society she truly believes everything in life is one degree of blazing saddles

Mar 2 2024,positive, from popcorn buckets sure to be misused in cosmically terrifying ways to what seems like an unprecedented social media blitz dune part two is casting a pop culture shadow the size of an obese sandworm one promo clip forced most of the performers to say the word epic when describing the film as though they had spontaneously conjured up that adjective it was maybe austin butlers best dunerelated acting just kidding hound dog youre worth a dozen chalamets writerdirector denis villeneuve and cowriter jon spaihts fundamentally do not understand what makes the intergalactic desert dramas story compelling to be fair having never read frank herberts source material i dont really either but i do know that people love the shit out of it and it has to be for reasons beyond what weve seen in the story to this point in the cinematic adaptation now more than fiveplus hours in because thus far the only surprising element has been how unintentionally hilarious timothée chalamets line delivery is from ive been having dreams to multiple rage tantrums his outer space messiah feels more like a sentient reddit comment every story beat is explicitly foreshadowed and then happens exactly as described with everyone acting shocked by it to be clear i am the biggest sucker on this planet for space opera shenanigans and a proud giverofanagrade to jupiter ascending with this kind of budget and villeneuves visual flare the worst this could possibly be is a mostly good time dune 2 the dunening is a mostly good time picking up immediately after part one which more sorta stopped than had an actual ending we see paul atreides chalamet acclimating to his new role as the somewhatreluctant jesus christ of the desertdwelling fremen the movies first hour is its best weirdly as watching space paul fall in love with chani zendaya and learn from his replacement daddy stilgar javier bardem feels somehow less gross than most special white boy gets accepted by a native tribe hell later lead movies but dont get fooled space paul is a very special white boy who gets accepted by a native tribe hell later lead he also has dreams see the aforementioned chalamet quote those dreams say that his inevitable clash with the emperor of the universe christopher walken will be costly and bad while space paul and his mom space jessica rebecca ferguson grapple with their intergalactic religious destinies the evil feydrautha butler licks a lot of knives on a planet full of bald people florence pugh spends most of the movie dictating notes into a space tape recorder i dont know man its all joyless and serious the only humor is accidental as space paul keeps collecting complicated names to make up for the fact that his birth name is paul he is also called usul and mauddib and then a few other things that im too tired to google josh brolin comes back out of nowhere there are nuclear weapons so apparently this is also set in the oppenheimer cinematic universe other than visually stunning which it inarguably and unquestionably is the movie series is likely a victim of the books influence that is to say herberts book so greatly affected all science fiction that followed it to the point where it feels redundant and obviousbecause weve spent so much time with stuff that ripped it off and all of that would probably be fine if the lead didnt make me want to gnaw my own arm off every time he spoke he is anticharismatic and watching his tiny little elfin body do combat is so silly i wouldnt believe him as a department store manager leading employees in a battle against black friday shoppers let alone as the savior of the entire galaxy again i somehow still liked this movie i want to stress that but i equally want to stress that we need to stop it with this chalamet business as soon as possible and yet will i be there for dune 3 dune it to me one more time yes note please read this review siddhant adlakha at joysaucecom says these changes while seemingly minor in the grand scheme of things are emblematic of the films overarching narrative point of view one which takes herberts reimagining of an islamic galactic power structure with mostly shia influences and further reimagines it as a patronizing tale of saviorism ian thomas malone at ianthomasmalonecom says pauls weaknesses as a messiah somewhat reflect the reality that our society has moved beyond some of the confines of herberts sandbox villeneuve has crafted a beautiful film that will likely go down as the definitive take on the franchise while also exposing many of the flaws that demonstrate why it took so long to get made in the first place darkskylady at latinamediaco says dune part two is a stunning film to behold but its almost three hours long and its lead cannot shoulder the weight of its thematic ambitions
