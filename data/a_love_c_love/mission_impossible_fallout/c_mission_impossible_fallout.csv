Apr 4 2024,positive, within a jammed pack year of joining this website joining the extra film podcast to getting married to the love of my life to losing one of the closest people ive ever known to becoming the proud father of a beautiful puppy it has been a eventfully game changing year in my life and while all these things were going on the year in film was slowly become one of my favorites the year that was 2018 will go down as the best year of the decade for films with the 2010s  not only was it one of the best years in terms of movies from week to week but the quality of the films and the elevation of genres throughout the year was extraordinary from starting off the year with paddington 2 to ending the year with if beale street could talk im still catching up with films because of the consistent richness that was 2018 this was pound for pound the best year for foreign language films documentaries independent films as well as a very solid year for big blockbuster movies it was also rich in films that shaped or changed the way i thought about the world around with some films making me want to become a better overall person by the closing credits i dont know how 2019 could top 2018 but i will be interesting in seeing how it try to top the best year in film since 2007 we do encourage you to listen to episode 308 to hear more about our picks but as we do every year listed here is my top 20 of 2018   while theyll love me when im dead is a great investigative doc into the life of orson welles wont you be my neighbor is one of the most moving charming important documentaries of the decade the documentary about fred rodgers is more about the man and his philosophy than about the innocent show he was making as stated in the film fred rodgers was a revolutionary and he was completely ahead of his time by the end of the film there is a clip from one of the major news networks taking show at his work blaming this generations laziness on mr rodgers and thats wrong because sufficed to say i wish we had someone like mr rodgers around that was deeply religious and faith based and innocent but also radical and talk about things no one else wants to talk about on tv let alone on a childrens program and by the end of the film all i could do is marvel at the life that was fred rodgers director morgan neville is the new king of documentaries and im fascinated in what subject he will tackle next click here to listen to our full review  this was my first introduction to the main podcast and whod of thought that debra granik long awaited follow up to winters bone would connect with me in such fantastically layered and real way the two lead performances here from thomasin mckenzie and ben foster are so authentic that i felt like they were really father and daughter thus their connection their bond is so real to me it takes the ideas of something like captain fantastic a film i enjoy a couple years ago and expands them into a discussion over the treatment of veterans what a home and a family should be and what personal independence is i wasnt a fan of winters bone but i was a huge fan of this movie and i hope it doesnt take almost another decade to get another film from her about people that we never get to see a lot and the lives that they live click here to listen to our full review  this was the film that took me so long to see this year and from the moment it starts i was hooked i love how chloe zhao makes this film almost feel like a biopicdocumentary within this narrative structure its as real as it could get and feels like something that is personal to everyone that is making it this movie can strikingly beautiful but also being touching as well as you watch brady slowly but surely try to put his life back together it is a film about someone trying to continue their life and live out their dreams but also about coming to an understanding about needing to know when it is time to let things past and move on and find a new passion this is all he knows and all he thinks he has and by the end of the film he realizes that their might be more than that eight seconds it truly a special film and its one that i will regret the most not seeing on the big screen this year click here to listen to our full review  alfonso caurons most personal film of his career is his most visual striking film since children of men the simple story of a maid taking care of a wealthy family in mexico is not only beautiful from what you are seeing but the story feels so real and from the heart that you cant fall in love it it did take a while for it to get going for me but once this movie gets into it mid act twist this movie goes on another level and left me wanting to see it again i wasnt able to see it on the big screen but that didnt stop me from loving thank you netflix for giving cauron a chance at making his vision come true click here to listen to our full review  when i wrote my review for paul schraders bombastic struggle between of mans relationship between religion and climate change i struggled myself in getting out words to describe what the movie was doing to me and i think that was the point this movie challenged me in ways that many films this year did not and leaves you with lasting images that make you question your beliefs and what you are doing to protect this world i said that schrader was making a battle cry with a sermon of a script and he picked the perfect vessel to deliver that sermon in ethan hawke who gives the best performance of his career and of the year click here to listen to our full review  what can i say that many have already said about what i think will go alongside mad max fury road as one of the best action films of the decade from the helicopter chase to the motorcycle chase through paris to the fist fight in the film director christopher mcquarrie takes you on an adrenaline fluid ride with characters we have spent five films with but take the time to give us a story that is built from the bones of the rest of the franchise tom cruise is showing what i believe upon rewatch to give one of the most layered performances of his career and you can really feel when watching this film that this might be the one time ethan cant fully complete the mission and save everyone the film lays down this tension from the get go and never lets go long live the best franchise in hollywood and heres to 2021 and 2022 when we get to accept our next mission click here to listen to our full review  one of the biggest surprises of the year became also one of the most original story of the year in a film that follows the last three days of a young mans probation we are taken on a world of emotions and a look at the city of oakland that is a real as any experience in any other major city this movie is personal and that is because of the script written by the leads of the film in daveed diggs and rafael casal who take their personal struggles and complaints of the city they live in and make them connect within the large world and struggles that many in their communities deal with on a daily basis with biting humor tense cultural relevance and the best use of hip hop ive seen in film in a long time this movie is this generations do the right thing and i cant wait for the next project by these two truly special talents click here to listen to our full review  between the conversation on race the two co lead performances of john david washington and adam driver and the confidence of spike lee as a master filmmaker this film brings us a timely story of the past while connecting it back to our modern times this is a wakeup call as well as a cautionary tale that mixes in pure nostalgia of the past and style of 70s blaxploitation films in a world that seems so divided and angry it took spike lee to bring it all together and make us laugh and cry but also make us think click here to listen to our full review  the love story shown from kiki layne and stephen james is the most romantic realistic relationship i was on screen this year the family dynamics and their values are perfectly portrayed in a script that is a love letter to james baldwin  barry jenkins balances real life issues of accusations of rape as well as mass incarceration as well as it being about innocence and how the color of your skin doesnt matter if someones mind is made up about you and he does it all with a tender loving eye behind the camera jenkins along with nicholas britells score paint a beautiful portrait of these characters and the environment and time they live in if i had more time to digest this movie it might have made my number one but i also think this movie will be like moonlight and only grow in my love for it barry jenkins is the real treasure and is slowly turning into one of the best living filmmakers on the planet click here to listen to our full review  there are so many things i love about this movie the opening the empowerment the political story that is just as interesting as the heist itself widows is a deconstruction of a heist movie taking the genre to new and exciting heights the best ensemble of the year and twist that due to the marketing of the film surprised the hell out of me and then brought this movie to a whole another level its so layered and has a lot going on and while it doesnt work for everyone this movie clicked for me at every single moment by the end of this movie i wanted to see more i wanted to be a part of a chicago world building that hasnt been as good since the dark knight making that city as much of a character as the actors in the film if you didnt see widows please see it i wish more people were talking about this movie because this is a prime example of what we can do when we give visionary directors like steve mcqueen and amazing writers like gillian flynn the resources to make not only just a great genre film that is within their style but a full on masterpiece click here to listen to our full review let us know what you think do you agree or disagree wed like to know why leave a comment in the comment section below or tweet us insessionfilm

Jul 24 2023,positive, synopsis ethan hunt tom cruise and the imf team join forces with cia assassin august walker henry cavill to prevent a disaster of epic proportions arms dealer john lark and a group of terrorists known as the apostles plan to use three plutonium cores for a simultaneous nuclear attack on the vatican jerusalem and mecca saudi arabia when the weapons go missing ethan and his crew find themselves in a desperate race against time to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands finally we reach dday i have been reviewing all films from the mi franchise for the past week and now it is time for the best and craziest movie yet if you want you can check my thoughts on the other films by clicking each ones title mission impossible mission impossible ii mission impossible iii mission impossible ghost protocol mission impossible rogue nation oh my god  these are the three words that kept coming out of my mouth while watching fallout in a world where we barely have any real action anymore since everything is or uses bits of cgi it is a huge breath of relief to be able to enjoy such jawdropping mindblowing outstanding action set pieces i know i have been writing this a lot throughout these reviews but this one completely floored me this is going to be the action movie to beat for a few years  maybe until the next mission impossible installment who knows my heart pumped like it never did before the stuff that tom cruise actually does which is basically everything is unbelievable truly unbelievable like you will have to get home and search for behindthescenes videos to understand how were they able to pull those sequences off he runs like hell jumps from building to building you probably already know about the story of his broken foot performs a halo jump a military parachuting free fall where the parachute is open at low altitude and the drop is performed at 25000 feet insanely drives a motorcycle through paris streets pilots a helicopter  you got it right this is the reason why the mission impossible saga needs to continue if it stops there is never going to exist another film series that can bring such realism and incredible stunts like mi does it is undoubtedly the best action franchise of alltime at least regarding the action set pieces there is no possible comparison with any other movies i am writing this because the ending might bother a few people i have been having some bad luck with endings this year there are a lot of films that i have watched and loved almost everything about it but then its ending disappointed me in some way avengers infinity war a quiet place and some more i hate when directors tease a particular end which would be a shock and something entirely unexpected and at the last minute they back off and take the safe route christopher mcquarrie does that but fallout might be the only movie where i understand why he did it i do not want to go into spoilers territory so i will justify it this way if mcquarrie chose the bold ending fallout would probably be an a but the franchise would have to end as well if it wanted to continue to be successful by choosing the safe route he guarantees the sagas vitality but the film suffers from the issue in the last paragraph since everyone is going to leave the theater thinking oh i wish they would have gone with that ending this is a minor issue that i have apart from another one regarding the first acts pacing this is the longest movie of the saga and mcquarrie already answered why not to this question in particular but he did admit that this film was structured around the action set pieces usually this is a problem because it is often awfully executed never create a movie without writing your story and characters first however this is the sixth film of the franchise and pretty much every significant character has been in the previous installments  nevertheless this justifies why the first act delivers so much information which causes the plot to start a bit convoluted it eventually organizes itself and it becomes a simple story filled with predictable twists and turns that ultimately accomplishes its mission to support the fantastic action sequences please do not expect some oscarworthy screenplays from mi movies because if you leave disappointed due to your unrealistic expectations thats on you as always the cast is sensational and every character that we love and care about come back to one hell of a ride i already blabbed about cruises courage but there are a lot of exceptional performances simon pegg benji and ving rhames luther are a hell of a team providing some needed comic relief moments in such an actionheavy film rebecca ferguson ilsa faust continues to be incredibly captivating michelle monaghan julia has some screentime to shine and alec baldwin alan hunley also brings his agame sean harris solomon lane returns in style and henry cavill walker proves to be a fantastic addition to the saga by being the protagonist of some of the most potent handtohand combat in the series besides the action every technical aspect is seamless the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous there are so many beautiful wide shots and some of them are a true filmmaking achievement the score is remarkable as it usually is in the mi movies and it helps to raise some goosebumps in the vertiginous scenes people with a fear of heights are gonna have a hard time with this one the editing is perfect and the tone and pacing are very wellbalanced with the help of rhames and peggs characters who bring some stops to the extended action sequences the driving around paris sequence could have been shorter there is still that sense of urgency and the frenetic pacing which provides a significant level of entertainment mission impossible  fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of alltime regarding the execution of said action set pieces tom cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history through dozens of runs jumps and god knows what more mcquarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters a simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action and it still carries a few predictable twists only a few nitpicky things forbid me from giving this film an a but i promise you it will definitely be in my top10 by the end of the year go see it on imax now
Jun 22 2023,positive, vague visages mission impossible  fallout review contains minor spoilers christopher mcquarries 2018 movie on paramount features tom cruise henry cavill and ving rhames check out the vv home page for more film reviews along with castcharacter summaries streaming guides and complete soundtrack song listings continuing the narrative of his successful 2015 film mission impossible  rogue nation writer director and now coproducer christopher mcquarrie breaks with imf tradition and commands the directors seat a second time with mission impossible  fallout aka mi6 when it comes to sheer quantity of triplecrosses double agents remote control gizmo toys oneliners stunts and rubber mask fake outs mission impossible  fallout outdoes its predecessors the big question now however is whether the longevity of this franchise is finally taking its toll on the overall quality once again impossible mission force imf agent ethan hunt and his spy fraternity face the impossible task of saving the world from an apocalyptic catastrophe this narrative thread continues to be the bread and butter of the franchise dating back to brad birds mission impossible  ghost protocol 2011 yet even with slight alterations to the standard apocalyptic tale the fallout plot remains largely superficial window dressing consistent with its predecessors it is the castcrew chemistry and stunts that are the true selling points mcquarrie spices things up a bit by bringing back mi5s villain solomon lane sean harris he is a radical anarchist hellbent on taking revenge on hunt and the world striving for maximum suffering to yield epic peace lane is a constant reminder to hunt of his past failures and deepest fears from mi5 to mi6 lanes character shifts from more of a strategist to an anarchist harris acting in mi6 as a doomsday prophet is excellent  yet not as energizing or entertaining as seen in mi5 his portrayal of anarchy is far more subdued and dull than that of heath ledger as the joker in christopher nolans the dark knight 2008 this time a new challenge to the imf is the tight cia leash around hunt and his crew as the top spook august walker henry cavill keeps a careful eye on them with orders to terminate if they go rogue walker presents the main physical threat to hunt individually while lane taunts the imf top agent psychologically both target hunts heart and neither characterization is sufficiently strong the best relationship dynamic is between hunt and mi6 agent ilsa faust rebecca ferguson another carryover from mi5 she continues to add new energy and a coolness factor to this veteran franchise more importantly as a femme fatale archetype faust presents a relationship challenge for hunt restoring to this franchise its cagey team conflicts yet the adrenaline rush of the action sequences is the primary audience pleaser surpassing rogue nation which had midtier heist stunts fallout jumps an even bigger shark with such style and grace that one cannot help but wonder in awe of the absurdity mcquarrie presents on screen cruise effectively turns hunt into a mix of captain america and evil knievel chucking reality straight out the window throughout the stunts mcquarrie and film editor eddie hamilton create a terrific visual narrative flow and cinematographer rob hardys use of both medium and long shots in the imax format is especially impressive pushing the imax format to its limit comparable to nolans the dark knight whether it is paris night cityscape during an intense halo jump or car and boat chases during the day each mi6 frame pops with texture and exquisite attention to detail the best example of the crews talents does not come from the more dangerous moments but rather from the smaller ones mcquarries directorial expertise shines during a tightly storyboarded fight sequence inside a paris nightclub bathroom in this scene the camera is both wide in scope and tightly focused there is a constant sense of dread and with hardly any crosscutting mcquarrie infuses this imminent danger into the audiences view the mi6 editing is lightning fast and crisp the direction and tone of the film is a hybrid of sorts it combines the grittiness of the bathroom fight from true lies 1994 and the cold precision of the restroom scene in jeongbeom lees the man from nowhere 2010 due to a real sense of immersion in this scene one feels the pain the characters are experiencing the audience remains grounded in the heat of the moment and is never playing catch up due to choppy framing or blocking of the shot finally one must consider the tom cruise factor the essence of the film itself cruise once again proves he is an actor sewn from a unique material that is all his own his ability to be both mentally and physically capable of pulling off all his stunts is unparalleled the fact he learned to fly a helicopter for a chase sequence that rivals cinemas best  including bullitt 1968 and the french connection 1971  makes the film worth the price of admission what merits criticism however in the mi6 depiction of hunts scripted wholesomeness we now have a version of this character whose feats of strength and sense of moral justice come off as two dimensional and rather cartoonish hunt is no longer the genuine somewhat flawed guy who first endeared viewers back in 1996 based on the reported influence that cruise has on the franchise films one assumes this specific portrayal of hunt is based on the actors wishes for the character i suspect that mcquarrie is afraid of challenging cruise who gave him big breaks with films like jack reacher 2012 and mission impossible  rogue nation mcquarrie may feel a sense loyalty to cruises vision not his own and based on the way he scripts ilsa faust it is obvious that he can write morally confused characters now imagine what mcquarrie could do with ethan hunt by the end of mi6 the biggest question left isnt about how one can top these stunts but what constitutes the next stage in ethan hunts character arc overall mission impossible  fallout is a good summer flick that wont let you down if youre searching for cinematic entertainment mcquarrie has proven himself to be an excellent director for future installments and probably worthy of taking the helm of dc comics film division at warner brothers jj abrams should stay on as a longterm producer of the mission impossible films because he helped mold the series in a sustainable franchise however its tom cruise who may be the issue cruise must cease playing hunt sooner than later if not now otherwise mission impossible films could turn into a form of spy selfparody outdoing the worst of the final roger moore james bond films when it comes to explaining this to cruise in a polite but matter of fact manner that might prove to be the most impossible mission of them all peter bell petergbell25 is a 2016 master of arts  film studies graduate of columbia university school of arts in

Aug 24 2022,positive, what started as a successful but slightly schizophrenic pet project has evolved into one of my very favorite movie franchises aside from the common thread of their highprofile star the first three mission impossible installments couldnt feel more different it was mainly due to having three very different directors each with their own unique stamp while i enjoyed each of them to varying degrees it was still tough to put a finger on what the series wanted to be that started to change with ghost protocol from director 4 brad bird it put pieces in place and set the table for director 5 christopher mcquarrie and what would be the best mi movie to date rogue nation not only felt connected to its predecessor beyond tom cruises presence but it was incredibly well made and left audiences with a much clearer vision of what the franchise is shooting for fans of rogue nation rejoice christopher mcquarrie breaks the revolving director trend and returns for fallout a movie that ups the ante in terms of breathtaking action yet still tells a thrilling story that well serves its fabulous band of characters mcquarrie has been working towards fallout building its framework for several films now he did uncredited rewrites for ghost protocol cowrote rogue nation and handles the entire script for fallout this is his baby and he knocks it out of the park of course cruise returns along with mainstays ving rhames and simon pegg also back is rebecca ferguson who debuted and stole the show in rogue nation in a prologue 56yearold but far from looking it cruises ethan hunt is informed that three plutonium cores have been stolen by a terrorist group calling themselves the apostles they are an offshoot of the syndicate see rogue nation ran by a mystery man named john lark ethan calls in his imf cohorts the neurotic benji pegg and easygoing luther rhames to help regain the cores but the mission goes awry and the plutonium heads to the black market ethan is able to track the plutonium to paris where a transaction is set to take place near the grand palais before he can head that way freshly christened cia director sloane angela bassett orders him to take along agent walker henry cavill a cia observer and sloanes own personal hammer basically hes sent to make sure the mission succeeds whatever the cost as cavill says in his wriest and driest voice thats the job if you follow the series you know the story cant possible stay in one location in addition to paris we make stops in belfast london even kashmir played by norway along the way we get a whiteknuckled motorcycle chase around the arc de triomphe a foot race across london rooftops which actually resulted in cruise breaking his ankle a mindblowing helicopter duel through the snowcapped mountains of kashmir just to name a few the action sequences are nothing short of exhilarating mostly done through traditional stunt work and practical effects the touches of cgi make a handful of scenes even more breathtaking and whats best is mcquarrie shoots them with visual coherence no indecipherable shaky cams and quick cuts its something to behold but fallout is more that creditstocredits action mcquarrie threads these sequences together with a classicstyle spy story full of twists doublecrosses intersecting plotlines and of course one big nuclear threat in the middle of it all is returning rogue nation baddie solomon lane sean harris an anarchist with a personal axe to grind with the current world order and with ethan hunt his twoheaded mantra the greater the suffering the greater the peace is just as much directed at ethan as to the world system adding another kink is the resurfacing of ilsa faust ferguson once out of the game but now back in and with her own mysterious agenda mcquarrie moves us through his wonderfully knotty plot at a crackling pace tossing us enough twists and turns to ensure there is no downtime for measuring if every piece lines up perfectly but its smart enough to keep us locked in and constantly guessing and cruise remains the heart of the franchise his insane physicality and daredevil willingness to risk life and limb for every shot has never been more evident but its the charactercentric moments that speak volumes hes still a vulnerable hero even a bit naïve and more than any other mi installment fallout centralizes his unshakable moral code as key component of not just this film but the entire series mission impossible continues to be the rare film franchise that actually gets better with age fallout makes no attempt to reinvent the wheel instead it takes the best elements of its predecessors and then cranks the dial past 10 cruise and companys ability to consistently up their game has culminated in this action movie masterclass that earns every ounce of acclaim its getting knowing their history im definitely onboard for more but if the next movies mission should they choose to accept it is to top fallout it could truly prove to be impossible you have me really pumped to see this   i have really liked the last 2 and wondered after the last one how they could surpass that one   one the best movie franchises ever as you know i was pretty excited for this but over the last few days i dialed back my expectations a bit it ended up exceeding them do you know when youll get to see it these pictures have done got old and they do the same thing over and over they always cuss at them meddling kids for pulling their false face off and that tom cruiser lady cant act all she does is show them white teeth and then frown with her serious face i have to say this film is easily the best one in the series  this film along with the last two as you pointed out earlier have finally given mission impossible its identity and it works on multiple levels  while there were some predictable twists the rate at which they kept coming had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film wasnt it great im with you  edge of your seat stuff im hoping mcquarrie sticks around because he has something really special here how was the crowd at your showing im really hoping it does well since i went in the morning there really wasnt much of a crowd  i have no doubt in my mind that fallout is going to make money  ill have to check out box office mojo in a day or so but i think its definitely going to make back its budget by the time monday comes around   im probably going to go see it again  tom cruise is like 57 but to see him do all his own stunts is mindboggling  im hoping he can keep it up for at least two more mission impossible films planning on seeing again too just love this thing i dont give many 5 star scores this is my first this year but this one deserves it so i definitely want to see it again before it leaves the big screen ooooh cindy it is one heck of a ride and hopefully you can see it on the big screen its well worth a trip to the theater i had a big grin on my face in most of this movie but none bigger than when cruise is just booking it through london and mcquarries got the wide shots legendary stuff dare i say dude me too i ate it all up and cruises stunt work is icing on the tensionfilled cake did that even make sense for me its more than a gimmick subconsciously knowing that him out there adds to the intensity for me great review glad you liked it to me while it doesnt beat out the original film or ghost protocol fallout is definitely a great and solid action flick loved it i noticed that too i was surprised afterwards when i realized how long it was it zips by hoping to give it another look this week great review keith funny you should mention the overused quickcutshakycam method of action filmmaking i was watching jj abrams mi iii and whilst its certainly enjoyable thats always my main gripe when rewatching it  it was cooland inventive when bourne did it but its really become nauseous and lazy what i especially appreciate is that although we have a returning director mcquarrie brings a slightly different style and feel to the film in comparison with rogue nation that sort of respects the original mission ahem statement for the franchise of having a new director come in with each new instalment and make it their own thanks so much that jerky cam stuff drives me bonkers especially on a large screen i always think back to the last two taken films and how choppy their action sequences are i always wondered if it was a way to compensate for liam neeson who i love not being the prototypical athletic action hero fallout definitely has a slightly different style i felt it was a touch darker than the last film while still hanging onto its fun sense of humor its a delicate balance and mcquarrie handles it really well havent seen this yet but im eager to now they keep hitting this one out of the ballpark a series that has got stronger and is now making its best entries in the franchise oh man this is a must watch on the big screen definitely see it before it leaves the theater im still amazed at how they up the ante without dumbing down their movies love it loving the review spot on i think fallout is the best mi movie so far im not the biggest fan of tom cruise on a personal level but what he does as an actor is incredible i think im with you i love the franchise especially rogue nation thank you rebecca fergusson but i do think this tops them all did you happen to see it in imax i hoping to before it leaves my area most of the mi movies are fine stand alone films this one is a little different you would still be fine watching it on its own but there are several things directly connected to the last movie im amazed at how they manage to consistently bring the quality with the mi movies how have they not jumped the shark yet it must be the same magic tom cruise uses to keep himself from aging its pretty amazing and not only bring the quality but make the movies steadily better im really impressed and cant wait to finally see it again
May 19 2022,positive,even in their sixth installment the mission impossible films remain a breath of fresh air amidst the cgifueled superhero spectacles of the summer
Mar 11 2022,positive, tom cruise is the cinemas greatest action star fortunately such a hyperbolic claim is not without an argument to back it up around the dawn of the last century douglas fairbanks swashbuckled his way to fame by climbing walls riding horses and swinging from ropes in titles like the mark of zorro 1920 or robin hood 1922 although fairbanks was an accomplished gymnast he eventually conceded to use stunt doubles for the most daring feats after fairbanks errol flynn took the crown having shot his own arrows and performed dangerous sword fights in the adventures of robin hood 1938 and the sea hawk 1940 in the subsequent decades actors including tyrone power bruce lee harrison ford sylvester stallone arnold schwarzenegger and others became action icons but few could actually perform the exploits of their characters and instead relied on the talents of stunt workers perhaps because their skills are evident onscreen martial artists have dominated cinematic bravado in recent decades allowing for jackie chan and jason statham to impress with their ability to carry out elaborately choreographed fights but how many of these actors from fairbanks to chan have tied themselves to the side of a plane how many have driven at top speeds in fastpaced motorcycle races hung from a helicopter in midair climbed mountains without a net outran an exploding aquarium or held his breath underwater for several minutes how many have dangled on the tallest building in the world only cruise has subjected himself to such exploits and more for the sake of screen action and the abovelisted examples remain restricted to the mission impossible franchise still going strong since its dazzling brian de palma debut in 1996 the sixth entry mission impossible  fallout contains some seriesbest spectacles among them a memorable car chase to rival the one in the french connection 1971 brutal handtohand combat and a breathless helicopter chasefor which cruise learned to fly helicopters and then piloted his own craft in the film director christopher mcquarrie who captained the previous entry rogue nation sells every incredible setpiece not just because he realizes the proceedings in such a clearly presented way complete with an effortless shotbyshot logic and visual cohesion but because cruise sells the most unbelievable moments in the film by actually performing them theres very little reliance on cgi allowing subconsciously the viewer to recognize somewhere in the back of our minds that what were seeing onscreen is realas opposed to the usual hollywood confection cruise and mcquarrie engross the viewer by making the most outlandish stunts look and feel like they really happened more than the first two titles in the mission impossible franchise the last few have maintained a relatively steady character base and plot after jj abrams reinvigorated the material in 2006 but fallout follows closely the events and characters from rogue nation and even maintains the same villain and supporting players imf point man ethan hunt backed by his behindthescenes tech support luther ving rhames and his other techieturnedfieldman benji simon pegg operates under the close watch of their new department head secretary alan hunley alec baldwin hunts team has been tasked with taking down the apostles a terrorist faction devoted to the notion that the greater the suffering the greater the peacehence their resolution to cause as much suffering across the globe as possible the apostles follow in the footsteps of their former leader solomon lane sean harris who was imprisoned by hunt and co at the end of the last film one of lanes devotees named john lark presumably a double agent in us intelligence hopes to acquire three plutonium cores in an effort to create three nuclear weapons hunts team accepts the impossible mission to identify lark recover the cores and stop lanes apostles once and for all at the same time the cias director erica sloan angela bassett demands one of her agents the towering brute august walker henry cavill oversee hunts progress she calls walker the hammer to hunts scalpel and more than once walkers unsubtle approach smashes the imfs carefully laid plans returning to the mix is ilsa rebecca ferguson a former mi6 agent who walked away from her life of undercover spying in lanes syndicate which is to say its helpful if fallouts audience remembers the events in rogue nation even mission impossible iii to appreciate in full the emotional significance of the events here to be sure hunts estranged wife played by michelle monaghan makes several appearances in the film lending to hunts characterization as a man driven by a terrifying fear that should lane and his cohorts succeed hell be unable to save the people who matter most to him for sloan hunts willingness to sacrifice the success of an entire mission in which millions of lives hang in the balance in exchange for a single life means the agent has been compromised the script written by mcquarrie rewards those who pay close attention to the plot machinations and twists throughout without dwelling on moments or dumbing them down for an inattentive audience about midfilm an unassuming sequence that takes place in a series of underground tunnels contains about three twists and doublecrosses in a matter of minutes each more effective and unpredictable than the last and mcquarrie allows them to unfold thoughtfully trusting his audience to keep up not that it requires much to follow the story as mcquarrie efficiently sketches out the stakes early in the films breezesby twoandahalfhour runtime the structure modeled after the hitchcockian ideal of grabbing the viewer from the first sequence and not letting go never allows the viewer a moment of ease alfred hitchcock has long been an influence on the franchise from the elegantly conceived set pieces to the wrongmanthriller elements to the way each film forces the viewer to hold their breath until the last possible moment throughout the remainder the audience follows along either invested in the weighty dramatic arcs for characters like hunt ilsa and benji or attuned to the remarkable action most viewers will walk away from fallout exhilarated talking about cruises stunts or the downright exhausting chases by motorcycle automobile helicopter and foot but the story rewards those invested in the characters and while mcquarries script contains less humor or moments of levity than the previous two sequels the lofty threat of nuclear genocide and personal loss intensifies the stakes more than previous missions mcquarrie began his string of collaborations with tom cruise as the screenwriter of valkyrie 2008 he later directed the actor on jack reacher 2012 and also contributed to the deft scripting on edge of tomorrow 2014 even with mcquarries accomplished filmmaking on rogue nation his work on fallout is a leap in craft and skill hes elevated himself from a screenwriterturneddirector to an extraordinarily accomplished visualist with a fully realized aesthetic shot by rob hardy annihilation theres a soft nolanesque sheen to the proceedings recalling the look of inception or the dark knight hardys rather straightforward plainly presented lensing of the action along with eddie hamiltons editing capture the daring and deathdefying stunts in all their considerable glory the production seems engineered to make the most of cruises devotion to action realism particularly in the last 20 minutes when hunt inches up a payload rope attached to the bottom of a helicopter guides himself inside to the front of the craft and then takes over above the mountains of kashmir indiaa stunt marked by its balance of suspense amid beautiful scenery whats more cruise performs some extraordinary motorcycle work becomes the first actor to perform a highaltitude skydive and runs in a wowing extended pursuit he has long been hollywoods best runner any of these sequences is incomparable and yet fallout is filled with them then again mcquarrie and the 56yearold cruise are unafraid to acknowledge that the star may be dimming opposite the broadshouldered cavill todays superman who towers over cruise hunt isnt the invincible hero he once was in fallout hes out of his depth more than once which of course makes the film all the more thrilling over the course of six films the mission impossible franchise has remained mostly consistent with the exception of the abominable second film by director john woo deepening its hold on viewers with each new entry with fallout mcquarrie delivers not only the best film in the franchise after de palmas slick original but one of the great films of artfully photographed and technically monumental actionto be included on a list alongside other titles of similarly grand scope and design the road warrior 1982 aliens 1986 die hard 1988 heat 1997 skyfall 2012 and mad max fury road 2015 above all fallout reminds us that neither cruises talent nor the enduring quality of his mission impossible films should be taken for granted each new sequel attempts something new something weve never seen before and does this with a sense of spythriller panache that no other action franchise has matched with such unbridled showmanship and consistent keepsyouguessing story audiences will be watching mcquarries direction and cruises stuntwork for years to come reflecting with a sense of awe over how they accomplished what they did and how rare it is that the filmmakers took the risk to achieve it
Feb 12 2022,positive, tom cruise is back as imf agent ethan hunt in mission impossible  fallout this is the sixth installment of the mission impossible franchise and i have to say that the series just keeps getting better at this point besides the bond films it has a good shot at becoming one of the greatest franchises in cinema history along with james bond of course it beats the fast and furious franchise by a long shot thats for sure the last film mission impossible  rogue nation was probably the best installment to date with a very slight lead over mission impossible  ghost protocol mission impossible  fallout stars tom cruise as ethan hunt henry cavill as august walker simon pegg as benji dunn rebecca ferguson as ilsa faust ving rhames as luther stickell sean harris as solomon lane angela basset as erica sloan vanessa kirby as white widow michelle monaghan as julia meadehunt alec baldwin as alan hunley wes bentley as patrick and frederick schmidt as zola the marketing team was having a field day promoting real stunts with mission impossible  fallout and for good reason one of the main draws of this film is that in a world of cgi seeing cruise  perform these insane stunts for the sake of the film is inspiring and freaking intense as a moviegoer watching them play out onebyone in fallout made me anxious because i knew that they were mostly real thats what a summer blockbuster should be in a world full of cgi be a mission impossible i hope the rock is taking notes the film is directed and written by christopher mcquarrie who penned the last film as well hes the first director to stay on for multiple films and im not complaining in preparation for mission impossible  fallout i watched all five movies backtoback what struck me from the getgo is how disconnected the first second and third feel from each other luckily the franchise didnt stop at a trilogy or it wouldve done a great disservice when you go from the third fourth and fifth installment theres much more continuity fleshing out of characters and getting to what ethan hunt is all about unlike a bond or john wick hunt is the only of these characters who is morally grounded for better or worse he cares deeply enough about his team to sabotage a mission if one of them is in danger its a fault but its one that is honorable in a character and sets hunt apart one of the things that fallout does well  and i cant sing the praises high enough  is showing the wear and tear the spy game has had on hunt not all of his plans work out in this one cavills character walker is there to point out how ridiculous some of hunts plans sound including the infamous masks  a nod to the crazy antics the series has pulled off i liked that we saw some flaws and saw hunt in situations that werent always going to go his way this is where a character like hunt can shine and seems like a callback to the action heroes of yesteryear aka 90s its when they are down and out that they do their best work think bruce willis in the die hard franchise another highlight of fallout is that it clears up the whole romantic trio that started emerging in rogue nation with the faust character mirroring hunt we never really saw julia in the last installment only at the end of the fourth film ghost protocol i didnt mind the missing mention because as a viewer you can assume shit happened one is not exactly going to have a happilyeverafter in spy world also i dont like a lot of romance in my spy thrillers or action films if its not called for i dont need to have a damsel in distress to get me to root for the hero however in hunts case this love triangle is heartbreaking and satisfying it was really touching to have rhamess character luther who has been the only character to last the whole series deliver the heartfelt speech to faust about hunt and his two lady loves clearly faust and hunt have something brewing even though no kisses have been exchanged i mean shes basically the female version of hunt and dare i say slightly better having saved his butt a few times i dont know how they wouldnt fall in love given these scenarios i have to mention vanessa kirby as white widow because i am huge fan of hers from her portrayal of princess margaret in netflixs the crown she was the perfect white widow and held her own against the seasoned cruise bravo okay lets get to the stunts theres skydiving into a lightning storm motorcycling through the streets of paris and a helicopter chase among others plus an amazing heartpumping score to accompany all the action theres one scene early on in the film that is probably one of the best action sequences ive seen in a long time kudos to cruise cavill and liang lang as lark decoy you can see a snippet of that scene in the trailer with cavills infamous arm pumps honestly as an action fiend longing for the days of real stunts i was in heaven watching mission impossible  fallout it was the right amount of practical with the slightly oh come on experience which is what i want in a movie cruise is better than ever and however you feel about him as a person one thing you cant deny is that he brings the hollywood blockbuster agame and were all the better for it with all good things there are some tiny flaws i have to point out henry cavill bless his superman heart look i love cavill ever since he was the sidekick to a former mission impossible alum jonathan rhys meyers in the tudors but i have to say it his delivery of the lines are at times comical and cringy i dont know what it is but he needs to work on it there were also some weird transitions from luthers speech that felt out of place among other moments but those are forgivable all in all mission impossible  fallout is bringing action back and i cant get enough make sure you head out and catch this movie on the big screen  catherine grew up watching action flicks at a very young age which led to her love of film she graduated from the university of texas at austin with a bachelors in radiotvfilm in 2012 always the adventurer catherine traveled and lived in sydney australia for a year where she took a selfie with brad pitt she runs shuffle with passion lots of caffeine and tacos when shes not editing or writing you can find her crafting and planning her next adventure

Aug 21 2021,positive, from the moment the fuse lights for the opening credits there isnt a single second for you to catch your breath in mission impossible  fallout this is the best most relentless most wellexecuted action movie since mad max fury road tom cruise jumps out of a plane hangs from a rope attached to a helicopter and leaps across london rooftops all at age 56 and this is just a fraction of the jawdropping action scenes sprinkled throughout this twoandahalfhour thrill ride cruise returns as ethan hunt alongside benji simon pegg and luther ving rhames theyve lost a case of stolen plutonium which is now in the hands of the apostles the remnants of the syndicate from rogue nation so the cia adds walker henry cavill to keep tabs on hunt and make sure he doesnt lose any more assets but as walker asks in one pivotal scene how many times has hunts government betrayed him how long until someone like that has had enough its a fair question as moles and traitors have threatened his life and killed his team members in past movies but thats nothing compared to the double and triple crosses in store in fallout much of the film takes place in paris and that chunk of the film is among the best 30 to 40minute stretches of any film ever including a oneshot halo jump the bathroom fight that features cavill pumping his fists like hes reloading a gun a nightclub brawl a car chaseheist thats extremely reminiscent of the dark knight and a subsequent motorcycle chase that tops rogue nation and mi2 i literally gasped on more than one occasion and this isnt even to women the terrific women of the cast none of whom are leered at or used as pawns three in ethans orbit rebecca ferguson vanessa kirby and angela bassett do a great job of keeping their intentions murky so were never sure whos side theyre on exactly theres also a major reunion in the third act that cruise plays with the right mix of happiness giving way to horror theres a lot of personal stakes in this film which make it matter a lot more than the typical endoftheworld stuff which is also present the inevitable bomb diffusion feels a little weightier because of the people ethan feels like hes letting down which could play as callous in the wrong hands but christopher mcquarrie had already delivered some solid action movies now hes made a certifiable masterpiece
Jun 24 2021,positive, i have something to confess i have never seen a single mission impossible movie in my life i had no idea what i was in for when i entered the theater to see the newest installment of the spy franchise apparently ive been missing out on a lot what begins as a standard action flick very quickly turns into something else entirely something unlike anything i have ever seen before the second the film reaches an early scene where the indestructible ethan hunt the indestructible tom cruise is about to jump out of a plane roughly five miles up in the sky and you realize that what youre about to see is real with no green screen and no stunt double you know youre in for something special what is mission impossible  fallout about they try to keep it simple some bad guys have gotten their hands on plutonium and are going to make some nukes its up to ethan hunt and his elite team ving rhames and simon pegg to stop them and get that plutonium back along the way they have to contend with the cia and their operative august walker henry cavill and mi6 agent ilsa faust rebecca ferguson who are going after the plutonium as well its paperthin and none of the characters seem to have much of a personality although that could be attributed to me not seeing any of the previous films but in this particular case none of that seems to matter  the story and its characters are all just background noise in fallout this movies focus is completely on the enormous action set pieces and the outrageous stunts shown in them there are many of them and they are jawdropping in their presentation you cant help but be impressed and blown away by the sheer amount of work put into this thing fallout had three thousand setups thirteen helicopters four weeks of aerial photography and shooting took place on three different continents tom cruise an insane human being in every possible way trained for an entire year to be prepared for the halo high altitude low opening jump stunt a sequence that gets your heart practically beating out of your chest and makes your eyes unable to look away from what youre witnessing onscreen  this is the movie that broke cruises ankle while he was performing a stunt where he leaps from building to building and wouldnt you know it thats the take they use in the movie itself you can see him limp away from his hard fall and continue running theres a whiteknuckle highspeed helmetfree motorcycle chase through the streets of paris which includes a portion in which cruise speeds against traffic in the circle around the arc de triomphe the finale includes a helicopter chase through snowy mountains in which cruise does most of the piloting himself all of these are done mostly without green screens and cg if there are any theyre not at all noticeable and the way that all of it is done practically is truly something to behold in all of its glory preferably on an  imax screen in a perfect world this is the film that finally gets the oscars to add a category for stunts  lorne balfes the florida project the lego batman movie score is incredible its loud boisterous full of life and energy and a brilliant reminder of what makes a movies soundtrack so much fun the film makes expert use of it blaring it during certain action scenes so that all other noise is basically muted or having no score at all letting the insane stunts youre watching speak for themselves cinematographer rob hardy annihilation ex machina never pulls the camera away its with the action every step of the way supplying plenty of long continuous takes coupled with faraway wide shots that work to show you the true scope of these insane stunts like tom cruise dangling on a rope attached to a helicopter something else he actually did in real life make no mistake this film is an adrenaline rush youll feel like you chugged down several red bulls after leaving the theater your heart will be racing and youll have to fight the urge to speed out of the parking lot like a madman  there arent any correct words i can use to describe exactly what the experience of seeing this film is in a theater its something you have to go through yourself dont worry about the plot because none of it seems to matter anyway its all an excuse to move along from one action set piece to the next but you wont mind i certainly didnt hollywood has been churning out giant blockbusters for years now where every action scene is a cgfilled party so it is astounding to see a movie like this where nearly everything that youre seeing is real and tangible its what makes it feel like such a genuine thrill ride its the perfect summer action movie its edgeofyourseat excitement and you need to make like tom cruise and run and run and run some more

Feb 28 2021,positive, writing a review for mission impossible  fallout gave my thesaurus a workout the film the sixth instalment in the tom cruise franchise is jammed to the gills with nextlevel stunts that require an expanded vocabulary to describe words like extreme or exciting or even epic and those are only the e words dont come close to describing the behemothic action sequences contained within cruise returns as the seemingly invincible action man and imf impossible mission force agent ethan hunt hunt and his crew tech wiz benji simon pegg and agent luther ving rhames are charged with finding and capturing anarchist solomon lane sean harris a baddie who was the leader of the syndicate during the last film rogue nation whatever you heard about lane explains hunt if it makes your skin crawl its probably true lane is working with the mysterious and murderous john lark a man with some extreme ideas about squashing the world order as lark and lane collect the necessary plutonium to fulfil their plan the cia begins to have doubts about hunts loyalty add to that the return of former mi6 agent ilsa faust rebecca ferguson and some newbies cia assassin august walker henry cavill and black market arms dealer and lady of mystery white widow vanessa kirby and you have lots of characters to fill the space between the stunts complicating matters is the fallout from some of hunts previous wellintentioned missions there are a lot of very goodlooking people in mission impossible  fallout handsome fellas and femme fatales they are all woven into a stylish story of international intrigue and plutonium like the others mi movies its packed with exotic locationsonly james bond has more air travel points than ethan huntdoublespeak and double crosses but the narrative doesnt matter that much its all in service of the bunyanesque action choreographed to an inch of hunts lifecruise really puts himself out there for this onethe realism of the stunts gives the movie a sense of danger and the green screen department the day off monumental vertigo inducing single sequences take place on land wheels water and air only the screeching of tires score one eyepeeling chase scene between a motorcycle and a car visually it is so visceral director christopher mcquarrie wisely avoided cluttering the scene with frenetic music it doesnt need it of course those looking for a finely crafted john le carré style story of espionage in mission impossible  fallout will be bitterly disappointed while it does contain huggerymuggery it frequently falls just this side of making sense thats not to say it isnt entertaining even when hunt isnt in action the movie is in perpetual motion but frederick forsyth this aint instead it is an elephantine although no actual elephants appear action epic that breaks the blockbuster norm of cutting away to an action sequence every ten minutes or so its made up of three brobdingnagian set pieces stitched together by words that mostly make sense richard crouse shares a toast with celebrity guests and entertainment pundits every week on ctvs exciting talk show pop lifesaturdays at 830 on ctv newschannel midnight on ctv
Jan 29 2021,positive, they just dont make them like this anymore in the age of superheroes and largescale scifi epics mission impossible  fallout is a refreshing throwback to ballstothewall stuntwork that manages to thrill and amaze just as adeptly as its shinier cgi brethren the first true sequel in a sixfilm franchise tom cruises iron will to entertain with insane physical setpieces along with christopher mcquarries sharp script and direction mark this mission as one of the best mild spoilers ahead mission impossible  fallout the latest entry in the tom cruisestarring spy franchise is ironically also the most analog of the series a dangerous nighttime halo jump a frantic chase through the streets of paris a sweeping helicopter dogfight through the icy mountains of kashmir  these are just some of the breathtaking setpieces that take place during the film and for the most part performed for real by cruise and company fallout is a relentless thrill ride that thrives on practical stuntwork with its charms conveyed not through a cgi editing bay but through the notion that tom cruise will jump out of an airplane over a hundred times to capture that perfect shot even within its own franchise fallout explodes forth with its refreshing and reliquary charms gone are the cgi security camera shenanigans and exploding kremlins of ghost protocol and gone are the complex underwater heists of director christopher mcquarries previous mission impossible  rogue nation this latest installment the first direct sequel of the series instead focuses on visceral thrills sans any bells and whistles and it works like gangbusters taking place two years after the excellent rogue nation mission impossible  fallout sends ethan hunt tom cruise hurtling on another worldsaving adventure after a botched attempt to recover stolen plutonium the bad guys this time around are the apostles splintered remnants of the syndicate still loyal to anarchist solomon lane sean harris after he was put away at the end of rogue nation when hunt is forced to bust lane out of interpol custody in order to retrieve the plutonium spheres a race against the clock to avert nuclear catastrophe begins complicating matters is the addition of august walker henry cavill flexing his physicality even more than he did as superman a cia assassin tasked with keeping hunt and his imf compatriots on a short leash rebecca ferguson by far the best part of rogue nation makes a welcome return as ilsa faust an mi6 agent with her own mysterious agenda her role as friend as well as foil hasnt changed much from the previous film but fergusons wildcard portrayal is so charming that one finds it hard to complain mission impossible  fallout is a twisty film full of swerves and betrayals but not exactly undpredictable  big reveals are heavily telegraphed and the films primary twist is almost disappointingly rote  but where fallout succeeds is in the execution of the plot the film dips heavily into the trope jar when it comes to its surprises but there is always a refreshing and exciting spin that will put a big grin on your face even if you do see the end result coming a mile away it also helps that fallouts momentum is nothing short of explosive  the films 147 minute runtime feels like a blink of the eye when youre watching tom cruise barrel through setpiece after setpiece seemingly with zero regard for his own safety mission impossible  fallout will stimulate the dormant sections of your adrenaline centers a kind of thrill long missing from action cinema that exploding cgi spaceships and massive destruction cant even begin to mimic  mission impossible  fallout  is the most fun youll have at the movies this summer with a brand of action and spectacle that hollywood just doesnt produce anymore at 56 years young theres no sign of tom cruise slowing down in his quest to entertain his mission with this franchise which he always chooses to accept is to work as hard as he can to deliver overthetop stunts and outdo his last effort and fallout is the best one yet one can only imagine what the next installment will bring 
Dec 7 2020,positive, fter megalomaniacal terrorist solomon lane sean harris was apprehended several years ago by the imf a new threat has emerged in his place in their leaders absence his underlings have formed the apostles a mysterious group of mercenaries hellbent on continuing in their madman commanders footsteps when renounced scientist nils delbruuks kristoffer joner designs for a complex set of nuclear bombs are uncovered the imf team including ethan hunt tom cruise luther stickell ving rhames and benji dunn simon pegg must intercept the three plutonium spheres intended for the weapons before they fall into the wrong hands when the mission sours the cia assigns arrogant agent august walker henry cavill to accompany the imf on their next task of locating the missing radioactive metal as the group tracks their prize to cunning arms dealer white widow vanessa kirby and elusive assassin john lark they engage in a treacherous chase across the globe where a second failure would mean the deaths of millions since the series is already six feature films deep its not surprising that this latest entry begins with a number of references to the previous chapters without much explanation for anyone not caught up clearly the filmmakers arent too concerned with gaining fresh fans instead theyre hoping to keep the existing enthusiasts who cant get enough of impossible missions accomplished always in the nick of time just as the world is about to succumb to a nuclear holocaust  or within a split second as a bullet is diverted a knife thrust is blocked or a parachute needs to open to avoid splattering the heroes across landmarks to the films credit even with all of the repetition it definitely lives up to its name the extremist splinter cell that has been causing troubles for hunt and his team sounds a lot like james bonds spectre but the last few mission impossible entries have managed to avoid the utter dreariness that has been consuming 007 of late here theres a sensational blend of humor and action refraining from dismal severity yet staying well out of the range of campy hunt probably needs to be willing to kill his enemies more often but his reluctance enables him to be a clearcut hero which is refreshing amidst the more common antiheroes that pervade cinemas and though several of the early ruses arent terribly clever particularly as the 3dprinted faces that everyone dons hints at the likelihood of switches the plot doesnt go overboard with the mugswapping even though the dialogue makes the grave error of pointing out the signature silliness of this franchise the imf is halloween a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat huffs the cia chief erica sloan angela bassett believable tech makes an appearance as well aiming to offset the scifi components highlighted by altitude gear tracking devices and computer readouts the cloakanddagger elements also escalate allowing the story to rely on spy games just as much as the action despite ethans successes always depending on plenty of luck hope is not a strategy infiltrations ambushes extractions surveilling tailing assassins globetrotting and shootouts make their standard appearances too rounding out  and perhaps needlessly prolonging  the adventure one of the films greatest strengths however is that sense of adventure especially when the stuntwork ensures that tom cruises features are very much visible for the majority of the shots his notable dedication to performing his own stunts is admirable as well as convincing though most audiences will probably fail to realize just how much effort and pain went into the final product martial arts fights are tense while heists are nicely chaotic one sequence artistically removes all sounds and sound effects for a welcome change of pace and the protracted chase scenes are mesmerizing the bulk of the second act is little more than a chase that segues into another chase that segues into yet another chase frequently changing speeds locations and even modes of transportation but its the finale that really steals the show making the best of editing and cuts to distract viewers from the fact that virtually every one of the imfs tasks boils down to the diffusing of a bomb and the music is once again outstanding bolstering every sequence with the right amount of verve designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent

Aug 26 2020,positive, in an age of james bond and jason bourne the spy genre has become a constant reevaluation of its modernity  both franchises have found a level of adaptability in understanding how the world mirrors the reality of its protagonists  not to be left behind mission impossible has earned its right to be amongst the conversation  far removed from its 60s past of peter graves barbara bain and martin landau the franchise in its current format has culturally redefined its contextual history to this generation of filmgoers  each film has been a new and enduring lease of life embodying a stunt spectacle as well as a contemporary spy movie of its era with tom cruise as its committed leader mission impossible  fallout represents the very best of the franchise if there was a chance for the oscars to update its proceedings then a best stunt category is long overdue and necessary one of the many successes from the mission impossible franchise is its ability to challenge  in many respects it has become the fast and the furious of the spy genre always finding bigger and better ways to outdo its previous film whilst retaining a seminal connected universe  by proxy it creates a fantastical familiarity but also a trope in itself where audiences can mindlessly escape without thinking too much of its relevance  that characteristic has evolved as both franchises have grown up to become the behemoths that they are today fast five changed its concept from street racing to a heist movie with cars  while the stunt edge has always been present throughout its safe to say that ghost protocol set mission impossible on its current trend of exhilaration but fallout is a different specimen both tonally and as a retrospective piece a gamechanger as some would argue  director christopher mcquarrie doesnt rely on the laurels of the previous accomplishments of the franchise but decides to reevaluate its purpose  what does mission impossible and the imf mean in the global terms of terrorism political powers and the agencies designed to protect us  rogue nation gave us glimpses of that ideology putting the imf on trial so to speak with its confrontations between william brandt jeremy renner and alan hunley alex baldwin  but fallout undertakes a personalised endeavour as a bondesque adventure more skyfall than spectre by forcing it to look at how it started and evolved  fallout might be a direct sequel to rogue nation but its lineage ties back to brian de palmas 1996 classic as a serious and measured spy film mcquarries imprint is an effective homage not just to the franchise with its reminiscing stunt sequences but to the genre  mcquarrie returns us to the world of what spying entails so synonymous by trademark which weve seen in tinker tailor soldier spy the spy who came in from the cold atomic blonde and even james bond under connery in from russia with love its a return of the cold war ethics of double agents and crossings clandestine meetings shadowy conspiracies infiltration and trades  the fact that its first key scene takes place in berlin the historical hotspot of cold war spies is a notable nod to its credibility  the only thing missing would have been to film in black and white capturing the undertones of film noir its within this context that fallout starts to reevaluate the world and find some grounded perspective taking a note out of nolans playbook and what he achieved with the dark knight the dark knight was a mirrored reflection and allegory of a post 911 world and the efforts on the war on terror where fear was a stepping stone towards a fractious unpredictable and destabilising chaos that exposed the moral foundations and rules weve built our lives upon  the joker heath ledger was unable to fulfil his ultimate plan of witnessing gothams submission to that chaos thanks to batman christian bale rescuing the soul of the city however his ability to turn a prominent figure a hero in harvey dent aaron eckhart towards the dark side is one of those haunting and psychological traits about the corruption of the human spirit a similar essence is explored in fallout  solomon lane sean harris might as well be the joker of the mi franchise someone who lives up to alfred pennyworths line about some men just want to watch the world burn  lanes antiinstitutional stance and zealot belief in resetting the world is as symbolically influential as ras al ghul and the league of shadows but represented as an upscaled version of the syndicate called the apostles  lanes personal fascination with ethan hunt tom cruise not only makes him a significant villain since the days of philip seymour hoffman back in mi3 but challenges the obsessive foundations of what hunt stands for as a corruptible force to hunts moral compass  therefore ethan hunt may share some batman like qualities but he might as well be the harvey dent in this equation  they both share an almost gungho attitude in stepping in front of danger and considering that once again hunt has to prove his allegiance lives up to dents you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain  its a loyalty that audiences may never have questioned due to hunts unprecedented heroics but with each impossible mission particularly in fallouts case almost entertains the idea of a dark side we witness that in a staged hospital scene of that supposed darkness and abject failure where the plutonium he needed to rescue out from the hands of the terrorists is used to bomb three global locations  the darkness reappears in hunts vision of the heist where he contemplates the possibility of killing innocent people to follow through with the exchange  even hunts dreams have become a guiltridden infection due to lanes radicalised influence  but coded within its dark chaotic articulation and lorne balfes superb zimmeresque score mcquarrie presents a paralleled understanding in the terrific paris chase sequence  the mirrored sense of anticipation and impending doom is a role reversal where instead of harvey being used as bait to lure the joker out ethan is preventing the joker from ending up in the wrong hands what makes the motivations relatable as it is is how mcquarrie uses fallout to establish that ethan hunt has become the impossible mission  as hunt dives head first into the unknown he creates consequences knowing each decision can have longterm damages does all of hunts risktaking actually surmount to anything when it removes one obstacle but creates a vacuum in its place  what is it good for if the extent of that reach can recruit new followers at an astronomical rate  how deep does that infection go when supposed allies and colleagues turn out to be double agents  fallout almost analyses hunt as an internalised perspective of his character in the context of the entire franchise and his valued contribution to the world  the mission itself is more of a personal expression than the physical exertions its very obvious to suggest that mission impossible  fallout is just more of the same from the franchise  but the key distinction is that fallout attempts to humanise the concept this is not just in connection to ethan hunt who will always remain the focal point but with characters who have been with us since mi3  in its attempt to give a conclusion these familiar characters help reinforce the danger and the sacrifices made when spectre clumsily attempted to build a cinematic universe at the last minute by shoehorning all of craigs bond villains as part of the same organisation the characters of benji simon pegg luther ving rhames and ilsa rebecca ferguson solidify ethans world to allow a missiondriven universe to form naturally  ethan has a win at all costs mentality in saving the world but his friends have become a cornerstone of his humanity so that the work he does is not always in vain as a vehicle wellversed in cinema language its how fallout utilises tension and suspense to a hitchcockian level  like with psycho and its famous shower scene fallout is almost too claustrophobic opting for an intense up close and personal feel that puts its audience right into the centre of that action  that deus ex machina that most films love to do by pulling a rabbit out of a hat whenever there is a tight situation would have felt like a cheat move under fallout and yet is never within close reach when you want that comforting safety similar to the efforts pulled with rogue nation and the brilliant opera scene each stunt in fallout is like a chain reaction of chaos that seems to escalate and evolve when you least expect it  its no surprise that mcquarrie was directly influenced by the silent movie era of chaplin lloyd and keaton because fallout is very much a visual art piece of cause and effect  films like mad max fury road and john wick chapter 2 have used action to that extent where if you turn the sound down the stunts tell its own synchronised story  the rising escalation and its upgraded complexity operate like a cinematic dance that works towards its final crescendo and leaves you breathless what fallout celebrates is the art of the stunt work at its most visceral best because the more reckless the stunt the more you believe it  what fallout brings to the table is an action authenticity where you feel every brutal punch and every thrilling chase knowing youve gone through an experience  despite hunt appearing to have dabbed into the dark arts for an invincibility spell you steadily sense his vulnerability and desperation pushed further into the insanity of the stunt if anything mission impossible has become a living testament and commitment in its constant search for new stylish ways to integrate stunt and story  fallout represents the best accumulation of that  like the ethos of silent cinema and its incredible stunts the relentless action is constantly pulling you and its characters out of their comfort zone another mission impossible film is all but guaranteed  as one chapter closes fallout opens the door for more possibilities  no matter how it continues tom cruise and his chase for stunt excellence will be a driving force for the continued brilliance of this franchise
Aug 14 2020,positive, ethan hunt must deal with a returning terrorist villain a new group of zealots and an interfering cia operative in his latest very improbable mission being a film critic is the best job in the world  obviously sometimes though its easy to lose sight of that sitting through the latest noisy installment in the transformers franchise or enduring a comedy thats about as funny as a brexit white paper is enough to make even the most devoted cinephile question their career decisions thank goodness then for movies like mission impossible  fallout its a stupid ridiculous shlocky romp so enjoyable that it restores every lost iota of faith in cinema to amaze enthral and excite not bad for the sixth film in a fairly generic collection of action movies for the first time in the 20 year history of the franchise theres a returning director at the helm with christopher mcquarrie picking up where he left off after the fun but forgettable rogue nation back in 2015 alec baldwins cia suit is now in charge of the imf and he has tasked ethan hunt tom cruise with tracking down a trio of plutonium devices before they fall into the clutches of the apostles  a group of zealots formed from the ashes of the syndicate whose founder solomon lane sean harris is ricocheting around between the law enforcement systems of various nations a calamitous decision made by hunt in the heat of battle leads to the plutonium vanishing into criminal hands and the interference of cia assassin walker henry cavill who is despatched to keep an eye on hunt and his imf team as they try to recover the radioactive material before it can become weaponised things are complicated further by the reappearance of former mi6 operative ilsa faust rebecca ferguson who has her own set of missions and loyalties mcquarrie has woven yet another tapestry of double crosses and conspiracies with fallout though its clear that this is not where the lions share of his enthusiasm lies this movies storyline is little more than a skeleton on to which mcquarrie and producerstardaredevil cruise assemble an elaborate musculature of set pieces that are as inventive as they are dangerous whether its a bruising bathroom fight a motorbike chase through the streets of a major european city or an aerial battle in which helicopters become high altitude dodgem cars mcquarrie and his fearless leading man pull out all the stops to batter the audience into submission and its in this quest that the film wholeheartedly succeeds there is action in this movie to rival anything in the best genre adventures of recent years from mad max fury roads vehicular carnage to the superhero smackdowns of avengers infinity war the climactic faceoff atop a towering asian cliff is a bruising battle of fists that is as cathartically funny as it is stunningly violent its a movie that almost dares the audience to engage in their own daredevil stunt  holding their breath for the entire third act it helps too that this franchise is now fully embracing its ludicrousness like an old friend theres a running gag characterising the imf as a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat and simon peggs tech whizz benji has dialled up the exasperation even further this new incarnation of mission impossible marks the swaggering confidence of a series that after decades of tinkering has found its identity as a cartoonish demolition derby anchored by its cruise missile of a star  willing to dangle from and ultimately jump off as many tall things as he can find these movies belong to cruise and its easy to see why undaunted by either his advancing years or the smashedup ankle he sustained during filming in london the 56yearold man of mayhem is a whirlwind running through almost every frame of the movies two and a half hours  a lot on paper but it flies by  in a constant quest to oneup his own excesses hes amply supported by his usual ensemble but he equally benefits from henry cavill effectively reprising the sneering arrogance of his character in the man from uncle in a role that is as enjoyable as anything he has done in his big screen career mcquarries comfort equally shines through in the visual finesse on show throughout the film interior scenes have a retro grain while the aforementioned finale unfolds against an eclectic climate changing from snowcapped peaks to the verdant beauty of greenery in the blink of an eye each captured with an eye for sheer beauty by cinematographer rob hardy the sound design too deserves credit for some crunching punches and deafening chases while lorne balfes score mixes old and new with a seamless sense of the same kidinasweetshop joy that powers the whole movie its not a straight slam dunk though michelle monaghan returning as hunts estranged exwife hands the film an entirely unnecessary emotional subplot that never works despite the best efforts of ving rhames in a beefedup role as hacker luther rhames shines in his comedy moments  including a particularly fraught attempt to defuse a bomb  but struggles to do as much emotional heavylifting as the script asks of him equally a british society dirty dealer played by the crowns vanessa kirby adds an injection of strange energy when shes on screen but ultimately flits in and out of the narrative without much rhyme or reason these complaints however are a mere footnote in the face of the towering achievement that mission impossible  fallout transpires to be in a movie world in which even the biggest films often feel as if they are holding plenty back for sequels its a joy to experience a blockbuster bonanza that genuinely feels as if its tossing absolutely everything it has at the audience in an attempt to deliver pure unadulterated escapism its possible for a film critic to lose sight of the joy of cinema for sure but after i spent the last 20 minutes of fallout repeating the words i bloody love movies in my head id say im in a good place for the moment
Jul 25 2020,positive,the physical proximity to each character and each movement is so minute so aurally and visually sweeping that fallout is often slick as all hell
Jul 22 2020,positive, there is absolutely no doubt as to why tom cruises mission impossible is the strongest franchise hollywood has to offer in a world where cgi rules the roost cruise and christopher mcquarrie perform their high aerial stunts in the real world delivering a thrilling ride proving every mission they undertake is certainly possible whilst not scrimping on its entertainment value events escalate no sooner as the picture opens ethan cruise and his merry men simon peggs benji and the manmade wall luther played by ving rhames manage to lose three spheres of nuclear material it proceeds to spend the next two and a half hours trying to get it back and save the world however its not that simple as the actionpacked story weaves through the european streets of london and paris with a few familiar faces popping up along the way whilst ethan is plagued with guilt and the haunting memories of his wife julia michelle monaghan ethans boss alan hunley alec baldwin returns to continuously butt heads with angela bassetts erica sloan continuing to think ethan is moderately a liability sloan proceeds to assign the hulking august walker henry cavill to accompany ethan on his hunt to thwart the most recent threat each scene hereafter is a bit like me and my shadow between the pair but there is certainly no love lost between the men as the masculinity fills the air even rebecca ferguson turns up as ilsa faust in the most random of spots not just to keep an eye on the situation but also to give the men a run for their money in the sleek fight sequences as well she also throws in that unspoken lust connection between ethan and herself softening the violent edge hats off to cruise after all these years his adrenaline junkie side is still pumping strong and taking on 99 of his own stunts even his highly publicised ankle break whilst filming a building leap has been left in its just as winceinducing as when the footage was first published but just reiterates the mans professional insanity and desire to carry on his staple running sequence is one to behold too one that has become a bit of a running joke at one point it becomes clear that cruise is actually auditioning for a role in the flash even though the humour is nevertheless present it is overshadowed by the jawdropping flawless action set pieces from watching cruise sprint through the streets and rooftops of france to the incredible punchup in the toilets of a club between cavill cruise and the chinese actor liang yang the fighting is ridiculously relentless as they are punched through walls and slammed into porcelain sinks even though the bathroom is destroyed the men just keep getting up the winning sequence comes in the gripping dying scenes in kashmir set amongst the glorious mountain setting as two helicopters manoeuvre between themselves with cruise dangling from a rope to finally cement his adrenaline lunacy its clear that mcquarrie and cruise make for an unbeatable combination on this franchise mcquarries eye for slick flawless and stunning filmmaking paired with cruises slightly unhinged grip of action fodder has created spectacular pure unadulterated blockbuster awesomeness
Jul 21 2020,positive, the sixth instalment of mission impossible opens with imf lynchpin ethan hunt in the midst of a bad dream he wakes up with a start this would be pretty routine stuff but for the fact that the films protagonist is an unstoppable spy who thrives on performing deathdefying stunts without ever worrying about the inherent dangers the human facet of tom cruises most abiding screen persona separates this action hero from most others mission impossible  fallout isnt only about the lead actor jumping of airplanes and skyscrapers hanging from cliffs and even flying a helicopter when he doesnt how to the screenplay gives the star and his coactors whether they are playing his foes or friends substantial character arcs the title has meaning that goes beyond just this episode  it links hunts actions and decisions from earlier mission impossible entries including his marriage with julia michelle monaghan his decision to temporarily quit the mission impossible force and his battle of wits with the villain of the very first film of the franchise but thanks to cruise the star who has flamboyantly anchored the mission impossible franchise since it kicked off the under the supervision of brian de palma in 1996 fallout works as a film even if one were to ignore what has gone before the central character wastes no time in swinging into action and plunging into situations that once again test his physical tenacity courage and luck the film itself is a breeze as smooth a ride as any hollywood action film of recent times it gallops full throttle but allows occasional breathing spaces that serve the purpose of setting the stage for the big moments it is not as if mission impossible  fallout does anything that is remotely off the beaten track but even as it stays firmly within the parameters of the game as it has been played in the previous five films of the tv seriesinspired franchise it manages to create an air of creative freshness and excitement christopher mcquarrie the only director to return for a second mission impossible film clearly has a way with action set pieces the manner in which he spaces out the thrills demonstrates perfect judgment and the way he imparts urgency and pace to these scenes suggest a special flair for blockbuster action interspersed with intriguing reveals and red herrings fallout opens a couple of years adrift of the events of mcquarries mission impossible  rogue nation 2015 british secret agentturnedanarchist solomon lane is still in custody since being captured by hunt however the syndicate formed by the criminal mastermind remains as active as ever the more intransigent and impatient elements within the outfit have now spun themselves off into a more dangerous group called the apostles and are plotting the acquisition of nuclear devices powerful enough to flatten the whole world the apostles the audience is told early on through an unusual cnn newscast plan to target the holiest places of the three abrahamic religions  the vatican mecca and jerusalem for hunt and his trusted aides field operative benji dunn simon pegg and techwhiz luther stickwell ving rhames it is another race against time to save humanity from annihilation in hunts lexicon humanity of course pertains as much individuals as to all of mankind so he thinks nothing of letting the three plutonium cores slip out of his grasp in an early sequence so as to ensure that one of his mates does not lose his life this act of generosity is held against him and the cia chief erica sloane angela bassett deploys her sharpest assassin august walker henry cavill to shadow hunt as he pursues the dangerous lane and his associates sloane taunts the imf secretary alan hunley alec baldwin you use the scalpel i prefer the hammer but nothing that hunt indulges in from here on evokes scalpel strokes he is into sledgehammer blows which fit in pretty neatly with the films sweep and ambition besides his exwife julia a medic he encounters in turtuk leh hunts path cross those of the white widow vanessa kirby who makes him a deal that he grabs with both hands and his former ally ilsa faust rebecca ferguson mi6 agent who is for mysterious reasons after the very objects that hunt is hunting for fallout settles into a loopy rhythm that sucks the audience instantly into its orbit the narrative scampers from one thing to another without running into complications and hindrances that could undermine the visceral hold the film establishes over the viewer but it is also a rare action film that assumes a somewhat political skew  it talks about destroying the existing world order and starting afresh from great suffering from come peace says the archvillain greater the suffering greater the peace the methods he proposes to use for achieving that end entails a huge deal of violence ethan hunt like james bond but in ways that are diametrically different is willing to go to any length to see that humanity triumphs the intertwining of the political and the moral itself makes fallout an action thriller of a completely unique timbre the fact that it also delivers a vibrant globestraddling plot high points these constitute the crux makes it all the more exhilarating
Jul 9 2020,positive, mission impossible  fallout 2018 is the best entry into the mission impossible series and is the best action film since mad max fury road 2015 throughout this latest adventure we hear super agent ethan hunt utter the phrase i wont let you down while that plays as a crucial element in the plot we can also examine it from the actor who delivers the line tom cruise at fifty six years young seems to be talking directly at us  the audience  letting us know that he will give us exactly what were looking for high octane action and death defying stunts cruise is one of the last movie stars of his kind combining his immense screen presence with a keen understanding of how to entertain he is the ultimate showman able to adapt to changing times although he has had his fair share of duds he never goes into a project without full commitment think about this the mission impossible series has gone on for over twenty years and is only getting better where many action stars fade the older they get cruise rushes forward pushing the limit both physically and mentally for our enjoyment but fallout isnt just the tom cruise show here now is the emergence of christopher mcquarrie as an elite action director the previous entry mission impossible  rogue nation 2015 was great fun and had plenty of intrigue but fallout tops it with its set pieces intricate plotting and breathless pacing the balance between practical effects and cgi is perfectly handled to a larger degree is an emotional factor that catches us off guard we get all the thrills that we expect and yet mcquarrie who also wrote screenplay sneaks in a character study that makes the material all the richer the cinematography rob hardy is assured and confident we see everything clearly the framing allowing us to witness cruise in full view of his numerous stunt work eddie hamiltons editing cuts between shots with clarity at no point is there confusion in the geography of a set piece lorne balfes score is pulse pounding calling to mind the feel of a crime thriller breaking the episodic nature of the series fallout acts as a direct sequel to rogue nation this time we see ethan dealing with the moral dilemma of being an agent  whether or not its better to sacrifice one life if it means saving millions more that idea has always existed in the background of the previous entries but here is where it comes to full fruition ethan is a man who cannot fathom making the hard choice he would rather sacrifice himself than see a single person perish its that weakness that causes ethan and his partners luther ving rhames and benji simon pegg to lose a case of plutonium into the hands of bad guys putting many lives at risk but that weakness is also ethans greatest strength motivating him to track down the plutonium with unrelenting obsession why does ethan feel the need to go out on a limb even when the goal appears unreachable the answer is the same with many other movie heroes because he has to ethan saves lives because he must and he does it like no one else along for the ride is cia agent august walker henry cavill assigned to keep a watchful eye over ethan and his team theres also the reappearance of the mysterious british agent ilsa rebecca ferguson and solomon lane sean harris the villain of rogue nation who has returned with destruction and chaos on his mind after an early expository scene mcquarrie puts his foot on the gas and never lets up fallout constantly moves even the quieter character driven moments are designed with urgency ethan tackles his mission like a mad man and cruise tackles his role in the same vein cruise performs a halo jump goes on high speed chases in a truck in a car and on a motorcycle through the streets of paris engages in a brutal hand to hand fight inside of a nightclub bathroom  and this is all happens before he famously broke his ankle jumping from one rooftop to another the shot is used in the movie all throughout mcquarrie makes the precise right decisions on how to depict the action the bathroom fight scene is done with no music allowing us to hear and feel every punch the motorcycle chase is shot from three angles in front of the bike to the side and from behind ensuring that we can see cruise is the one driving it narrowly missing being smacked by a passing car during a rescue operation a character is stuck inside of a truck slowly submerging into the seine river the camera inside captures the rising water sideways like a growing wall coming to take its victim mcquarries biggest improvement as a director is by building the tension all the way up to the climax in rogue nation and mission impossible  ghost protocol 2011 the key set piece always happened right in the middle of the plot causing the third act to sink just a bit that is not the case with fallout in which the final showdown is a spectacular feat of imagination execution and fearlessness i dare not describe it to you and spoil the fun not enough can be said about cruises fantastic performance not only in the physical sense at one point he runs so hard that it looks like hes about to take off but also as a dynamic fully developed character to ethan every life matters occasionally mcquarrie will bring the narrative to a standstill and focus in on cruises face during a moment of emotional conflict where he is faced with a decision he simply does not want to make every instance of this is effective causing us to understand that ethan is not a machine but a flesh a blood person whose acts of violence against others leave a lasting effect mission impossible  fallout is the kind of movie that causes people to fall in love with movies the craftsmanship is stellar the performances are great the action aweinspiring and the story deeply involving being a film fan means being in a constant search for an experience that puts us on the edge of our seats and grab the armrests with excitement this delivers that in spades as cruise says i wont let you down  and he certainly didnt
Jul 5 2020,positive,youll be witness to incredible helicopter chases savage fistfights and peak adrenaline full review in spanish
Jul 1 2020,positive, i walked out of mission impossiblefallout 2018 still trying to catch my breath from the 147 minutes of nearrelentless action after an afternoon of thought i had a review outlined in my head ready to write up the next day and then while i slept the sleep of the just brian tallerico went ahead and published a review that says most of what i wanted to say but much much better in sum this film is elevated action believe the hypeall of it writerdirector christopher mcquarrie doesnt mess around we come to action films for action and mcquarrie doesnt subordinate the other filmic elements to the action he carefully molds the action to incorporate other elements into a flowing organic whole character theme location that shot of the arc de triomphe the fight scenes are shot and edited to achieve complete vieweridentification with ethan hunt tom cruise especially one scene that comes off as a quieter more coherent and more exciting version of the casino fight scene in black panther 2018 therere also a couple of callbacks to the henry cavill of the man from uncle 2015 during the paris chase sequence speaking of the paris chase sequence did you know that the cruise of every shot in the foot chase had an ankle that had yet to fully heal you can read about that the 106 halo jumps and a truckload of other insanity in this piece about the stunts having said all that i was surprised to find good acting see this penetrating piece by david ehrlich and a ludicrously complex but logical and thematically resonant plot the film is about hunt trying to make up for a failed mission and having to choose the lesser of two evils at every turn he tries to make good choices but everything just keeps biting him in the ass the refrain of the film were working on it a plan alludes to hunts greatest strength and weakness relying on skill and resources over forethought the film portrays itself as a conflict between saving the many angela bassetts cia director erica sloane and saving the near alec baldwins imf secretary alan hunley but the more accurate conflict is between chess and dd in the end the film barely agrees with helmuth von moltke no battle plan survives contact with the enemy
Jun 30 2020,positive,i firmly believe that if tom cruise can die its going to be filming a mission impossible movie
Jun 20 2020,positive,the film feels tougher and less polished in all the right ways while simultaneously being bigger and more sweeping than ever before its the best of what the mission impossible franchise has to offer
Apr 14 2020,positive,every action sequence in this movie is thrillingly staged with visceral perfection
Jan 10 2020,positive,tom cruise runs on screen for ten straight minutes which means highlevel action enjoyment
Nov 11 2019,positive, it is strange to think that this film franchise a reboot of a 1960s tv series starring martin landau and barbara bach is 22 years old this year however after five films and a global gross of more than 26bn tom cruise is back as ethan hunt in the latest instalment of the mission impossible franchise with  mission impossible  rogue nations christopher mcquarrie back in the directors chair mission impossible  fallout sees ethan hunt cruise and his team try and prevent a nuclear threat from escapee solomon lane sean harris while being under the watchful eye of cia agent walker henry cavill what mcquarrie does in this sixth instalment is to integrate a comfort zone  with pegg ferguson and rhames back as hunts associates there is a familiarity and camaraderie that highlight the fact that his professional attachments are now stemming into the personal in a way it reminds audiences that imf is more than a job to hunt  it is his family given the traumatic events in the first film all those years ago we finally see the emotional effects the job has on hunt and the importance of what he has turned his back on  a normal life at 56 years old cruise shows he has the strength to take on such a physical role taking on more deathdefying stunts that easily surpass the previous mi films including one that caused a notable foot injury he reminds audiences why he is one of hollywoods leading men although the new boy in the franchise cavill is great as cia agent walker whose physicality and detached demeanour makes a perfect foil for hunt pegg and rhames provide the occasional comic relief while ferguson and kirby deliver cool and collected performances even though this is his fourth feature film fallout shows mcquarries confidence as a filmmaker despite the occasional uneven pacing he incorporates plenty of twists and turns that allow the recent syndicate narrative to come full circle in addition rob hardys stunning cinematography makes each scene incredibly sharp combined with exciting sequences such as adrenalinefuelled motorcycle chases to one of the best bathroom fights in recent cinema fallout is easily one of the most thrilling action films this year easily exceeding its predecessors in terms of action story visuals and direction mission impossible  fallout shows that there is still life in the franchise and with mcquarrie at the helm the future looks bright

Oct 17 2019,positive, it would seem impossible but the mission impossible film franchise keeps getting better and better for 22 years now paramount pictures has produced one excellent action film after another in this series and the latest entry may be their best actioner yet written and directed by christopher mcquarrie mission impossible  fallout delivers the most thrills the highest level of tension and the greatest number of how the hell did they do that action sequences of any of the m i films so far as if thats not miraculous enough its leading man is the 56yearold tom cruise and hes still giving this series his absolute all he runs jumps hangs from the rafters and performs one amazing stunt after another impossible incredible in this outing cruises spy character ethan hunt spearheads one of the impossible mission forces most dangerous assignments a terrorist organization called the apostles is threatening nuclear proliferation if their anarchist leader solomon lane sean harris is not released pronto the apostles will return the three stolen plutonium warhead cores theyve stolen upon his safe return hunts team including venerable supporting players luther ving rhames and benji simon pegg arrange a gobetween to get their hands on the warhead cores first but theyre doublecrossed at the exchange by an unknown player the nukes are now loose while imf team licks their wounds and that inspires cia chief erica sloan angela bassett to send in one of her own to chaperone the imf teams rescue mission hunt doesnt like being babysat especially from a macho thug like cia agent walker henry cavill in that serious mustache youve heard so much about the two alpha males dont trust each other and their conflict makes for truly delicious tension in every single scene they have together nonetheless they must find a way to bond for the sake of the mission and soon hunt is posing as an arms dealer to sidle up to a black marketer named white widow with walker in tow the widow is played with coy charisma by vanessa kirby from the crown and she still has her regal bearings even though shes playing a crook here adding further complications to the rescue mission are the plethora of thugs that the white widow employs and they dont trust hunt et al either making a perfect storm is the inclusion of ilsa faust rebecca ferguson their mi6 counterpart from the last movie she shows up with a vendetta against terrorist lane and hunt doesnt know if she can be trusted is she on the allies side or has she gone rogue whats walkers real role in the mission and what angle is alec baldwins hunley playing especially since he was cia in the last film before taking over the imf all these untrustworthy characters trying to work together makes for exciting tense and drolly funny interplay this outing is almost as entertaining while theyre all standing around arguing as it is when they are running around and saving the world however the set pieces are truly a cut above the quality one finds even in this fantastic franchise in fact in set piece after exciting set piece audiences will be blown away by how adroitly conceived and choreographed they all are theyre complex take place in busy locations and deliver maximum thrills throughout  a fist fight in a nightclub bathroom turns into a bareknuckled brawl that would make john wick envious a rooftop chase turns into a thrilling obstacle course for hunt rendered all the more impressive by its use of london locales and cruises acrobatic leaps and bounds and an extended car chase through the streets of paris is as amazing for all its different twists and turns on the streets as it is in the cat and mouse plotting with players turning against each other on a dime im sorry franc yet the best is saved for the last 30 minutes when mcquarrie literally employs a ticking clock and sets up an actual cliffhanger for his storys climax again most of what were watching onscreen occurs in real locations not in makebelieve green screens filmed in a contained studio this all looks incredibly real and most of it definitely is that includes cruise doing things like climbing up a rope hundreds of feet above the ground to hijack a flying helicopter granted hes probably supported by wires that have been taken out in post but hes still hovering way above the landscape few stars would ever endeavor to do something so dangerous but it makes this franchise all the more fun because its leading man relishes such challenges in a summer that has seen too many sequels already this one stands out from the crowd as its crown jewel we may be six films in but if theyre going to be as continually terrific as this the action franchise should go on and on even without the aging cruise in the lead that probably wont be any time soon though especially if he can still show the moves he demonstrates so ably in this one theres no slowing him down or this superior franchise for that matter  jeff york has

Sep 2 2019,neutral, mission impossible  fallout had the best opening weekend of the entire series with 612 million and another 946 million overseas this is the film tom cruise broke his ankle on and the film henry cavill just had to have a mustache for that made those reshoots for justice league have such disastrous results the sequel has a whopping 97 fresh rating on rotten tomatoes and an 86 metascore on metacritic critics and the general moviegoing audience emphatically and enthusiastically adore this film and personally it doesnt register why the mission impossible franchise is so cherished by movie lovers writerdirector christopher mcquarrie sean harris as villain solomon lane and rebecca ferguson as former mi6 agent ilsa faust all return from mission impossible  rogue nation this is the first film where a director and a villain have returned from a previous film the technical aspects of the film are the easiest to admire and the action sequences are outstandingly breathtaking the big action sequences include the parachutefree fall sequence with ethan hunt tom cruise and august walker henry cavill the bathroom brawl with hunt walker and john lark hunts motorcycle chase hunt running and jumping across rooftops and the insane helicopter chase its ridiculous in a good way how much room cinematographer rob hardy annihilation ex machina gives each sequence these are scenes made for seeing and experiencing in imax you can tell that the majority of the stunts were pulled off practically and green screens and computer generated effects are utilized minimally the most impressive sequence is the motorcycle chase because tom cruise races through the wrong side of traffic without a helmet in the circle around the arc de triomphe in paris but the helicopter chase features cruise climbing up a rope dangling in the air while the helicopter is airborne these sequences are extremely open with perspectives that not only make you feel like youre with tom cruise being just as nuts and exhilarating as he is but also seem to be making the statement that cruise is still crazy enough to do the majority of his own stunts at the age of 56 despite his saggy jowls many on social media were claiming that mission impossible  fallout is nonstop action over its nearly 150minute runtime but that doesnt seem to be the case the film seems to be attempting this never ending adrenaline rush found within the likes of films like mad max fury road and speed but it fails to do so the action is superb but everything in between is extraordinarily dull missing the first and third films in the franchise may have contributed to that but theres not much to miss here if you havent seen the other films in the franchise hunt obviously still cares about his exwife julia meade michelle monaghan but currently has a connection with ilsa faust the spy element of the sequel feels so cliché and predictable as every twist and big reveal can easily be predicted even if this is your first mission impossible film the inclusion of a bomb in a mission impossible film feels explosively juvenile at this point and you legitimately have no investment in these characters whatsoever with every mission impossible film thats released it seems like its main purpose is for tom cruise to be like mad tvs stuart and yell look what i can do before partaking in extracurricular activities a man in his fifties should probably be distancing himself from to be fair cruise is still more than capable of doing incredible action films and is generally a part of films that aim to be exciting for everyone fallout is extraordinary if you scrutinize without any sort of context the film knows how to make your pulse race and your palms sweat as you gasp for breath but the story is the same as any other mission impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes theres no substance here and impressive action doesnt make up for a defused storyline

Aug 14 2019,positive,it all seems so impossible but cruise is impressive and so is this film its exhausting as much as it is smart and entertaining
Aug 2 2019,positive, over the course of six movies mission impossible has basically turned into the franchise where tom cruise does crazy stunts fallout the newest entry is no exceptionand id have it no other way christopher mcquarriehe wrote and directed this film as well as its predecessor rogue nationseems to have cracked the code to this longrunning franchise in fallout the story is negligible theres enough plot to keep the momentum and the twists keep it engaging mcquarrie seems to be the perfect match to star tom cruises unique take on action the difference between the action in this movie and the action in the equally audacious fast  furious franchise is that in fallout mcquarrie captures the action in a clean and economical way its the reason mad max fury road was so successful every action set piece has a narrative pulse whether it be a two on one brawl in a bathroom or an epic car chase through the streets of paris or a halo jump from an airplanethe best scene in the film and possibly of the year in fallout we begin as always with ethan hunt cruise receiving his mission should he choose to accept it he is tasked with retrieving three plutonium cores that can be easily turned into nuclear bombs that can reek destruction on any city that the holder chooses in this case the holder is a group dubbed the apostles a terrorist organization born out of the remains of the syndicate refreshingly that main plot which is set up breezily in the cold openit features an amusing cameo by wolf blitzeris the goal for the entire film unlike the bond films or bourne films which have twisting plots that end up somewhere different than where they started fallout stays focused the apostles want to use the bombs to create a new world order by inflicting the maximum pain on the planet as they say the greater the pain the greater the peace ethans searchhes aided by a skeleton crew consisting of benji simon pegg and luther the consummate steady hand ving rhamesleads him to paris where an arms dealer known as white widow vanessa kirby is a clear standout in the role is allegedly selling the cores to a man called john lark who wants to carry out the apostles agenda however before going to paris cia director erica sloane a deliciously headstrong angela bassett forces ethan to take along august walker henry cavill sporting the infamous mustache as a failsafe from there fallout puts out some of the most impressive and thrilling action sequences ever committed to film however every action set piece has a purpose the halo jump adeptly sets up hunts moral center and juxtaposes against wilsons more brash tactics the scene which is devoid of composer lorne balfes the florida project impressive score is breathtaking mcquarrie gives every moment and action weight as the pair tumble towards the earth you feel the stakes of what is happening even if you know everything is going to come out fine every set piece is infused with those stakes at one point an armored truck carrying former leader of the syndicate solomon lane sean harris is rammed into a river instead of the truck slowly filling with water which would throw off the rhythm of the scene an intense and literal wall of water swallows lane the camera is attached to the truck to give the illusion that the water not the truck is rotating its that kind of innovative filmmaking that makes fallout a bold practice in the action movie genre tom cruise is infamous for concocting crazier and crazier stunts that he performs himself while it seemed like a publicity ploy mission impossible  fallout makes it clear why hes been indispensable until now his screen presence is irreplaceable specifically when he is performing action now that hes found a director that knows how to capture them the mission impossible franchise has found new life dont let us down ethan that is your mission should you choose to accept it hey im karl founder and film critic at smash cut i started smash cut in 2014 to share my love of movies and give a perspective i havent yet seen represented im also an editor at the new york times a rotten tomatoesapproved critic and a member of the online film critics society
Jul 7 2019,positive,      its on for the relatively young and old in the sixth mi goround with cruise rhames pegg harris ferguson and baldwin back on deck cavill joining the ranks as an     agendaheavy cia agent and christopher mcquarrie taking the reins once more after 2015s rogue nation conspicuously mia are three plutonium cores stolen by terrorists for their     usual nefarious reasons having bungled their retrieval impossible missions force agent ethan hunt cruise of course and his amiable imf offsiders benji and luther pegg and rhames are now     tasked with getting them back which brings us all to paris and the bonkers boundarysmashing stunt work that pretty much the entire world knows tcruise actually does in the     exhaustingand yet so fun to watchservice of saving mankind       because oh what beauties those stunts are with a smashing halo high altitude low impact plane jump into the city of light to blast them off and the     fanciest of motorcycle and auto footwork on the ground plus the man runs and runs and then runs some more despite an actual broken ankle that alone is something to see even before his     spectacular climactic chopper action in kashmir       when not tearing it up in ninja warrior mode the mood of the lavish production is a nice balance of purposeful to sombre everyone involved takes the business of monkey very seriously indeed     not least a careworn ethan who while still fighting fit plainly carries the shadow of a life hardlived as well he should for in essence the burden of duty is what the showboating is all     about the socalled impossible is always a trial by fire and no matter how fast you sprint that heat has eventually got to hurt 
Jun 18 2019,positive, to ask the question on everyones mind are we really supposed to care about a new mission impossible movie without the return of jeremy renner as everyones favorite character um i want to sayhawkeye renner jokes aside although everyone should always stop to make those the most ridiculous stunt involving this series is that it has somehow existed for 22 years understandably that longevity has bought the latest film mission impossible fallout some measure of forgiveness for its hubris in assuming we actually retain plot points after these films are over selfimportant and impossibly troubling to anyone who remembers how tom cruise has allegedly treated women in real life fallout is ultimately a pretty fun watch even if it does feel like an uncomfortably long passionate kiss slurped on the lips of practical stuntwork despite a distinct lack of tinkering or tailoring writerdirector christopher mcquarries lecarre ambitions bloat what should have been a kinetic macguffin chase ethan hunt cruise is tracking down three plutonium shotputs before bad guys can nuke stuff with them somehow that singular sentence is stretched into 150 minutes the best of which see henry cavill a punchable meatsack getting walloped in his infamous mustache benji simon pegg and luther ving rhames are back to soak up more screen time without offering a single modicum of actual character over the course of a halfdozen movies all we know is that luther often wears hats and benji is almost funny sometimes the series has become this monolithic memorial to the integrity and sacrifice of ethan hunt who is a lucky idiot that makes bad choices like that was his real accepted mission isla faust rebecca ferguson returns from the last film and immediately betrays her country and her own wellbeing because she is powerless before ethans puffyfaced running the love of ethans life julia michelle monaghan whom he abandoned because his boner belongs to freedom before all else appears to seemingly reassure audiences that her life as a woman only has meaning through ethans context thankfully the execution of preposterous stunts is feverishly meticulous with layered components that feel like glorious rube goldberg machines of death have you seen two helicopters slapfight before what about fisticuffs that use bathroom plumbing parts as deadly weapons in all seriousness fallout could have been a silent film and been legitimately better than the version that exists with oops all berries amounts of exposition to the franchises credit it appears they are setting angela bassett up as ethans new handler they have wisely figured out how using a recurring bad guy saves handwringing villain origin screen time and the white widow vanessa kirby is exactly the sort of minor player that could help make mission impossibles next 22 years more fun just please remember in the future that when your target demo is men who are likely keeping an eye on their prostatic lab work maybe pare things down until its just the oohs ahs and oh nos
Jun 3 2019,positive,this is toptier action filmmaking the kind of noholdsbarred ballstothewall extravaganza that manages to root its spectacle in actual human emotion
May 26 2019,positive, although the usual media blitz associated with a tom cruise vehicle is in full swing much of the attention is understandably focusing on the reallife injury that made it into the final cut of mission impossible  fallout the sixth installment in the 22year old franchise such an onset injury not only gets people talking but cruises passion is on full display in his dedication to giving the audience what they want even at his own expense and thank goodness tom cruise is nuts find out just how nuts here but hes nuts oncamera for our benefit and the mission impossible franchise is all the richer for it recordbreaking 80million dollar insurance claims aside fallout is chockfull of breathtaking stunts like the one in which cruise busted his ankle which is also featured in the trailers along with a shipload of exposition right up front luckily the filmmakers wisely followup on such pretitles setup repeatedly during the movie so its reinforcedyou dont have to remember all of it on your own viewing all five of the earlier installments is also unnecessary but it wouldnt hurt since past characters resurface since the filmmakers make it a point to explain everything and everyone albeit sometimes in a hamfisted way but you may have to go to the bathroom during the previews since fallout is a bladderbusting 2 and 12 hours but at least you dont have to sit through the entire credit roll since there is no endcredits tag but mi6 is fun exciting and overthetop right where it needs to be except for some seriously funny overacting between newcomer henry cavill and series staple angela bassett but dont let their scenechewing distract you since you need to pay attention fallout features multiple doublecrosses which overlap as the runtime wears on fallout would have benefitted from some tightening in its exposition to be sure but also even in some of the extended actionchase scenes which would have corrected its main flaw being unnecessarily overlong the plot is admittedly somewhat standard stuff bad guy threatening civilized society with blackmarket nukes but in the capable hands of writerdirector christopher mcquarrie mission impossible  rogue nation edge of tomorrow and cruise who also serves as producer such stereotypical actionflick fodder is elevatedvia equal parts personal vendetta andto something else the action event of the summer
May 21 2019,positive, above all else mission impossible  fallout is an action movie it has nothing particularly cogent to say about espionage politics or human interaction but it has a lot to show in the way of action sequences three immediately stand out and there at least another three that threaten to rival them one standout is a very straightforward chase scene our hero tom cruises secret agent ethan hunt is on a motorcycle pursued by dozens of police in cars at every corner the chase seems to go on forever and ends with a riveting bang but for good measure were also given a car vs motorcycle standoff a helicopter showdown and a three person bathroom fight none of these sequences is extraneous or perfunctory instead they are thoughtfully and expertly rendered with technical proficiency film were often reminded is a visual medium but its the precision of the sound effects and the smoothness of the sound mixing that turn these action sequences from good to excellent listen for the rev of the engine as a stationary motorcycle finally takes off the screech as a car skids off  the dizzying sound of a fist connecting with muscle the cacophony of a vehicle hitting into a truck hitting into another vehicle those incidents are par for the course in this genre but the immersive soundscape of fallout is not just coasting on the familiar but offering a dizzying sometimes disorienting aural trip for the audience a trip that deepens when the sound mixing opts for moments of silence in between key points or to let that catchy mission impossible theme seep into the narrative this movie sounds better than most if not all 2018 releases even when what its actually saying becomes ridiculous the initial mission of fallout is compromised early on when hunt botches a job because he opts to save a member of his team and allows some valuable weapons to be stolen and so he must now hunt down some missing plutonium that could create anarchy in the world via the nuclear weapons made from it this early decision is key to the view fallout has of hunt as the action hero who cares about the individual life of one as much as the collective lives of many its meant to represent his nobility but fallout works worst when it tries to argue for hunt as a moral arbiter of excellence cruise is a reliable action starthe series would not work without his tenacitybut hunt is strangely hard to root for as a character who is not near as charming or emotionally compelling as the film makes him out to be this is an action movie so naturally hunts task of stopping a terrorist group from carrying out a deadly mission with nuclear bombs ends up being more complicated than we anticipated its a strange setup as beyond the abstract worry of world destruction theres little real suspense as to what becomes of this mythical contemporary world that the series represents but geopolitical verisimilitude is not on the menu here it doesnt need to be what we do have is ethan hunt on a breathless new adventure with a number of complications thrown in he has the new director of the cia breathing down his neck an underused angela bassett enunciating as if her life depended on it a beleaguered boss a beleaguered alec baldwin his trustworthy sidekicks ving rhames and simon pegg who do fair work but often feel thrown in to prop hunt up which becomes slightly annoying a former coworker and potential adversary in the form of rebecca fergusons ilsa decisive and compelling even when the film gives her little to do and a more direct foil in the figure of the cia assassin hes forced to work alongside in the figure of henry cavills agent walker cavill is my favourite in the cast by a mile even though his role as large as it is still feels underdeveloped cavill nails the tonal shifts between fullblown action and reluctant comedy with panache its a confident performance that is just the right note of ironic to become subversive but fallout is not a film for actors to show their chops especially if their name is not tom cruise like any film in the series it is ultimately only cruise who is provided with a real platform for much depth the emotional stakes when they come late in the film make me shrug even though they are meant to be emotionally profound ethan hunt just is not that compelling and the films almost sycophantic view of him of course a new female character must find him so beguiling she must make out with him in a heated moment does not help the situation it doesnt really matter though because christopher mcquarrie with his direction more than his screenplay has injected fallout with enough technical finesse that this action movie thrills enough and so even the most ridiculous of situations make you gasp from the spectacle of the action rather than strain credulity at the levels to which you must suspend your disbelief for it to make sense more style than substance but what style
May 15 2019,positive, the mission impossible tv series always had a strong focus on teams but ever since the entire team was killed off in the first movie the focus has been on ethan hunt tom cruise while the first entry is a classic it only seemed to get worse with the second however by the time the third movie came along they were more willing to bring on supporting players including the first appearance of benji dunn simon pegg then the fourth movie arrived and it was like they completely changed genres they embraced the team dynamic entirely and the franchise became better for it this sixth entry leans in on that even more and is easily the strongest in the series so far director christopher mcquarrie didnt want to come back after directing 2015s rogue nation but paramount pictures and cruise were able to convince him to return it was a good thing because mcquarrie has found a way to amp up the action scenes while also realizing that these supporting players are what set this series apart from the bournes or the bonds the latter of which tend to waste the talents of the supporting players for fallout mcquarrie brings back the fantastic isla faust rebecca ferguson ethans wife julia michelle monaghan and new female characters as well were missing brandt jeremy renner because renner was off filming the avengers movies at the time but there are plenty of awesome people here to pick up the slack the marketing has been playing up the absolutely insane action scenes and they are rather spectacular they are also varied which is nice this isnt just one car crash after another  it manages to cover all the bases of action movies the fights are brutal and the stakes are clear so we understand what happens if the bad guys win we get plenty of character beats and henry cavills augustus walker is a welcome addition to the team as somewhat of an antithesis to hunt thats not to say there arent flaws but they are at most nitpicky it runs a little long but you dont feel that until you have to stand up after the movie ends its a little too obsessed with doublecrosses and backstabbing there might be one too many by the end but it doesnt drag the movie down too much mission impossible  fallout isnt a perfect movie but its about as close to mad max fury road quality as an action movie has come in a long time this series continues to get better and its been extremely entertaining watching an action series like this find itself in its recent entries
May 4 2019,positive, up to this point each mission impossible film has operated on their own mechanisms  the 1996 brian de palmadirected original felt like an organic extension of the 1960s television series it drew its inspiration from the 2000released sequel was an orgy of unsubtle combat buoyed by the favouredslow motion of hong kong filmmaker jon woo jj abrams second sequel in 2006 felt slightly more grounded in comparison coming off like an appendage of the directors own tv project alias 2011s ghost protocol under the eye of brad bird the incredibles adopted the imax gimmick and went for broke in what possibilities lay in extravagance and christopher mcquarries rogue nation in 2015 adhered to the modern temperament of the genre by delivering spectacle that didnt overrun an intricate story so where do we sit with fallout the 6th entrant in this surprisingly robust series   one that has defied expectation at practically every turn  is very much a continuation of rogue nation perhaps earning it the right to be considered the series first legitimate sequel  christopher mcquarrie the first director to pull returning duties behind the camera clearly knows how to juggle the extremities of the genre and whilst he is working with a story that is rife with obstacles he never lets it get the best of him and why should he when he wrote the damn thing  instead he places trust in his ingredients and whats the one base flavour that is sure to never fail one mr tom cruise at this point its getting a bit tired to continually defend cruise from an acting perspective  his personal life and beliefs are open to criticism but as an entertainer hes undoubtedly one of the most committed to the craft  since the series conception cruise has been performing all his own stunts and much like each respective film theyve only gotten more highstake ie dangerous as theyve gone along  it was highly publicised that cruise fractured an ankle bone during a stunt that required him to leap from rooftoroof throughout a londonbased sequence the footage ultimately remains in the finished film and instead of taking the recommended 9 weeks off he returned to set a mere 5 weeks later only to shoot a sequence that required extensive running throughout the streets of paris  you cant tell me that isnt dedication to your job as for why cruise is jumping across rooftops and running throughout parisian streets well thats because his unstoppable imf agent ethan hunt is looking to foil the nuclear plot of a mysterious villain known only as john lark the leader of a group of international libertines dubbed the apostles  lark is due to score a suitcase full of plutonium through a trade with a sensual arms dealer known as the white widow the crowns vanessa kirby seemingly channeling vanessa redgrave and its come down to ethan and his righthanders luther stickell ving rhames and benji dunn simon pegg to infiltrate the deal this would all be well and good if ethan wasnt being monitored by strapping assassin august walker henry cavill proving the justice leaguedisrupting moustache was worth the growth called out by cia director erica sloan angela bassett who believes hunt is no longer as dedicated to the job as he should be  add to that complication the return of rogue nations shadowy mi6 agent ilsa faust rebecca ferguson and homicidal anarchist solomon lane sean harris and youre left with a plot that could potentially buckle under its own weight it does help to pay attention to the various double even triple crossing mcquarries script throws about with reckless abandon  not helped by the onslaught of action setpieces that have been masterfully choreographed to steal focus at every turn  but theres a brilliance at work here where everything falls so neatly into place once the dust has settled  but really who cares about details when the films alphas hunt and walker graduate from a dazzling handtohand combat in the mens room of a parisian nightclub to a helicopter chase above the clouds of kashmir before battling atop a towering cliff all the while a duo of bombs begin their inevitable countdown towards expected doomsday when it boils down to it fallout may still be somewhat cliched in terms of genre mentality but it knows how to toy with the expected and present itself as a fresh product that we cant help but gobble up in excess  now is it too early to request mi7
Apr 16 2019,positive, your mission should you choose to accept it is to watch mission impossible fallout and not get swept away by the oldschool overthetop spy chaos should you choose to accept this mission youll join tom cruise as he confidently returns to the role of ethan hunt indestructible secret agent someones stolen some plutonium and hunt has to round up his chums in the impossible mission force for more deathdefying gravitydefying and frankly commonsensedefying action scenes a lot of movies are referred to as rollercoaster rides but in this case it barely seems like a metaphor very few films throw its stars and audiences around quite as much as the mission impossible series and this adrenalinepumping sixth outing is no exception as cuttingedge as the stuntwork is the word fallout seems like a faintly quaint title this oddly dusty term evokes the nuclear paranoia of the cold war rather than the more modern preoccupation with devious data and sinister surveillance often seen in todays espionage thrillers and mission impossible  fallout does have a certain oldschool feel to it the story begins in belfast and berlin two cities that have put their troubled pasts as geopolitical hotspots of skullduggery behind them the bad guys wear moustaches and impeccable threepiece suits and the implausible hightech gadgetry is kept to a minimum  even the iconic introductory tape comes hidden in a book pleasingly for anyone struggling to distinguish the mission impossible franchise from other allaction espionage movies at least one part of the teams plan comes straight from the original 1960s tv show you might also spot echoes of the dark knights and the french connections most memorable action scenes not to mention surprising similarities to the most recent james bond movies  of course the title isnt really a reference to the devastation thatll be wrought should the imf team fail to retrieve the contraband nuclear material it refers to the fact the film is basically tom cruise falling out of things helicopters planes windows cliffs huge sewer gratings there isnt anything cruise wont fling himself into onto or out of in the name of a thrilling action sequence youve got to hand it to him you really feel like its cruise himself rather than a digital double doing all the running and jumping and what running and jumping it is im not sure theres anything to quite compete with the realisation that it was actually cruise clinging to the side of an actual skyscraper in ghost protocol or to the side of an actual aeroplane in rogue nation but the relentless breathless action scenes still set the standard for big loud set pieces its definitely worth seeing fallout in imax format or even in a 4dx theatre  one of those rollercoasterstyle theatres with seats that tilt and vibrate while jets of air and misted water are sprayed over you  mission impossible  fallout was my first experience of 4dx and i cant decide if its the worst thing thats ever happened in the history of cinema or the perfect way to watch this kind of ridiculous adrenaline ride randomly flashing strobe lights are annoying and your seat jostling you at inappropriate moments is distracting but when slower movement is twinned with subtle onscreen camerawork its surprisingly effective at drawing you into the moment and i admit by the end when the screen is just filled with absolutely nonsensical carnage it actually makes sense to have your seat jerking around so violently you feel like youre about to be fired through the screen where youll find yourself blinking in the street picking popcorn out of your hair and wondering what the heck just happened fallout isnt just delirious action though its mostly delirious action there is also some cinematic deftness on display alongside the theme park convulsions director christopher mcquarrie and cinematographer rob hardy inject some elan between the action particularly in a stylish silent shootout a sinister opening dream sequence and a party that seems to come from another age these quieter scenes also give composer lorne balfe room to breathe with brooding teases of the iconic mi music  before unleashing a bombastic sonic barrage chaotic enough to match the visual bombardment british actors rebecca ferguson and sean harris return from the previous movie rogue nation bringing a real touch of class even if theyre underused thankfully jeremy renners useless sidekick from the last two films is jettisoned to make way for moustachioed henry cavill a cia agent whos the hammer to ethan hunts scalpel cavill is meant to be a wild card brought into the fold to keep an eye on the team and ready to shut things down if necessary mostly though hes too useless to be threatening coming across as a dimwitted lummox rather than a credible menace anyway where was i  oh yes your mission should you choose to accept it is to come out of this ludicrous movie without a smile on your face as always should you or any of your force not be caught up in the comically overthetop capers the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions wait a minute is this thing on
Mar 30 2019,positive, watching mission impossible  fallout on the big screen i was worried i was being too obnoxious to my neighboring audience members i crackled with glee and more than once threw my hands up in disbelief i had to react physically i just couldnt help myself the things i saw  tom cruise doing a halo jump from five miles up tom cruise on a highspeed motorcycle chase around paris tom cruise making ankleshattering hops across rooftops tom cruise dangling from a helicopter and tom cruise piloting a helicopter like its a bumper car  demanded my reaction filmmaker christopher mcquarrie mission impossible  rogue nation jack reacher deserves a lot of credit for pushing his and cruises talents to the edge in a film that does far more than simply tack on an addition to the franchise he evolves the series from safe summer blockbusters to something that feels wildly tangible and terrifying to watch seeing cruise perform all these stunts himself some of which took over a year of training is something you dont get from most movies in a film world littered with greenscreen solutions to everything you dont often see actors putting their lives and limbs at risk to fuel a stronger reaction from audiences it makes the action all the more immersive and intense knowing the filmmakers and talent went the extra mile and as a result we get one of the most thrilling action movies ever made the plot falls in line with many of the other mission impossible films but enough is shaken up to keep it fresh in fallout ethan hunt cruise must square up against a nuclear threat from the hands of imprisoned anarchist solomon lane sean harris giving us his own reservedbutcreepy rendition of heath ledgers joker rebecca fergusons ilsa faust returns a change of pace for a franchise whose women are usually nowhere to be found by the next installment and crosses paths on a conflicting mission of her own with mi6 meanwhile cia agent august walker henry cavill and the most expensive mustache is assigned to watch ethans every move leading to many trust issues amongst the outfit while the cast brings its agame also including ving rhames simon pegg alec baldwin and series newcomers angela bassett and vanessa kirby the film comes most alive during its jawdropping action there are fist fights car chases foot chases and helicopter chases that ignite the fuse of excitement to describe them in greater detail wouldnt do them justice especially one incredible set piece in paris which like mad max fury road is a long chase sequence that on many occasions will make you go ooh ahh and ouch then theres the best scene of the movie  and believe me there are too many great scenes to count  and it features a bathroom brawl to the death the scene got a big reaction out of my audience most notably when cavill throws his enemy through a mirror and cocks his arms like theyre guns mcquarrie and cruise also a producer push scenes such as this further than you think they ever could and it raises the stakes in a fashion that makes the limitations of these characters completely unpredictable theres also an incredible amount of intelligence put into fallouts character moments solomons plot to use bombs to create as he and the other baddies put it a suffering large enough to bring about great peace puts ethan to the ultimate test cruise isnt afraid to show physical and emotional vulnerability this round hes always played ethan as this invincible superhero who could face any mission but here he is challenged like hes never been before one key scene shows ethan wrestling with the decision to let a police officer die or give himself over to the missiondriven man he needs to be its like solomon is inflicting his own philosophy of the greater the suffering the greater the peace on him does he let one person die or does he fail the mission at hand he finally deals with the weight of his decisions and it elevates the material fallouts greatest flaw may also be its greatest asset the film surprisingly shares a lot of dna with christopher nolans directed works principally the dark knight from the smooth and inventive cinematography to the hans zimmerlike score trivia composer lorne balfe worked with zimmer on the dark knight films and story beats you can draw many comparisons but any movie that takes a page or in this case several pages out of the dark knight it arguably improves the quality of the product just look at skyfall like the dark knight fallout provides more than a mere heroversusvillain story theres much more on the playing field than obstacles laid down by the villain at one point in the film solomon asks ethan why he chooses to accept these missions for ethan the answer is obvious he can save the lives of many and therefore it doesnt matter what stands in his way even if its death for cruise its also apparent to top what he has done before
Mar 2 2019,positive, well here we are 6 films into a series that has taken up 22 years of our lives with mission impossible  fallout being the most insane entry yet but also the most fun  this time around ethan hunt tom cruise manages to lose solomon lane  the big bad from mi rogue nation and the leader of terrorist members only the syndicate hunt sets off with imf members benji dunn simon pegg and luther stickwell ving rhames  whose voice i find so intoxicating i honestly dont know why im not at arbys every day to find lane again starting with trying to buy some stolen plutonium  the pursuit of the plutonium of course involves a ton of overthetop action sequences tom cruise speeds through the streets of paris on a motorcycle tom cruise parkours across paris rooftops tom cruise flies a helicopter through narrow canyons tom cruise gets the shit beat out of him again and again and again for your entertainment tbh i do find that entertaining  of course thats not all this is mission impossible so the complications keep piling on until the films exhausting satisfying conclusion at 2 hours and 27 minutes youre ready to go home and give your eyeballs a rest  everyone knows im way more of a fast  furious fan than a mission impossible fan but watching fallout was big stupid fun it helped that i was sitting in a row with my mom and a bunch of guys im lucky to call my friends so we could all ooh and aw over the same parts and laugh our entire faces off at the sheer ridiculousness of it all  and even though henry im afraid to ask out women because its so hard to be a straight white man cavill is now on my shit list it was still entertaining to see his engorged arms operate almost independently from the rest of his body while completely and totally dwarfing tom cruise in every scene they shared  aside from the pure escapism of this film i loved so much about it i loved every bit of action that was on screen i loved watching the team work together to save the world  masks and all  up against a impossible haha deadline and i even loved the way luther gave ethans new special lady friend the dl on his previous special lady friend also oh hey wes bentley whatchoo been up to
Mar 1 2019,positive, the mission impossible film franchise is one of the few that somehow got better and better after its third sequel struggle to make a dent at the box office not only did the later sequels were financially successful theyre also critically darlings looking at rottentomatoescom mission impossible 46 received mid to high 90 rating after a mission gone wrong and three nuclear missile heads are in the hands of a new group of terrorists known as the apostles ethan hunt tom cruise and his teammates benji simon pegg and luther ving rhames must retrieve the weapons when hunt

upset that the imf team lost the nuclear heads and insists that her agent august walker henry cavill must go with ethan to retrieve them first on their task is to capture and impersonate a man named john lark liang yang and meet with a mysterious woman named white widow vanessa kirby in paris who has the connection to the apostles but when hunt and walker met with white widow she insisted that they must break out an international terrorist and hunts nemesis solomon lane sean harris from prison or they wont get the nuclear weapons of course this complicates the mission but both hunt and walker went along and helped lane escaped along the way hunt ran into an old friend ilsa faust rebecca ferguson shes also has her own mission and that is to eliminate lane for good well things never go as planned and hunt must use all of his skills to try to save the world from chaos and also save those who he cares about for the first time in franchise history the same director and writer christopher mcquarrie of the previous film has returned and take charge of this new mission to my surprise mcquarrie has exceeded what he created in the last picture he crafted a complexed storyline thats full of twists drama humor and big action sequences by hiring new crew members notably a new cinematographer and composer he was able to differentiate this film from the last one its clearly that he used nolans the dark knight as his inspiration for this outing the film even contains a big chase thats very similar to a chase sequence from the dark knight a big bathroom brawl a spectacular motorcycle and car chase through the streets of paris and a helicopter chase are the highlights of the set pieces cinematographer rob hardy is having a good year he shot the excellent annihilation for alex garland earlier this year and again for this film he did a tremendous job this film contains so many wide shots in the series since woos mission impossible 2 this is good because we the audience can actually see the action and not trying to figure out whats going on super chaotic scenes shout out also goes to composer lorne balfe who apparently is the understudy of hans zimmer so of course this films score sounds like its was composed by zimmer theres still the well know mission impossible theme but balfe made it sounded like something very original just a little trivia hans zimmer did compose a mission impossible film he worked on the second one with three box office bombs in a row cruise poured all of his performance into this film he did the usual crazy stunts but was willing to show his characters age and flaws by having him get his ass whooped a few times in the film the rest of the cast members were pretty good too i was afraid fergusons ilsa faust might just be nothing more than a cameo but her role was an integral part of the story and as usual she saved hunts life couple of times in the film simon and luthor didnt really have much to do except to be comic relief luther did have a touching scene with ilsa i really liked that scene i liked the addition of alec balwins character and he even got involved in one action scene with the team members bassett and cavill were a nice addition and i hope we see more of bassetts character in the next mission film kirbys white widow is an interesting character and i thought she played the role quite well even though she didnt get a lot of screen time having seen the film twice already i can declare fallout is the best mission impossible film yet its full of humor great tensions and spectacular actions sequences if theres an imax dolby cinema or other large vendor theater near you go see it there its definitely my favorite film of the summer and maybe even of the year glad you enjoyed it too cindy i havent felt this way about a summer blockbuster probably since i saw the dark knight ten years ago i agree with you ted mission impossible fallout is especially worth it in imax i saw it at the mn zoo imax over the weekend glad ivan and i saw it at zoo imax too ted the scenery is spectacular and its got all the action stuff i like dayum the motorbike chase scene is killer im afraid one day cruise will perish doing one of his crazy stunts yeah and cruise is 56 years old i dont know when hell give up this franchise and hand it off to a new lead but all those running jumping and flying helicopter he seems to have some kind of a death wish easiest review i have written all year so much pouring out of my mind to say its such riveting whiteknuckle cinema and i cant wait to see it again hey keith glad to hear youre fan of this one too i had high expectations for it after seeing the trailer but never thought it exceeded my expectations saw this on friday and had a blast with it as well that fight scene in the mens room was amazing as was seeing tom cruise doing lots of running again plus that scene below the helicopter was stunning film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Feb 27 2019,positive, im not the biggest tom cruise fan but when i first saw the trailer for mission impossible fallout i was excited in the sixth installment of the mission impossible franchise ethan hunt tom cruise and his imf team benji simon pegg and luther ving rhames race against the clock to correct a mission thats gone terribly wrong in an action movie i dont go in expecting great line delivery or even chemistry between characters most of the time i just want great fight choreography and big stunts mission impossible fallout delivered on the former and the latter the additions of agent walker henry cavill and erica sloan angela bassett made for great interactions and when cavill delivered his lines they were just as intense as reloading his fists in that bathroom fight scene from the trailer not to mention that bassett and cavell together have so much chemistry that i wish they were a part of the same comic book cinematic universe the imf team of ethan benji and luther are as in sync as ever with perfect comedic timing when needed and great gadget exposition when the times call for it rhames even has an emotional scene towards the end of the film with ilsa faust rebecca ferguson unlike other action flicks the movie was strong because of its characters and script not in spite of it i want to note that this installment of the mission impossible franchise has more stunts than any other not only are they grand examples of adventure but the focus on practical effects the insistence of cruise to do his own stunt work and the use of real locations make its action stong in a visual and visceral sense the only issues i have with the film are that some of the action scenes dragged on too long there are pieces of the action sequence where the only sound used is the score although the music in this movie is great 30seconds of prolonged running doesnt get better with a great track with a car chase that just kept going and silent moments of ominous walking i cant say this movie was perfect that being said for a summer action flick with an amazing cast new and old i can overlook that piece and firmly say that i would love to watch mission impossible fallout on the big screen again even if its only to watch a supercut of tom cruise performing his own stunts appearing in the trailer the rope climb onto the helicopter and jumping onto the other building  which resulted in a broken foot  are just two stunts out of an actionpacked two and a halfhour ride i would love to watch mission impossible fallout on the big screen again even if its only to watch a supercut of tom cruise performing his own stunts appearing in the trailer the rope climb onto the helicopter and jumping onto the other building  which resulted in a broken foot  are just two stunts out of an actionpacked two and a halfhour ride kate sánchez is the founder and editorinchief of but why tho a geek community there she coordinates film television anime and manga coverage kate is also a freelance journalist writing features on video games anime and film her focus as a critic is championing animation and international films and television series for inclusion in awards cycles satoru gojo is the heart of jujutsu kaisen season 2  now heading into cour 2 here is everything you need to know about the character 
Feb 25 2019,positive, so the last few weeks of moviegoing have certainly had their ups and big time downs make sure you are following me on my youtube channel because some films i review there and some here just some content speaks more to writing an essay and others to a video lol also make sure you are following me at smilingldsgirl on stardust and letterboxd to have these mini reviews sooner i did a full review for sorry to bother you so i wont include that here but there are still 11 films i have seen since my last update there were some highs and some definite lows the first mamma mia is a bit of a guilty pleasure its not a good movie but its effervescent vacation porn with some catchy songs sung terribly in the sequel we get catchy effervescent vacation porn but sung well so im on board i really liked the entire cast and thought lily james was great as a young meryl the movie didnt judge her character but just presented her life and gave us happy energetic songs thats all i needed a little more meryl would have been nice but thats the only problem i had with it i have been listening to the soundtrack all summer im not normally someone who decries spoilers in fact i find that super annoying but in the case of three identical strangers try to go in spoiler free the twist blew me away this is an incredibly engaging film it starts out funny and light and then becomes something much darker i was moved and amazed if it wasnt a documentary you wouldnt believe it could be true i have never seen an episode of teen titans go but have heard nothing but how terrible the show is and how it is an affront to the original teen titans i also was not impressed with the trailers so you can imagine my surprise when i walked away having had a great time i laughed harder at teen titans go to the movies than i have at any other film this year except for game night it was a hilarious satire on superhero movies and tropes i also enjoyed the 2d animation with its comic book aesthetic and the voice cast from the original show were great nicholas cage also gets some good laughs at superman i just really enjoyed it while not as well written as some of the best of this franchise mission impossible fallout is a great action film the action set pieces are above reproach and they happen so much and so quickly that i never had time to think about the story or be bored while watching the cast is all great including tom cruise who is evidently willing to do anything to get a compelling action scene i still think ghost protocol is the best of the franchise because of its story but this is darn good i wish the women had been used a little bit better but thats a small nitpick the spy who dumped me is a frustrating film of unmet potential kate mckinnon and mila kunis have good chemistry and the action is shot well but its tonal shifts were jarring making the movie unpleasant and long it had some silly moments but then mixed with brutal violence nudity and other harsh content it was offputting the tone was just all over the place and it felt like mckinnon was the only one trying to make things work but even that got old after a while im not the biggest horrorthriller fan but i do love gabrielle union so i thought i would give breaking in a shot unfortunately it ended up being a pretty mediocre film its not terrible and there are some entertaining moments but as a whole it didnt work i liked the kid actors and gabrielle union is great as usual but its all extremely by the numbers and generic they also obviously decided to make this pg13 at the lastminute so there are tons of freakin where obviously the f word was intended which is distracting its no secret i havent been a big fan of these disney live action remakes but i was actually excited for christopher robin my hope was it would feel fresh and sweet like the great petes dragon remake unfortunately i was disappointed the entire premise didnt work for me with christopher forgetting his promise to pooh and becoming the tired evil man of business this left the 100 acre woods as kind of gloomy and sad with the characters waiting for christopher to return christopher is supposed to be a terrible parent but in reality he is working to save his entire team their jobs hes the hero they should have had his daughter madeline find pooh that would have made way more sense since she is being sent to boarding school her interacting with the friends of the 100 acre woods might actually been magical here it is just a weak version of hook and paddington without eithers whimsy and charm especially compared to paddington the only things i liked were the overall aesthetic a scene at a train station where pooh gets a balloon and a bonus credit song by richard sherman other than that this movie was an eeyore everyone knows i love a good romance but the cinemas have been alarmingly short of them in recent years if you like romances check out my podcast on hallmark films hallmarkies podcast before seeing crazy rich asians i read the book by kevin kwan and for the most part the film does a good job adapting the novel it stars constance wu and the super hot henry golding as a couple who are dating in america but things get rocky when he takes her to meet his crazy rich family in singapore for what it is trying to be crazy rich asians is just about perfectly executed its funny romantic sweet and big hearted i thoroughly enjoyed it the cast is great including awkwafina who stole all her scenes michelle yeow plays a convincing villain because her point of view makes sense it might be a cold view but it comes from her life experience so it is reasonable overall its a movie that has it all i know the title is a mouthful but i loved the book so was very disappointed to hear this was not going to go to theaters but only to netflix sometimes that can be a sign of a poor film but not in this case i really loved it lily james is wonderful as juliet an author who starts conversing with a man from guernsey and learning the story about his secret book club this society or club helped them get through some tough tiems during the german occupation the entire cast is wonderful including a very dreamy michael huisman and penelope wilton who is always great in everything matthew goode has a wonderful supporting role as juliets publisher friend sidney its beautifully filmed by mike newell and will make you want to go to the channel islands they do a good job mixing the light and fluffy with sincere and moving moments i loved it i wish we could at least get a fathom event to see it on the big screen for one night only come on netflix im normally not a big fan of these ensemble films like i hated mothers day and new years eve however dog days proved to be a pleasant surprise while it will be too cheesy for some i found it really sweet and heartfelt pretty much every storyline worked for me my favorites were an elderly man and teenager trying to find his dog and a family with a newly adopted little girl bonding over a dog i also liked a romance between 2 news anchors that grows because of their mutual love of dogs it was sweet funny and i teeared up a few times dog days is a charmer and now for the movie that made me want to die i had a feeling duck duck goose would be a bad movie but as someone who loved son of bigfoot last year i always go into films with an open mind unfortunately duck duck goose proved to be even worse than i could have imagined it is right up there with norm of the north for one of the worst animated films i have ever seen i hated the animation i hated the characters i hated the humor i hated the weird attempts to appeal to a chinese market i hated the unearned sentimentality i hated how mean spirited it was and just overall unpleasant i hated the villain cat i am someone who liked the nut job 2 so i dont just dismiss films like this but it was atrocious in every respect do not show it to your kids there are plenty of other things to watch on netflix i enjoyed mission impossible fallout even more than i was anticipating  i dont know why i was surprised    maybe its because this is the sixth entry and i was expecting to see some signs of fatigue in the franchise by now  the last three have been uniformly outstanding  this just might possibly be my favorite although ghost protocol is definitely up there too one of my favorites of the summer again another nice variety of movies mission impossible was an absolute blast i cant wait to see it again christopher robin is one i havent seen and for some reason cant muster any enthusiasm hoping to see guernsey literary this weekend
Feb 16 2019,positive, 5 things you might want to know about mission impossible fallout spoiler free and in about 5 minutes stay tuned for the best ever challenge at the end
Feb 16 2019,positive, so after catching up on all the awards season favourites and others i missed over the last 12 months my ultimate summation of 2018 in cinema overall is that it wasa mixed bag i mean there were some absolute gems this year but filling out this list with worthy candidates was a lot harder than it has been in previous years i wouldnt say it was a bad year for film though i just dont want to linger on negativity anymore which is a big reason i havent done a worst of list this year and probably never will again moving forward as a critic i want to put celebrating cinema first and foremost but by no means does that mean im going to stop writing negative reviews or turn my brain off it just means less disparaging humour and more practical critique with that said i do genuinely love every film on this list even though i could nitpick plenty of them if i was so inclined in a year that was otherwise filled with uncertainty and impending crisis we need to focus the positives we do have and in some ways that makes the great movies we did get this year even sweeter so enough with the procrastinating on with the list we had two dramas about conversion therapy this year and whilst the miseducation of cameron post was a solid effort boy erased goes just that little bit further into driving home how dehumanising a practice it is joel edgerton continues to hes just as talented a writerdirector as he is an actor if not more so with this tale of a young man attempting to find himself through this abusive process lucas hedges lead performance is yet another stellar role in a stillyoung career whilst russell crowe nicole kidman and edgerton himself deliver some of their best work in recent years it is a harrowing but necessary reflection of the bigotry still present in our society and one i hope can open up a few hearts to acceptance it seems ever more unlikely that we are ever going to see a third raid movie but this spiritual successor featuring two of its stars is a more than worthy substitute the night comes for us is a straightforward but compelling crime thriller that leaps quickly into the action and rarely lets up from there every fight sequence in this film would be the landmark scene in any western action film but all are executed with topnotch choreography and slick cinematography and editing top it all off with a manic leading man turn by joe taslim and fun supporting turns from the likes of iko uwais zack lee and julie estelle and this is one lovers of dark bloody action extravaganzas should not miss out on moonlight director barry jenkins once again returns to exploring the africanamerican experience through this emotionally devastating adaptation of the james baldwin novel an everrelevant look at racial bias in the justice system if beale street could talk somehow manages to find beauty and heart in the unjust tragedy of two lovers kept apart by prejudice bolstered by phenomenal performances and nicholas britells gorgeous score this is yet another notch in jenkins already welladorned belt winters bone director debra granik returns to once again explore the dark side of rural america in this sombre and affecting drama ben fosters lead performance as a veteran wracked with ptsd living in the forests of oregon is a career best but young thomasin mckenzie is the true revelation here as fosters precocious daughter she holds her own against veteran actors and comes away with not just the movie but our hearts a true indie gem likely to be looked over by general audiences and the academy leave no trace is the perfect antidote for those wanting something other than multimillion dollar blockbusters and flashy awards bait the rape revenge subgenre is often used merely for sleaze and in this day and age its a trope we should have left behind long ago but then here comes revenge a biting and relentless retort to the concept that indulges in its b movie inspirations whilst setting itself apart with a definitively feminist pointofview coralie fargeat in her feature debut directs with style and grit painting a visceral picture that never shies away from being bloody or racy but manages to avoid falling into exploitation its premise is simple and the characters basic but they all serve the greater purpose of genre critique and that simplicity allows the film shine with some of the best nonverbal storytelling in recent memory matilda lutzs lead performance is a starmaking turn and her character of jen has the potential to become a cult icon for female lovers of action and horror cinema she truly is the ultimate final girl apparently you can make the same movie four times and still make it work as this 2018 remake of the 1976 remake of the 1954 remake of the 1937 original certainly proves who knew lady gaga was this good an actor or for that matter that bradley cooper was this good a singer and director wonderfully updating the timeless story of rising fame and fallen stardom to our modern perception of celebrity a star is born will tug at the heartstrings of even those who have seen this story play out time and time again plus the music is just gorgeous perhaps wes anderson should just stick to making stopmotion pictures because that seems to be the only time i can ever stand his kitsch isle of dogs is a beautifully animated and wonderfully witty animated adventure through a nearfuture japan with an allstar cast lending their voices to the slew of pups that are our heroes probably the most accessible film in andersons catalogue to date it has just enough cute factor to keep younger audiences engaged whilst providing oodles of hidden depths and background humour to make it an even richer experience for adults yorgos lanthimos brings his peculiar view of the world to the british costume drama in this biting and unnerving dark comedy that is also effectively a twisted parody of pandering oscar bait dramas olivia colman emma stone and rachel weisz all deliver careerbest performances in this quirky look back at the politics of yesteryear reminding us that governments have always been rife with squabbling selfserving backstabbers whilst the lobster for me remains lanthimos perfect treatise on his view of humanity the favourite is a morethanworthy companion piece that brings the sleaze and debauchery back to a genre often lacking in it rapper boots riley makes his feature directorial debut with this wonderfully bizarre dystopian dark comedy that defies reasonable description most easily if reductively summed up as brazil for the woke generation sorry to bother you mixes biting sociopolitical satire and excellent performances from a varied cast with outlandish imagery and imaginative direction there was no other movie like sorry to bother you this year or in most years for that matter and i cant tell you much more than go watch it without giving away everything this is a movie you need to see cold black representation in cinema was certainly big this year but lets not forget we also had the biggest western film with an allasian cast ever this year too and a really great one at that crazy rich asians is a classic romantic comedy done right indulging in the fantasy and glamour of the situation audiences want but also layering it with plenty of smart gags emotional depth and social commentary constance wu makes for a charming leading lady in the vein of early julia roberts henry goldings starmaking turn could charm a hundred snakes at once whilst akwafina constantly threatens to steal the show cant wait for the sequels melissa mccarthy too often sells herself short with the glut of subpar comedies she puts herself through so colour me thankful she hasnt forgotten who good of an actress she can actually be a witty and filthy caper about forgery and the literary business can you ever forgive me balances comedy and crime expertly and mccarthys pathetic yet relatable performance as lee israel is a careerbest richard e grant is equally brilliant as her flamboyant accomplice jack hock giving easily his best performance in years whilst marielle hellers direction is whip smart and captivating more movies like this please mrs mccarthy spike lee returns to greatness with his best and most approachable film in over a decade telling the shocking and often even hilarious truelife tale of how a black police officer infiltrated the ku klux klan john david washington makes a strong leading man debut as ron stallworth with adam driver ably supporting as his sceptical partner along with topher grace in a surprising turn as kkk leader david duke that will make you both cringe and laugh with some of the best cringeinducing comedy around and the most gutpunching final codas to a movie in recent memory blackkklansman is exactly the kind of movie we need in our raciallyfraught climate how can a franchise keep getting better after over two decades running its the same question we ask every time a new mission impossible movie comes out and its one we may keep asking until tom cruise either gives up or dies whilst perhaps not the strongest film in regards to plot or character fallout wins for simply delivering some of the best action sequences of all kinds in recent memory every chase every fistfight every daring stunt all of them shot and directed to as near to perfection you can get there isnt a moment in fallout you will find boring and i will say it again how on earth are they going to top this one its taken a while for drew goddard to follow up his feature directorial debut the cabin in the woods but the wait was certainly worth it in my eyes a characterdriven nonlinear multistrand period neonoir thriller with an allstar cast and a cavalcade of snappy duologues its practically a film buffs fantasy bad times at the el royale certainly takes a few pages from the tarantino playbook but moves beyond mere pastiche to say something about not only our past but also our present and possible future trends and behaviours are cyclical after all definitely the most underrated film of the year and one i hope eventually finds the cult audience it deserves most ya books and their adaptations promote a filtered idea of rebellion and justice but the hate u give skips the allegories and fights the real corruption in this hardhitting but thoroughly digestible drama anchored together by amandla stenbergs breakout lead performance this film is unabashed in calling out police discrimination biased media framing cultural appropriation and casual racism without having to apologise for itself with films like this and love simon taking ya stories in a more progressive direction i think this is truly a sign the next generation are to be trusted more than anyone in charge right now the screenwatch subgenre has seen its fair share of usage but its not caught on in the same way found footage did a decade ago however searching uses the style as more than just a gimmick telling a simple but gripping thriller mystery with nothing but webcams and google searches john chos performance as an apathetic father launched into a desperate quest to find his daughter is a career highlight and aneesh chagantys direction perfectly captures the paranoia and uncertainty of the internet age a sleeper hit easily missed by many this is one of the few films i can think of that may actually benefit from being watched on a laptop rather than on the big screen alfonso cuaron only graces us with a film every so often but every time it is so worth the wait returning to his routes after several bigbudget outings roma is a simple but effective sliceoflife drama destined to go down in history as one of the masterpieces of foreign cinema featuring phenomenal performances from a cast of unknowns and nonactors led by an especially heartbreaking turn by yalitza apricio this is easily cuarons most personal film to date its a piece of cinema that whilst mostly grounded in the mundane finds the grandeur and cinematic potential in every conceivable moment cuarons beautiful blackandwhite photography is gorgeous and features some of the best shots in cinema this year and that beauty that makes it so tragic that most audiences myself included never got to see this on the big screen on the plus side roma being a netflix film means you have little excuse to miss out on it put aside some time sit back and experience the potential cinema still has as an art form
Feb 13 2019,positive,  since 1996 and over six installments special imf the impossible missions force agent ethan hunt tom cruise has been spectacularly figuring things right in the face of danger often without a plan in fallout  hunt is older and wiser but definitely not slower hes still as slick and smooth but now he takes time once in a while to pant a little and catch his breath   same old ethan is at it again and as the franchise is wont to do theres a largerthanlife plot where the world is at stake yet again and only one man can save the day theres a thrilling plot with plenty of delicious subterfuge oneupmanship and double crossing but thats not the lure of a mission impossible  film cruises highest grossing film series lassos in its fans with a different charm its the deathdefying stunts the pleasurably perfect fitting of implausible puzzle pieces and of course the actor himself  mission impossible  fall outdirector christopher mcquarriecast tom cruise ving rhames simon pegg rebecca ferguson sean harris michelle monaghan alec baldwin henry cavill angela bassett vanessa kirbystoryline terrorist outfit syndicate wants to destroy the world with plutonium activated portable nuclear weapons agent ethan hunt has to once again save the day fallout is possibly the best of the six mission  films with director christopher mcquarrie also behind 2015s mission impossible  rogue nation  upping the ante magnificently the films plot is complicated enough to lull you into a sense of comfort with its slightly arduous first hour but when things start unravelling it does so by keeping you constantly at the edge of your seat no one quite does a chase like cruise and fallout  has them all from an onfoot catandmouse game to speed boats and even cars hunt on a motorcycle will give you all the necessary adrenaline to want to ride invincibly against the flow of traffic and for the final knockdown punch theres a helicopter sequence above snowclad mountains with gunfire thousands of feet in the air   in fallout  three plutonium cores will be used to make portable nuclear devices that can destroy the world to secure them hunt has to pluck the leader of terrorist outfit syndicate solomon lane sean harris off a police convoy previous characters like ilsa faust rebecca ferguson and alan hunley alec baldwin and fellow agents luther stickell ving rhames and benji dunn simon pegg return then theres the addition of cia assassin august walker henry cavill sporting that controversial moustache that got his superman in trouble in justice league    mcquarries action is superb at times involving handtohand combat  often with the conspicuous absence of a background score  is intense and potent without the swiftness of an orchestrated and practised attack cavill especially shines during his fights a break from his characters composed demeanour its easy enough lose yourself in the directors sleight of hand but hunts crazy stunts will certainly yank you back to earth mcquarrie who has also written fallout  crafts a rewarding blockbuster succeeding in pushing the envelope with the right dose of humour an unprecedented amount of action and an explosive bangs worth of entertainment for your buck  comments have to be in english and in full sentences they cannot be abusive or personal please abide by our community guidelines  for posting your comments  we have migrated to a new commenting platform if you are already a registered user of the hindu and logged in you may continue to engage with our articles if you do not have an account please register and login to post comments users can access their older comments by logging into their accounts on vuukle
Feb 11 2019,positive, no one expected mission impossible  fallout to be bad but the risk of repetition runs rampant any fears that this franchise would flounder without its trademark oneanddone directors can be promptly put to bed  rogue nation this aint christopher mcquarries second shot is a reinvention of his own gold standard building on the successes and motifs of the five before it and making something new  and better not content with making the series best instalment sorry mi2 mcquarrie and cruise may have delivered the entire genres greatest entry once mif hits screens bond and bourne  both evoked throughout  no longer have a scratch on ethan hunt ultimate action hero tom cruise crushes his performance and his ankle in his defining role equal parts superman and somehow everyman the relentless drive and energy he puts into this project is clear in every scene famed for doing his own stunts its not meant to be this hard to say which of the many many exceptionally imagined setpieces is the most impressive  viewers are spoilt for choice rebecca ferguson  one of the best parts of the excellent rogue nation  returns in a much reduced role and however smartly its toyed with the plot can be obvious these can be forgiven however for making the longest of six films feel the shortest jamming it full of action and humour using exquisite craftsmanship in both look and sound and giving us henry cavills moustache few films truly deserve to be seen on the biggest screen you can find but this is certainly one of them one problem there is not a screen large enough to contain the eyepopping heartstopping spectacle and thrill that is mission impossible  fallout this summers  years  must see marvel  moonlighting as a reviewer and editor im more at home with recent films than golden oldies and enjoy appreciating the technical achievements as much as the escapism of the movies happy to try any film once if only for fifteen minutes i also volunteer with medicinema  a charity which every film fan should look into if they dont already know about
Feb 6 2019,positive,mission impossible  fallout once again relies on coherent wellexecuted action set pieces a few moments of winking dialogue and cruises complete willingness to hurl himself headlong into harms way if it might allow him to win our love
Feb 1 2019,positive,christopher mcquarrie has brought together a great cast and crew to bring his screenplay to life
Jan 31 2019,positive, tom cruise is still out here defying the laws of time and space  and mission impossible  fallout proves it the sixth film in the 22yearsandcounting franchise opens at the box office this weekend to a lot of buzz this a blockbuster that somehow feels like its been two decades in the making the end result of a slow distillation of the action genre it is unfettered by such problems as logic realism or physics it is two hours of marveling at a man four years shy of 60 doing all his own stunts it is surprisingly oldfashioned in its message that there are still good people in government who care about the individual welfare as well as the greater good but to really appreciate this latest impossible mission one must understand all of the missions that have come before it the original film was part of an earlier smaller reboot era during the mid 1990s when hollywood mined tv shows from the 1960s and 1970s for big screen fodder the brady bunch movie was released in 1995 george of the jungle in 1997 mission impossible in 1996 like the tv show before it mission impossible was a spy thriller loosely inspired by james bond the film was popular enough to warrant a second installment in 2000 but that felt like the end of the line and it was until 2006 when star and producer tom cruise decided to reboot the franchise with jj abrams at the helm cruise and his producing partner at the time paula wagner backed the entire project and cruise took a major pay cut to make sure it stayed within budget since then cruise has put out a new mission impossible roughly every three years each of which has slowly improved on the last this a blockbuster that somehow feels like its been two decades in the making the end result of a slow distillation of the action genre the problem with action movies in general is that they are fightfirst plotsecond endeavors many times the story no matter how simple is pushed aside to make room for stunt work and combat sequences mission impossible as a franchise has had five directors over six films each of whom has attempt or hasnt to solve these issues in their own way mission impossible  fallout is notable for being the only film in the franchise with a returning director christopher mcquarrie who helmed the last installment mission impossible  rogue nation mcquarries familiarity with the material as well as the decision to draw upon the events of the last adventure makes this film feel less like a standalone project and more like a traditional sequel ultimately this is a good thing because it helps the film balance plot coherence with action all while maintaining the proper tone the plot of the movie isnt that important and a description of it would sound ridiculous anyway all viewers need to remember is that tom cruise is a good guy and henry cavill is not everything else including characters who flip from bad to good sometimes in the same scene is secondary but as long as the audience remembers that whatever cavills character the hilariously named august walker is doing is bad and whatever cruises character ethan hunt does  even when it makes zero sense  is good theyll be able to follow the twists and turns this binary simplicity also hearkens back to the original tv shows roots launched in the 1960s it was a show about the good people of the government taking down the bad forces of chaos maintaining law and order in a world where the social order was rapidly changing but as cynicism about the american governments intensions grew shows that lauded them uncritically decreased in popularity in order to keep up with the times the 1996 film finds ethan hunt being doublecrossed by his government allowing the agent to be good but the government to be bad over the years that cynicism has slowly faded the newest installment ends with a cia official angela bassett all but apologizing on behalf of america having seen the error of her ways and pledging to help keep governmental institutions honest from now on if only it were so easy believing in the good of complex institutions like the government is an important aspect of cruises character this maybe makes sense given that in real life cruise is one of the worlds most famous believers in institutions some would call questionable and make no mistake this is his film of course so has every other mission impossible  hes produced them all but theres something uniquely personal about this franchise cruise has played a lot of roles over his career plenty of them awardwinning his time in the spotlight has also been exceedingly rocky but somewhere around the midaughts it feels like cruise decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life playing ethan hunt the publicity tour for mission impossible iii went about as badly for him personally as possible  most people dont remember now but his infamous couchjumping incident  was actually supposed to be in service of his sexy action hero comeback and yet cruise didnt really care how much his reputation suffered or even how much critics like his movies  he was going to make more anyway the dogged perseverance  rain shine or march of time be damned  is also partly why the films keep getting better as cruise and company figure out what works and what doesnt and what works is cruiseasstuntman while superhero films are full of stuntmen and cgi cruises oldfashioned commitment to doing his own stunts with as little cgi as possible lends a real superhero  or at least superhuman  feel to the films born in 1962 cruise is 56 years old he doesnt look it however as his face seems eternally frozen at 39 ½ this phenomenon  impressive if a little creepy is made more obvious by the franchises only costar to last all six movies ving rhames rhames who at 59 is three years cruises senior looks like a man who has grown too old for this stuff not cruise whether running at top speed along rooftops jumping out of windows or flying flaming helicopters aimed at henry cavills face cruises endurance is extraordinary but if cruise is the greatest thing about mission impossible  fallout hes also its greatest weakness his character hunt does not have the trading facesandactors timelessness of james bond because hes only ever been played by one actor so while the franchise may have finally hit its stride its star seems determined to play the lead until he dies and no matter how good his training regimen and medical team the idea that cruise will be able to keep doing this at 59 or 62 seems like its own mission impossible on the other hand with box office estimates predicting cruise will have the biggest opening weekend of his career  ever  i wouldnt be surprised if audiences and critics are marveling at his stamina once again in another three years ani bundel is a cultural critic who has been writing regularly since 2010 her work can also be found at elite daily and wetas telly visions where she also cohosts telly visions the

Jan 29 2019,positive, under the direction of christopher mcquarrie mission impossible  fallout is the follow up to rogue nation the sixth installment of the mi franchise continues to incorporate tom cruise as imf agent and team leader ethan hunt for the present adventure he teams up with his loyal friend luther ving rhames imf field agent benji dunn simon pegg former mi6 agent ilsa faust rebecca ferguson and cia assassin august walker henry cavill hired to control all his moves  they all engage on a suicide mission in an attempt to dismantle the apostles a terrorist group that emerged from the extint the syndicate after the capture of its anarchic leader solomon lane sean harris the group is illegally dealing plutonium cores in europe and hunt is assigned to retrieve the hazardous material however the secret agents fail to accomplish the mission in berlin when ethan decides to put luthers life in first place leaving the new director of the central intelligence agency erica sloane angela bassett in a pile of nerves with the agents double life featured through an encounter with his estranged wife julia michelle monaghan the film advances at high speed relying on the tension created by interminable and often overdone motorcyclecar chases that take us to inevitably packed crossroads and confined dead alleys besides this we have supplementary manhunt mania in kashmir this time involving a plane and a helicopter agile physical confrontations advanced technology methods and dangerous transactions with sudden ambushes coproduced by mcquarrie cruise jj abrams super 8 star trek star wars the force awakens and jake myers dunkirk the revenant interstellar this blockbuster satisfies in its purpose but doesnt earn the title of impossible to miss
Jan 19 2019,positive,such will be cruises monument and to quote watership down perhaps it would not have displeased him
Jan 19 2019,positive, mission impossible is a rare franchise that gets better with age the trilogy reboot during this decade easily surpasses the previous three the big bold and breathtaking ghost protocol and impossibly thrilling rogue nation are now topped with fallout while each mission impossible is typically a standalone movie fallout is a fallout of rogue nation villain solomon lane sean harris might have been captured and his syndicate organization got dismantled but his network isnt totally obliterated his associates have formed apostles and proceeded with his mission of a new world order disrupting government structures and creating anarchy through sabotage strategic assassinations and massannihilation ethan hunt tom cruise edge of tomorrow oblivion jack reacher failed a mission in belfast because he refused to sacrifice his team luther stickell ving rhames and benji dunn simon pegg  plutonium canisters are now in the hands of the bad guys which will be used for nuclear bombs the cia now gets involved to the dismay of the secretary of imf alan hunley alec baldwin head erica sloan angela bassett black panther assigns an agent august walker henry cavill  justice league batman vs superman dawn of justice the man from uncle to accompany the imf team to recover the canisters to say that things are not as straightforward is an understatement theres arms dealer white widow vanessa kirby tangled in the web and she may or may not be what she seems to be  british operative ilsa faust rebecca ferguson the greatest showman shows up and like in rogue nation her intention and allegiance are not always clear even the cia itself is fractured and there may be an enemy within layers of twists and turns have always been the hallmark of the mission impossible series and its something that distinguishes the series from generic action movies this and cruise himself  he may just be a superspy himself defying age and limits of the human body  he continually performs deathdefying feats with incredible audacity vitality and velocity after scaling the burj khalifa and clinging to the side of an airplane in past movies he thrusts into a brutal brawl skydives in a lightning storm rides a motorcycle sans helmet against paris traffic sprints across london rooftops leaps between buildings climbs up a rope tied to flying helicopter and free falls onto its cargo takes control of the cockpit and engages in a heli pursuit in khasmir barrels down inside the heli dangling from the mountaintop and scales a rock face to get to a detonator see it in 3d if you can closeups of cruise doing daredevil acts and clear sweeping panorama make the scenes suspenseful and breathtaking to watch christopher mcquarrie the tourist the only director invited back a second time in the series films the scenes with deft direction and precise execution fallout has multiple crosses switcheroos surprises oldfashioned stunts relentless pace and total momentum  it also manages to touch into ethans personal backstory and internal sacrifice hes made the personal sacrifice is what enables ethan hunt to continue to do what he does at this point in his life his relationship with his ghost of a wife julia michelle monaghan source code is in a good place and he may finally be ready to move on nathalia aryani is a rotten tomatoesapproved film critic rottentomatoescomcriticnathaliaaryani  she has a movie blog the moviemaven sdmoviemavenblogspotcom  twitter themoviemaven she can be reached at email protected currently you have javascript disabled in order to post comments please make sure javascript and cookies are enabled and reload the page click here for instructions on how to enable javascript in your browser
Dec 31 2018,positive,no movie this year delivered spectacle better or more consistently for its running time
Dec 31 2018,positive, fallout brings little that is new to the mission impossible franchise it also brings everything that is new its not a contradiction as you would assume to the first point it follows similar currents that the other films established such as deathdefying missions with deathdefying stunts villains wanting to overturn the current world order the reliable sidekicks pegg rhames the beautiful love interests ferguson monaghan and all sorts of psychouts and lastminute reversals that will make you giddy like lucille bluth whenever shes fooled by gene parmesan oh you bet i threw that arrested development reference in there on purpose dont knock me for it as to the second point well i think we can all agree tom cruise has never flirted with death so closely before this film makes all his prior stunts look like cakewalks the halo jump is of course a spectacular set piece in itself but i was probably more nervous watching him zig and zag through parisian traffic on that motorcycle and then scaling that cliffside while nuclear bombs were seconds away from detonating you know everything will turn out fine as it always does but that ethan hunt cuts it too close combined with cruises unfulfilled death wish and youve got excitement piled on excitement how did audiences stay in their seats during this did they i could barely stay in mine while i really do like this and i really do the scripts bulk can be felt at certain times the extended helicopter chase didnt need to be extended for instance its the only set piece that i felt dragged on longer than it should have i also wish they gave vanessa kirbys character a better arc she seems to be included here as more of a plot device and considering how good she is whenever shes onscreen its a shame shes dropped as soon as her impact is made it wouldve been neat for instance had she taken over ilsa fausts role and was the blackclad assassin on the motorcycle instead of ferguson as it is i hope kirby is allowed to return for the next one assuming there will be a next one ultimately my favourite thing about this entry is its heart the performances from people like rhames ferguson and monaghan have a purity to them that makes you care about this highoctane extravaganzaand its deathcheating action hero the thematic preoccupation with a single life being just as important as the lives of millions is also a nice bit of humanism a touching attribute of hunts that centers why we continually root for him its easy to write it all off as tom cruise playing himself but its not that simple in many ways cruise is playing a version of himself that he would like to be a version that can walk the tightrope of mortality and help those in the most danger its a version that will never translate to the real world but heck who cares let the man escape death if he wants to well be watching for as long as he does
Dec 22 2018,positive, when it comes to the mission impossible film franchise theres the john woo installment and then theres all the rest that is to say theres mission impossible ii the sole bad entry in the series and then there are the other chapters all of which have been remarkably consistent in delivering highcaliber thrills this designation includes the sixth and latest picture mission impossible  fallout and its hardly a knock to state that its not quite as compelling as all the other nonwoo endeavors it may not ascend to any new heights but it also wont send viewers home disappointed tom cruise has spent this series playing superman rather than everyman but here he takes it a step further his character of impossible mission force agent ethan hunt is now basically god lording over his domain bestowing his blessings on the worshipful mortals around him and remaining indestructible no matter how hard the satanic emissaries in his midst try to bring him down in this entry hunt has his hands full trying to retrieve three plutonium cores that were stolen from right under his nose hey even god makes mistakes negotiations to recover the cores involve releasing master anarchist solomon lane sean harris returning from mission impossible  rogue nation from imprisonment a proposition that leaves hunt queasy also thrown into the mix is special agent august walker henry cavill ordered by cia head erica sloane angela bassett to tag along with hunt and his trusted accomplices luther stickell ving rhames and benji dunn simon pegg clearly walker has a hidden agenda but hunt is equally as preoccupied with the reemergence of ilsa faust rebecca ferguson returning to the espionage fold in order to take out lane folks not familiar with the mi series will need a scorecard to keep track of the various characters but then again would anybody be foolish enough to join an existing franchise for its sixth installation just know that alec baldwin returns as imf secretary alan hunley jeremy renner does not return as imf agent william brandt hey remember when renner was briefly being groomed as the new mi face until cruise apparently decided he wasnt ready to put himself out to pasture and the crowns vanessa kirby joins the ensemble as an ebullient black marketer known as the white widow even as far back as brian de palmas original film from 1996 many of the muscular action setpieces showcased in this series defy belief and the ones featured in this latest picture dutifully follow suit yet the exhilaration they promote provides most of them with a free pass  the same cant always be said for the vehicular chases and this movie offers backtoback dashes that eventually prove wearying then theres the case of cavill  his character of the mysterious august walker is intriguing but he remains such a stiff performer that some of the life is drained from the scenes in which hes required to convey ambiguity ultimately though these are minor quibbles when compared to the energy and exuberance flowing through the majority of the picture dont expect any crippling fallout to greet the release of mission impossible  fallout on the contrary its safe to assume that a seventh installment is already making its way to the drawing board now whether cruise will remain in the hunt remains to be seen
Dec 22 2018,positive, there isnt much left to say about mission impossible fallout while overall its not quite as great of a film as youve heard it rates an a when it comes to rousing action the practical stunts are hairraising and its far and away the best film in the franchise you likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster but i will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible its frantic and fun setting the bar high for mainstream action films featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography when the clock starts ticking theres a thrilling sense of real danger  especially when tom cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter its a visual stunner that isnt burdened with flashy cgi effects which in itself is refreshing cruise who famously does most of his own stunts shows that hes never too old to be a credible action hero his ethan hunt is flawed but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us hes one of americas last true movie stars and he outdoes himself here the likable supporting players simon pegg rebecca ferguson ving rhames are sadly still playing second fiddle with the exception of henry cavill as a tagalong cia suit a perfect film its not but its awfully easy to overlook the problems a textbook story the draggy length some nonsensical plot holes alec baldwins distracting and shouty nonperformance because this movie is all about one thing the thrilling action scenes there are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite although i could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work and thats what audiences will flock to see the plot doesnt really play a significant factor in the creative if mostly unbelievable story and its twists grow from wow thats cool to ridiculous eyerolling whoppers no true lover of action films will care because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words buckle up not my type of film louisa but youve certainly done it justice with your review im sorely tempted i may send my son a text saying take a look in fact it seems like the type of film id be prepared to see at gold class luxury seating spot on review  it was predictable at times but i didnt mind  action is an understatement  advise your readers that if they do go see this dont forget to breathe
Dec 21 2018,positive, one thing you can expect in a mission impossible movie is a yawning wide shot of some exotic cityscape populated by a sole tiny figure producerstar tom cruise whose construction of this monster franchise around himself is a corollary to the image itself cruise could never top the previous mi installment rogue nation 2015 in which he hangs off the side of an airplane for real at 5000 feet but writerdirector christopher mcquarrie returning from the last film honors the series perfect formula of a userfriendly plot anarchists have acquired plutonium they must be stopped and epic action sequences ironically the most entertaining element of all may be the stars advancing age cruise well into his 50s scores numerous laughs as the increasingly confused and harried cia agent ethan hunt leaping into one spectacular stunt after another and then wishing he hadnt with henry cavill ving rhames simon pegg and rebecca ferguson
Dec 21 2018,positive, mission impossible  fallout starts out strong and gets better and better and then just when you know it cant get any better than it already is it gets even better than that until everybody staggers out of the theater exhausted and exhilarated its what a summer movie used to be and should be its just terrific before the credits are even flashed onto the screen fallout has already delivered more excitement narrative interest and surprises than most action movies do in two hours the thought crosses the mind where can it go from here the answer is pretty much everywhere it keeps on going and going following one exciting sequence with another and then another there are two things to marvel at aside from the fact that tom cruise is 56  and only now has begun to look like he might be in his 40s the first is how these action sequences are devised most action movies deal in cliches and their only innovation is to make the cliches bigger  bigger explosions bigger car crashes bigger chases  and it never really works but fallout consistently demonstrates an astonishing creative invention in these sequences writerdirector christopher mcquarrie mission impossible  rogue nation comes up with new ways of doing things and new ways within those ways every time you think youve outguessed him you havent the second marvel is yet more impressive and thats that the effectiveness of the action has to do with more than thrills and titillation in fallout every leap chase and tense moment is bound to the story and to the personal relationships within that story having cruise at the center certainly helps  everybody likes tom cruise including all the people who tell you they dont and so theres a rooting interest but this goes beyond cruise this is story construction character creation and a directorial instinct for when to ease off the pedal and when to floor it the stakes are high  of course  they are ethan hunt cruise is given a choice assignment to find three silvercolored balls of plutonium a little bigger than a bocce ball that have been stolen from the russians and are being sold on the black market he teams up with his crew luther ving rhames and benji simon pegg and goes to make the purchase but ends up blowing the assignment he screws up for some good reasons but he screws up all the same and the plutonium gets into the hands of a nihilistic terror group that thinks that the path to peace is through great suffering or some nonsense like that so now ethan has to find the terrorists and also the people working with the terrorists and he has to assume a false identity for a time and hang out in paris and london and somewhere in asia  hes doing all sorts of things while people are coming at him from every direction and while one of his own men played by henry cavill is plotting to discredit him yet as complicated as fallout is and as difficult it would be to describe with certainty every turn of the story and what it means the movie is always clear in terms of whats going on in the moment for example theres a scene in paris in which ethan and his group are trying to steal a heavily guarded prisoner from the french police but in order to do so they have to doublecross the underworld characters theyre working with and manage somehow not to hurt a single paris policeman the sequence seems to go on for about a half hour and every moment is specific and riveting and thats not even the best sequence in the movie one of the least appreciated things about cruise in general is that the women in his action movies are rarely appendages theyre always in the thick of things and theyre always interesting in their own right rebecca ferguson is back as ilsa complicating everything by showing up on a motorcycle and shooting at people for reasons that become clear only later michelle monaghan has somewhat less fun as ethans exwife but vanessa kirby princess margaret on netflixs the crown is full of insinuation and mischief as an international arms broker known as white widow smiling at cruise like shes about to devour him and acting like a villainess  on the old batman tv show of course one of the most appreciated things about cruise is that so much of what he does onscreen is real he really does those leaps between buildings he broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks he really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic he really does fly a helicopter who knows what motivates this guy but the results are tangible with mission impossible  fallout cruise and mcquarrie have made the best film in the franchises history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie  in several years mick lasalle is the film critic for the san francisco chronicle where he has worked since 1985 he is the author of two books on precensorship hollywood complicated women sex and power in precode hollywood and dangerous men precode hollywood and the birth of the modern man both were books of the month on turner classic movies and complicated women formed the basis of a tcm documentary in 2003 narrated by jane fonda he has written introductions for a number of books including peter cowies joan crawford the enduring star 2009 he was a panelist at the berlin film festival and has served as a panelist for eight of the last ten years at the venice film festival  his latest book a study of women in french cinema is the beauty of the real what hollywood can learn from contemporary french actresses
Dec 18 2018,positive, if you go to a bachelorette party on an island and the other guests put a huge bloody fish head on your pillow you are in a horror movie not a romcom maybe at this point in the history of capitalism theres not much difference crazy rich asians looks more like a glossy tourist magazine produced for an international economics summit than a movie while henry golding just misses the mark at being an actual angloasian cary grant maybe next time constance wu playing an asian american everywoman comes off generic a paper doll dressed first as a professor then as a disney princess among the too numerous cast ronny chieng and victoria loke stand out as a sarcastic meanspirited young husband and wife who despise each other unlike the unmemorable gemma chan and pierre png who play a more prominent unfunny version of the same thing i would gladly watch an entire movie about chieng and lokes shallow disrespectful welldressed irritants wasting their fortune while struggling to maintain their status the film is framed by a satirical lecture featuring alec baldwin as a john birch society racist and documentary footage of the 2017 unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia in which heather heyer was killed by someone who could be this baldwin characters grandson what comes in between is an actioncomedy that supposedly takes place in colorado and mixes together in standard spike lee style police investigations blackhistory lessons ruminations on genre cinema and a dismantling of the birth of a nation complaints that blackkklansman valorizes cops are moot since this film could not exist without them any more than a sidney lumet film like serpico or prince of the city could just like in those films the cops here are a rogues gallery of new york types now transposed to colorado their dialogue slips into a version of eyyy im john turturros brother are we gonna get these klan scumbags or what adding to this brooklyn feeling a triumphant scene takes place in sunnys waterfront bar in red hook lee establishes the scene with sunnys redandgreen anchoranddolphin neon sign showing us that this is just one of those nauticalthemed saloons you find a county over from the rocky mountains lee made the didactic blackkklansman to move audiences which he succeeds in doing despite the feeling that the film has been stitched together from everywhere if the love scenes between john david washington and laura harrier fall flat unlike their period hairdos its because they are the bland good people in this movie which foregrounds actors like ashlie atkinson who plays the selfdeluded racist wife of a klan goon like shes a transplant from the bensonhurst of the honeymooners the film works well when washington puts on his white voice to prank call klansmen he aspirates the word white with the precision diane keaton brought to the word wheat in love and death without the crutch of being dubbed by a white comic as in sorry to bother you his phone routines could have gone on longer which would have added to the satiric intensity of the movie more than alec baldwins slideshow meltdown alec baldwin is everywhere in 2018 as a bigheaded squinty illustration of american authoritys collapse in the latest mission impossible movie he returns as tom cruises boss the leader of a spy agency more rogue than the cia his confrontations with angela bassett as the cias head are tepid they distract from cruises epic struggle to maintain his status as an action hero a fight cruise wins via grueling stunt work on the roofs of the world cruise is a liveaction testament to his own ability to take punishment a kind of human sacrifice he is undiminished by both time and all the semicomedy around him which is the story of his career and his life mission impossible  fallout begins with a harrowing dream sequence like vanilla sky called into question at his wedding as a failure who puts his loved ones in jeopardy cruise spends the rest of the film trying to make up for it by putting random people in danger up to and including everyone in china india and pakistan  a third of the worlds population and a substantial market for films like this everyone who is not in cruises squad is formidable vanessa kirby as a british arms dealer more threatening and coolly appealing than any woman in a recent bond film sean harris as a steve bannonesque alleged mastermind strapped to a chair watching cruise relentlessly pursue and destroy henry cavills doublecrossing cia hunk whose dialogue seemed dubbed was really satisfying if anyone has earned the right to victory over a british superhero actor twenty years his junior with a porn mustache its the movie star who has managed to avoid the trite universes of dc and marvel even if it took being in that mummy film to do it in the first equalizer denzel washington played an exintelligence agent working at a home depot in east boston massachusetts what made that movie work was how real washington and director antoine fuqua made employment at home depot feel as if someone involved had done time in the pvc pipe and lumber aisles they had the layout down the new one starts with washington disguised as an imam on a train in turkey with a big beard a white skullcap and blackframe eyeglasses a look he pulls off better than anyone else in the past thousand years while this is a change from working at home depot the equalizer 2 is not quite a mission impossible movie soon he is back in boston where he now works as a lyft driver and still lives alone in a small apartment during one of his shifts he breaks into the hotel room of a drunken misogynist fare a finance bro to teach him and his buddies a lesson between the train scene and the lyft driving the equalizer 2 begins with a lot of momentum it dissipates as attention shifts to washingtons former spy colleagues confrontations with them in a suburban driveway and at a beach house in a deserted seaside town during a hurricane indicate movement away from the working class toward the kind of real estate exintelligence agents are more likely to inhabit fuqua stages it all with a kind of anthony mann intensity and attention to space but the equalizer 2 will probably end up being the only action movie to ever leave me wanting more scenes of the protagonist working for a rideshare app or at least the only one since jamie foxx invented uber in collateral will ben foster a veteran with ptsd and his adolescent daughter tom thomasin mckenzie live hardcore off the grid in a state forest in the pacific northwest after yuppie hikers discover their leanto and report them to the rangers will and tom are relocated to a tree farm in an isolated community with a church and a school there tom is exposed for the first time to people her own age she makes contact with a dude who looks like a refugee from a gus van sant film or a guy from a grunge band like the screaming trees a name that makes sense in this context tom wants to join 4h with him so she can learn to take care of animals will however cannot abide the confinement of the small house he and his daughter have been assigned nor can he tolerate the warbattle noise of the helicopters that haul away trees to be sold at christmastime we can still think our own thoughts he tells tom when they move in but the conformity of the simple life blots out thought for him a man for whom peace of mind is impossible in human society debra graniks leave no trace is the directors belated return to feature filmmaking after winters bone in 2010 like captain fantastic from a couple of years ago but with much more art grace and a sense of actual danger  perhaps because it is set among the homeless perhaps because it was made by a woman  leave no trace restates the male genx narrative of protecting children from the outside world and their eventual reintegration into it for fosters will there is no redemption unlike viggo mortensens character in captain fantastic will is a permanent exile who turns his back on the world too damaged to change despite the chances offered him foster plays him somber and unlikable in a performance of confusion and quiet selfrighteousness that leads him to expose his daughter to frostbite rides from truckers and housebreaking when tom finally abandons him he slinks back into the woods a hermit turning his back on the film hes in granik pulls away to a godseye view of this figure as he disappears the enigmatic american filmmaker rob tregenzas last feature film before gavagai came out twenty years ago as in leave no trace in gavagai a man andreas lust goes into the woods alone unfriendly and embittered he arrives in a remote norwegian town and hires a driver mikkel gaup to take him farther north for reasons he doesnt explain this is not a road film in which two men wax philosophical and overcome their differences on a journey through the european countryside like in those trip movies and tv shows with steve coogan and rob brydon from acclaimed director michael winterbottom tregenza shoots quiet people in long takes with complicated camera moves the two men barely speak and never quite bond tregenza is not sketching the wistful unhappiness of the moneyed creative class so much as staring into the divide between souls the mans journey comes to an end short of his destination in the rain on a cliff overlooking an expanse of forest he rips up his late wifes translations of the norwegian writer tarjei vesaas and flings them into the wind his anger destructive and futile seems to compound his wifes death by destroying whats left of her work gavagai is a film about the impossibility of closure and the endlessness of grief the title comes from the analytic philosopher w v quines word and object in which quine invents the word gavagai to use as an example of thatwhichisuntranslatable tregenza and his coscenarist kirk kjeldsen have translated it seems the poems of vesaas into mood and atmosphere the poems haunt gavagai in this confrontation with the void sometimes they appear in the form of the mans wife a ghost who shows up as an awkward memoryintranslation in the end the man and the film are both wise to abandon this image and return to life around a fire at dusk this belgian genre film a delirious unpleasant mashup of a poliziottesco and a spaghetti western shot in corsica is as violent as it is arty a heistgonewrong set in and around a villa and a cave it features a cast of treacherous criminal zeroes bohemians and cops and it doesnt let up on the violence or the artiness while adapting jeanpatrick manchette novels for the screen is as inevitable as it is desirable this one seems to exist only as a music video for ennio morricones score as a music video its a shocker but too long as a feature film its pointless and repetitive especially the squeakingleatherpants sound effect that recurs over and over again manchettes novels are latterday séries noires fastpaced destructive critiques of capitalism from the era of urban terrorism in europe few of their characters survive in let the corpses tan none do and the grimness is not ironic or critical just maggoty the film does give off that im on drugs feel specifically of bad speed but its so laborintensive that like many a trip it should have ended a long time ago elina löwensohns presence as a witchy bisexual and oftennude painter is almost as mysterious as morricones contract must have been i hope löwensohn made money because busybee deconstructionists with manyitemed shot lists like codirectors hélène cattet and bruno forzani should pay their actors by the frame the cinema is moving in all directions as endless new content crams itself into every available space this is leading to new kinds of international crossborder weirdness as films more than ever are shot wherever the money is its not just belgians in corsica imitating italians or brooklyn playing colorado or north carolina as california or toronto and vancouver as anywhere else now in mandy we get belgium as both the pacific northwest and the bowels of hell starring nicolas cage emerging from the same crosscontaminated genre swamp as let the corpses tan mandy achieves its goals with blunter and larger instruments which is all the better because where corpses fails mandy succeeds if corpses was a music video mandy is a whole doommetal opera in poisonous technicolor with an album cover depicting a landscape of magenta indigo and goldenyellow ruins the film is like that bell witch album that only has one ninetyminutelong track it opens with king crimsons starless on the sound track playing before a clip from a ronald reagan speech about spiritual awakening its 1983 and cage a lumberjack lives in the woods with his girlfriend andrea riseborough a weirdfiction fan who works in a tiny country grocery store and speaks like patti smith reading the poem at the beginning of the revenge of vera gemini  a british persons version of unaffected americanness riseboroughs slight new jersey inflection points to where mandy lets in real life one of the films principle pleasures is that for all its splashymorose color schemes and arty dissolves its death cult maintains the feeling of unemployed oafs from neptune new jersey worshipping satan in ramapo mountain state forest the film is pure acid trip with a macaroniandcheese commercial thrown in tv commercials are the worst thing to see on hallucinogenic drugs cage howls in pain and screams in despair breaking out in occasional intelligibility only to say things like dont be negative by the end as a grimy wounded cage stands with a chain saw in front of a burning car and still hasnt avenged his girlfriend or saved anyone else from the drugaddicted demonsprivatepress recording artists it becomes obvious what director panos cosmatos has delivered here a parody of the heros journey on par with kanye wests use of that phrase in the oval office while describing donald trump to himself panos cosmatos knows a lot of things about making movies including that you show the burning cars and yet hes no lee changdong who fails to fully reveal a burning porsche thats an important plot point in his new film lee does show donald trump however on a tv in the protagonists apartment using the original cheddar goblin to add to the sense of unease in this unique serialkiller mystery and unlike let the corpses tan burning raises actual questions about money and its effects on peoples lives burning like psycho and lavventura starts off as a film about a woman haemi jeon jongseo who appears to be its subject and star while working her job hawking cell phone accessories in a miniskirt she reconnects with jongsu yoo ahin a povertystricken aspiring writer she knew in high school after they hook up she leaves for a solo trip to africa and returns with a new friend ben played by the american actor steven yeun in a subtle nuanced performance that shifts between friendlyclassy and im a secret arsonist ben is a young member of gangnams idle class and neither haemi nor jongsu fit in there after haemi begins to date ben she disappears again jongsu quizzes ben about her absence and slowly comes to realize something isnt quite right with this slick fashionable dude who starts reading faulkner because jongsu mentioned him one of the films slyest condemnations of richperson poaching burning refuses to reveal what actually happened to haemi or what kind of person ben really is if he is any type at all which leaves jongsu in a terrifying moral limbo all three of the films main characters are dispensed with by lee in this unsentimental movie that shows human connection as fragile and masked when the friends are unequal haemi dismissed from the film the earliest and seemingly with ease in a way gets off the easiest of these characters because theres no way to know what happened to her shes kooky and a searcher but also just an innocent victim but of what with the men its all too clear cinephiles in new york have noted the difference between how 2018 began and how it is ending in january it was possible to see a movie a day in almost any theater for 999 a month using moviepass it was possible to stream thousands of classic and foreign films at home through filmstruck for about 8 a month now out of the blue and with little explanation but as the result of its monopolistic deal with att time warner has shut down filmstruck moviepass still exists but barely for a while it managed to do something that seemed impossible it changed theatrical exhibition for the better now it has more predictably than the shuttering of filmstruck it must be said become some new kind of con in which only the most mediocre and longestrunning movies are available to see and only three a month suddenly we are plunged into a world of 16 movies at theaters in a city with no video stores the cancellation of both services at this point seems like the end of the long tail the blockbuster model has reasserted itself and as usual seeks to muscle everything else out of the way at the height of corporate capitalism you pay full price for bad movies improperly projected in ugly theaters whose business is selling large sodas at a 1000 percent markup if you want to watch a movie at home theres netflix now mostly a streaming television service or amazon its all an insult to cinephiles and to film history going mass means living in the moment and throwing away what came before the moment is crap to rub it in the large theatrical chains have implemented reserved seating policies which by slowing down ticket buying at the box office herd filmgoers into making electronic purchases for which they have to pay an additional fee reserved seats are antithetical to moviegoing which traditionally and democratically has been first come first served you could move to a different seat if a weirdo or anybody was sitting too close this new nonegalitarian system is fancy and inappropriate it takes too long and it huddles people together lets just go to the opera at this point instead of seeing the girl in the spiders web pinned in place next to someone texting wyd meanwhile the ads shown before movies have gotten more aggressive about copping to how terrible and disgusting their products are the one for diet coke with netflix actress gillian jacobs is a masterpiece of the passiveaggressive comeon look jacobs begins like a pundit on a tv news show heres the thing about diet coke life is short as well as nasty and brutish next she implores people who want to live in yurts to yurt it up and just do you yurt dwellers may not drink diet coke but they still have rights she concludes with a simple confession diet coke because i can has freedom of choice ever seemed less appealing at least that particular ad wasnt made by a film student the worst most dystopian coke ads shown in theaters  each one a little nightmare from a society that has gone full clockwork orange  are now also promos for higher education they are contests that inculcate their lucky filmstudent winners into a world of metashilling where the theatrical experience is reconfigured as an excuse to slurp coke under dim lights doing that is so satisfying that the actors onscreen envy the soda guzzlers in their cushy seats with cup holders and reach out to grab their giant sodas this kind of audience flattery is a form of permission to use cell phones while the movie is on if the actors are just dorks like you who need a coke so bad there isnt any need to pay attention to them when i went to see crazy rich asians my date and i sat next to three other couples in a row with eight seats the young women in the other couples texted throughout the movie which was sold as an important cultural event while their boyfriends careful not to mess up a date sat passively and stared at the screen as if their girlfriends were watching the movie with them instead of paying attention to other people who werent there i saw an ingmar bergman film at the museum of modern art recently where i was seated one row over from a family of four the father texted throughout the first half hour of the movie impervious to the nearby moma regulars hissing at him to stop when they began turning around jabbing their fingers in his face and threatening to take his phone he stood up grabbed his childrens hands and marched out of the theater in a huff his wife trailing behind somehow he had been wronged similarly at the new york film festival screening of burning a man seated a couple of rows ahead of me texted on and off for the first twenty minutes of the film until someone got an usher to shine a flashlight in his face and threaten to remove him i understand why the texters went to see crazy rich asians i do not understand what they were doing at moma and the new york film festival its true that excellent new theaters that show good movies have opened and are opening in new york city they sell discount cards and anyway there are many different ways to see movies some of them legal without filmstruck and moviepass but cash outlays for those discount cards are not small and the prices without them are steep and when venom came out last month to universal pans and no human being who liked it could be found anywhere it still cleaned up at the box office its still playing i looked just now and it has passed 200 million in ticket sales it must be a great movie for texting a journey to the end of the night set in los angeles like faces wobble palace is an antiromcom of debasement unlike faces its characters are petulant underemployed young whiners instead of confused middleclass middleaged drunks times have changed in los angeles no longer cassavetess city of nice houses with big dining rooms wobble palace reveals la living as downscale and codependent even in open relationships scrolling text messages take up part of the frame sometimes and add to wobble palaces mood of smarmy irritation one gets used to them onscreen where they are better than in the audience but not to the artificial clickclick sound of the keys put your shit on silent the halloween night 2016 setting aids the film as writerdirectorstar eugene kotlyarenko goes full herzogs nosferatu as his costume choice for the scenes before the final breakup its more flattering than the fat skrillex look he is accused of sporting earlier costar and cowriter dasha nekrasova also gets to say things like were gonna have our first female president soon in her distinctive worldweary drone of postironic predisappointment like vivas bored drawl in the late 1960s warhol films and in vardas laset lions love nekrasovas voice is the voice of a generation  in tone at least it is so distinctive i wish she would record the service interruption announcements on the subway so that the true sound of the stalled and waiting would come through the speakers no drama is posted as rule no 1 for the servers at the hootersesque restaurant in stripmall texas where support the girls takes place andrew bujalski highlights his films commitment to that as a concept even as star regina hall as the restaurants manager admits that banning drama is impossible with her halfdressed staff of twentysomething women but when they get too provocative she reminds them we are mainstream we are mainstream drama is mainstream porn is not mumblecore isnt either so bujalski who is now one of the best directors of actors in american filmmaking has designed this unique lowkey film as a vehicle for hall the excellent actress from the think like a man and scary movie movies who was overshadowed by the discovery of tiffany haddish in girls trip while the film descends into a bartop riot and ends with women drinking and screaming in rage and frustration on a roof it is men who are more likely to violate the no drama rule the restaurant owner james le gros for instance subjects a captive hall to his pointless fury as they speed in his truck with boat attached to pursue another driver who has annoyed him on the road when hall and her staff move over to a corporate chain restaurant called man cave an hr manager played with polished friendliness by brooklyn decker reveals the true drama of our time weve built this superwellthoughtout culture of respect she explains and we have a whole team of attorneys who are paid a crazy amount to make sure we lay that out clearly like the manager she plays hall is a team player to the end im not sure the ensemble cast doesnt overshadow her lea delaria as bobo a dyke regular at the bar steals every scene shes in shayna mchayle aka the brooklyn rapper junglepussy draws attention away from everybody else with nothing more than baleful stares and a selfcontained sickofitall attitude if someone put mchayle and dasha nekrasova in a movie they would become a bored indie richard pryor and gene wilder at least for south by southwest and bushwick if not the mainstream ron rices last film unfinished at the time of his too early death is an essential document of bohemian new york city in 1963 as it was lived and thrashed in cheap apartments and on the streets taylor mead its star the ultimate weird bohohipster of the second half of the 20th century finished a final cut of the queen of sheba meets the atom man in 1981 after having screened other versions around the world for almost two decades meads version has now been restored by anthology film archives the films blackandwhite images demonstrate what the campavantgarde nexus meant in the manhattan of andy warhol jill johnston and frank ohara the film was shot a year before sontags notes on camp was published but rices movie is a living breathing leghumping enactment more amusing friendly and connected to daily life than jack smiths flaming creatures smith one of sontags inspirations appears in the movie and almost takes over its second half from the coy shier mead and from winifred bryan the implacable overweight black woman who is the queen of sheba to meads atom man the film having established the bizarre relationship between these two mismatched oddballs cant stray too far from them no matter who piles on the queen of sheba meets the atom man should be projected twentyfour hours a day somewhere in manhattan so that before were all pushed into the sea off rockaway beach people can be reminded of the strange form of life that once lived here it turns out that selfconscious cinematic camp was not exactly invented by jack smith in new york in an unimposing suburban home in pacific palisades california jerry lewis unbeknownst to the avantgarde had begun in 1951 to shoot blackandwhite movie parodies and prewarholian color screen tests during his nights and weekends off from paramount pictures where he and dean martin were employed as the nations most popular comedy duo shown only once to friends at premiere parties at the same house where they were filmed lewiss garron productions named for his sons remained unseen by anyone else until this past october when the lewis estate and the library of congress debuted them at the museum of modern art these films which combine borscht belt humor and mad magazinestyle parody with vulgar putdowns and gay panic reveal lewis as a comic auteur and total filmmaker almost ten years before his official directorial debut the bellboy the garron movies like the queen of sheba meets the atom man also document their time and place which in this case is the sunny southern california of hollywood movie stars partying at home if you had been waiting to hear dean martin janet leigh tony curtis or shelley winters utter words like orgasm cock shit and vomit your wait was over if you made it to moma this past fall the series combined featurettes shorts and home movies from this period in which jerry lewis and america were both on the rise lewiss wellknown neuroticism and aggressiveness are less hidden and more integrated in these productions than in the freudian constructs paramount put together for him and dean or in the later work for which he was solely responsible in fact these movies present a happy jerry not the lugubrious interviewee america got to know from his films in the 1960s after he became an auteur and a philanthropist one home movie shot at a 1920sthemed jazz party in the lewis rec room is positively giddy with lewis and patti his wife and curtis and leigh doing the charleston in boaters spats and flapper outfits late into the night the films themselves present popular movies of the day in jewish versions sunset boulevard becomes fairfax avenue the story of a handsome young delivery boy curtis from a kosher deli forced to write a screenplay for a washedup star of the silent screen leigh caked in face powder in come back little shiksa martin is a doctor struggling to avoid sobriety each is like a kuchar brothers film with big stars in it too weird and offensive for tv sketch comedy an emanation from a hip demimonde that only existed in lewiss house when curtis and leigh dropped by the milton berle screen test which poses uncle miltie against a brightred backdrop as it scrutinizes his face so lewis can pepper him with rude absurd questions offscreen is more outthere than any warhol screen test id say its one of the best films of the 1950s and it clearly demonstrates lewiss way with color and his ability to capture stylized discomfort onscreen in the moma lobby between jerry lewis screenings a basketballstomached older man wearing a large newsboy cap introduced himself to me as slaps donovan he cornered me to tell me he used to be the film critic on jackie masons radio show now he had a broadway play and a reality tv series he was developing hal prince said slaps has my play on his desk but hes booked up for the next three years this play a musical takes place during the woodstock rock music festival in 1969 but doesnt use any of the songs its all new original music that slaps has written his tv show celebrity séance involves unsuspecting contestants speaking to famous dead people through the medium of slapss voice impressions which he will provide offscreen at the very moment slaps asked me in the voice of jerry lewis about getting some nookie i got a text on my phone a woman i know who works for netflix was in town for the new york film festival she was inviting me to meet her and two filmmakers for dinner at a fancy restaurant near lincoln center while slaps imitated jerry lewis and i looked at this text on my phone a brazilian artist named romero britto walked by dressed in a multicolored homemade suit and stopped to pose for photos fans of his wanted to take with him the clowns had been sent in and i was among them i couldnt go to dinner there was another jerry lewis movie in half an hour that i planned to see and besides i wasnt dressed for that kind of thing if i had gone to meet my friend and two glamorous strangers i would have become the slaps of the dinner explaining how i was a film critic that night instead i had committed myself to the bizarre and the asinine slaps exited onto 53rd street still doing his jerry lewis voice and i went and sat down in the lobby to wait for the next show a lady in a burgundy tracksuit sitting across from me pulled a container of macaroni salad out of a crinkly plastic shopping bag pried off the clear plastic lid and began eating it with a big metal soup spoon she had brought with her to the museum at least i wasnt wearing a funny hat a truer séance of dubbed voices forgotten faces and witchy art orson welless the other side of the wind brings a lost work back to life by the time of his death in 1985 welles had been working on the film for fifteen years and hadnt finished it now it arrives complete fully formed a masterpiece and a shock to the system courtesy of netflix and all the money they have to burn it is not a fragment like welless its all true or don quixote it is done never has a movie been as overwhelmed by the history of its production as this one this circus of scattered souls    a desperate venture shared by desperate men that doesnt matter anymore the desperate men and the scattered souls are now on the screen near the beginning of the film a busload of partygoers on the way to the desert house of the film director jake hannaford john huston passes a drivein theater where the huge marquee advertises two movies i eat your skin and i drink your blood fitting titles for this exposé of hollywood vampirism its filmed alternately like zabriskie point random eurotrash kenneth angerian avantgardism 1970s

partially masked by lots of naked hippie hetero sex in a steam bath in a moving car and on a back lot in hollywood abandoned and in ruins in the other side of the wind welles purposefully synthesized every film style that had come along since the late 1950s in a bid for relevance the film mocks when hannaford is accused of doing the same where hannaford crashes and burns welles succeeds with brilliance adding to the sense of tragedy surrounding the film it should have come out in its time the film swings wildly between tones and tempos blackandwhite and ultravivid color michel legrands

Dec 7 2018,neutral, wow i dont even know where to start for a series of films built preeminently on incredible action set pieces and a penchant for selfoneupmanship with tom cruise at the lead you know that mission impossible  fallout was designed from day one to be a wild ride how effective of one would it be that was really the only question its corny to say it but the series already did a couple films ago so i guess i have permission mission accomplished defying all conventional hollywood wisdom the sixth installment of this series is very well the best one yet and i say yet because at this rate i dont doubt cruise will muster up the fervor to continue these until he looks like jim phelps in his last installment why do i believe this lets dig in as this film functions as a complete extension of the last film also directed by the series first repeatdirector christopher mcquarrie we open with an extension of rogue nations interesting opening just as that film featured the mission briefing delivered to ethan hunt cruise advancing the characterization beyond the actionhero cypher of films past through an antiquated method record player this film delivers it with the churning and whirring of a gearbox reminding us of the analog nature of why we love these films among the deluge of digital playgrounds that fill cinemas on a weekly basis there is a respite in knowing that imf agent ethan hunt can always find ways to thrill us with the oomph that can only come from practical stunt work the syndicate that has been slowly building and manipulating behind the scenes globally has morphed into a new form the apostles and as the name implies there is a religious fervor to usurping the world order while gamers might connect the films title to the video game series of fallout by name alone that connection does actually work recovery of plutonium cores that are set to power three nuclear explosives is what gets the incredibly powerful and efficient machine that is this film going as trailers show solomon lane played again through chilling whispers by sean harris the villainous mastermind of the syndicate is a part of the apostles plans hunt and crew find themselves caught in the middle of incredible forces that could very easily destroy life globally and end theirs personally divulging much more will unlock the secrets that should only be revealed through viewing theres a hypnotic energy to this films pacing the sheer number of impressive action set pieces is incredible and while everyone will remember cruise climbing the burj khalifa in ghost protocol here we may very well have one of the best choreographed and edited action films of all time that film centered around that incredible sequence but here we have an almost beginningtoend steam train of pure movie magic that hits hard and doesnt stop dialogue and plot act as moments to catch our breath but even in the midst of action sequences the storytelling continues in creative ways while i am a lover of daniel craigs series of james bond films quantum of solace in particular got lost in the editing room with some of its action sequences thereby leaving audiences dazed and confused such things are never an issue here yes the camera finds itself placed in ways that just shouldnt be possible but the shots it captures always reinforce the spatial layout of everyone and everything even as it was all thrilling never was i lost in what was going on and after years of critiques in action filmmaking hopefully this film will be a lesson to all other films to come punches land here with power crashes are felt and allinall the energy runs high there are many reasons henry cavill was cast here as agent august walker a tagalong assigned to work with ethan due to cia oversight from their new director angela bassett the primary one being is that he is a beast onscreen in the expertly crafted bathroom fight scene shown heavily in trailers he seems to reload his arms and i believed it the effectiveness of this film as an action film cant be overstated and i havent even gotten to the twists and turns of the plot while this film felt less fun or funny than the last two it all happens out of necessity the stakes have never felt higher and with a larger team of people we genuinely care about i was fully wrapped up in everything happening to everybody the plot has always somehow seemed secondary in these series of films but mcquarrie in particular has elevated it to a higher priority in rogue nation and now here in my opinion he crafts his two films to be a full realization of what the series always could be even after its inconsistent start with earlier films as the marketing stills show colors seem muted here throughout but i believe it makes the colorful moments in the film like the halo jump and subsequent nightclub scene look even better as a result ive yet to talk about ilsa faust rebecca ferguson but she returns with an interesting plot thread this film delves into the themes of the greater good and personal justice in a multitude of ways and she is just one of the many ways thats all unpacked ethan hunt is given the opportunity to hone his moral code here by the situations that come and as a result he becomes a far better character overall the danger dampens the opportunities for humor as mentioned but benji simon pegg and luther ving rhames get chuckles right when we need them also worth mentioning is how this film finds great ways to incorporate plot elements from the entire series here a true first in a series that has felt so disjointed alongside that i felt genuine emotion towards the end with character interactions rooted in longrunning plot developments from earlier films that kind of emotion only comes with films connected by plot and im so glad that the series has embraced it contentwise the violence hits hard but there is nothing gratuitous to me or unnecessary everything feels real and as a result gore or death isnt glorified i was disappointed in the fbomb delivered here and considering who gives it and his other wellknown film role it felt cheap and unnecessary to me sexual content is completely a nonfactor here which is interesting in a spy film the terrorist group being named the apostles and their planned attacks on the worlds holy cities ties the film to the bible but it doesnt explicitly go any deeper than that i am authoring a geeks under grace bible study for the film and i plan to go into the themes of providence and the sanctity of life check it out once it is published overall i cannot recommend this film highly enough its satisfying on so many levels in a summer of thanos and dinosaurs its quite a testament that of all those films i think i had the strongest compulsion to rewatch this if you have even had a passing interest in any of the preceding films in the series at all you owe it to yourself to catch up to this one and experience the thrill ride it offers it is a further perfecting of what the series can deliver and kudos to cruise to continuing to find new ways to put himself into the ire of insurance companies everywhere doing things no sane person would attempt the meticulous direction from mcquarrie has me hoping that he and cruise work out a deal for him to continue directing this partnership until jumping or hanging from any high point iswell impossible with the series being this good this far into itself long live ethan hunt
Dec 7 2018,positive, it is common knowledge that tom cruise broke his ankle while shooting a scene where he jumps from roof top to roof top during a foot chase the consummate professional and filled with astounding mental fortitude cruise manage to finish the scene as planned despite the injury the broken ankle would have been the main story of the production for any other film but tom cruise is no ordinary actor and mission impossible  fallout is no ordinary film as one observes in the special features of the films bluray the broken ankle was the least of everyones concerns tom cruise was literally one wrong move away from serious harm in every single one of the stunts he performed in the film making the sense of danger in the final product even more captivating in this installment ethan hunt tom cruise and his imf team simon pegg and ving rhames find themselves battling the remnants of solomon lanes sean harris syndicate now called the apostles as they search for three stolen plutonium cores the cores are of particular interest to a mysterious individual known as john lark who intends to use the plutonium to finish the work lane started not trusting that hunts team can complete their mission the cia sends one of their top agents august walker henry cavill to ensure that the items are retrieved by any means necessary complicating matters further is the fact hunt needs lane to find lark and the plutonium while former ally isa faust rebecca ferguson is tasked with ensuring that lane is silenced once and for all one of the years best films mission impossible  fallout is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the films that came before it in the series it is an edge of your seat thrill ride that manages to top itself with each action sequence without sacrificing the story in the process christopher mcquarries direction feels especially assured this time around unlike most modern action filmmakers mcquarrie places the practical stunts at the forefront and uses special effects to enhance them rather than the other way around this allows cruise and the rest of the cast henry cavill is a great addition as the rough around the edges walker to raise the stakes in a palpable way the bluray which arrives in stores tomorrow as part of a bluraydvddigital combo pack courtesy of paramount home media entertainment is packed with special features that are just as riveting as the film itself the standout is behind the fallout which consists of seven featurettes that breakdown how every action sequence was filmed take for example top of the world that highlights just how grueling and dangerous it was to create and shoot the halo jump or rendezvous in paris in which the cast and crew discuss how paris became a key component of several action sequences including the arc de triomphe motorcycle chase
Nov 25 2018,positive, mission impossible fallout is the type of film that invites viewers into the action from an epic skydiving scene to a helicopter chase the camera focuses in on its main actors  especially tom cruise  as they complete incredible stunts right in front of us cruise performed many of his characters stunts himself proving himself to be an undeniably ambitious action star and showing audiences what great action sequences can look like this is one of the many things that makes director christopher mcquarries new film stand out despite fallout serving as the sixth entry in the longrunning cinematic franchise the film feels like a unique feat for fans of the franchise many of the key elements of those stories return here there are plenty of deceptions here  the masks return in a big way alongside a few smart twists and welcome surprises but theres also some great character arcs here as well that raise the emotional stakes in this installment a failed mission leads to a horrific predicament a group of terrorists aligned with the imprisoned solomon lane sean harris steal a shipment of plutonium lane who served as the head of the terrorist organization known as the syndicate in mission impossible rogue nation returns to the forefront here as his allies take on hunts team in order to recover the plutonium hunts team must engineer a trade with an enigmatic broker known as the white widow vanessa kirby the storyline sets up intricate action sequences pitting hunt and allies such as cia operative august walker henry cavill against lanes criminal network ilsa faust rebecca ferguson returns too as an mi6 operative with her own agenda mcquarrie who directed and cowrote rogue nation returns to the helm in this new instalment and serves as the writer and director once again as oscar winner for penning the usual suspects screenplay mcquarrie knows how to keep a complicated script tight and does so here the dialogue is set up nicely with short early scenes establishing the story quickly without losing the films energetic pace when it comes to the action mcquarrie keeps his camera focused on the action itself instead of pulling the camera back he leans the camera in  keeping the intensity high while showing the action and his actors up close the script itself offers plenty of strong dialogue with simon pegg offering up some great oneliners once again as benji dunn and ving rhames offering a more subtle turn as luther stickell beyond that theres an emotional importance to the proceedings with a delicate storyline featuring julia meadehunt michelle monaghan and faust julia hunts wife was absent in the last installment so its great to see her return as an important supporting figure here the status of hunts relationship with her and hunts growing bond with faust add a depth to these characters and to their overall arcs it also ties this newest installment nicely together with some of the earlier films this isnt a franchise where each of the installments stands alone unlike many of the james bond pictures for instance the newer films here add layers to the existing characters and build them up in each installment and thats undeniably the case here mission impossible fallout builds on the past storylines but weaves its own unique narrative it keeps this series going strong with a capable tom cruise leading the way  and showing off his incredible skills  and mcquarrie guiding this series forward featuring tremendous action sequences smart dialogue and an emotional depth this film is one of the best action movies of the year
Nov 16 2018,positive, i love the rubber masks ripped off to reveal someone else entirely underneath though i was also secretly hoping they would keep ripping mask after mask off each other until all that was left was a collection of tiny pinhead people the masks also added a scooby doo ambience and faced with a perfectly innocent character at the end i was fully expecting someone to rip off the guys face and the revealed villain to declare he wouldve gotten away with it if it wasnt for those pesky kids i say kids the team cruise as ethan hunt ving rhames as luther simon pegg as benji are all getting on a bit cruise is after all 56 now that other american trademark the giant redwood is only 3444 years older it would be understandable if he occasionally felt a little creaky jumping out of a window or let out an involuntary aaahhh or ooohhh as he manauvered his way into the pilots seat of an inflight helicopter after climbing up a long swinging rope midair but he keeps going driving the action forward mission impossible fallout is relentless its action scenes going on longer than you think possible while still being knucklechewingly exciting cruise is its beating heart  amiably taking the piss out of himself while throwing himself into literally deathdefying stunts ethan hunt is ageing physically knackered and emotionally weary its actually a rather moving portrayal even the potential sortof love triangle between hunt isla faust rebecca ferguson and hunts exwife julia michelle monaghan doesnt go beyond the odd intake of breath and sad glance as everyones so very nice and probably a bit tired cruise has been around for so long that ive adored him then gone off him then adored him again about 15 times i even remember him in risky business the film that sent sales of tooth veneers and london underground season tickets rocketing i might as well also admit that to me alec baldwin will always be the blueeyed sexpot from knots landing not only is the action believably human in a truly unbelievable way obviously and fallible  its also funny theres a terrific extended chase sequence with hunt running across the london skyline  along the tops of buildings through offices and sliding down tiled roofs  while benji directing him left right left right in his pursuit from the ground doesnt realise hes up in the air its only when ethan pauses and benji questions it  presumably he thought ethan was waiting for a pelican crossing to turn green  and ethan barks hes waiting to jump out of a window that he twigs the plot as far as i could understand before it got too muddy centres on some missing containers of plutonium which hunt previously failed to rescue after choosing the lives of his team instead and if thats not on the next philosophy alevel paper in a discussion of rule utilitarianism then it should be this idea that hunt feels himself forced to continue his work because he can is a big theme here and as near as it gets to real thoughtfulness not so much arrogance as the belief that hes personally letting down individuals and the world if chooses a quiet life and despite its many threads director christopher mcquarrie has ensured you dont have to have seen the series to enjoy this one theres quite a lot of explanation even if i didnt always understand it all the unremitting action needs no prior knowledge and the warm relationships among his team while they may have been built up during previous films are easy to appreciate and enjoy the plutonium search takes in first the white widow vanessa kirby a fake philanthropist and genuine arms dealer if hunt can spring imprisoned american agent turned anarchist solomon lane sean harris who is about to be transported across paris in a prison van he can then swap him for the plutonium via her contacts or not swap him as of course he and lane have history but get the plutonium back anyway oh and hunt is pretending to be john lark another terrorist and later hes framed to make the cia think he really is lark gone rogue isla faust is in paris too just to add to the merry reunions keeping an eye on hunt for the cia is august walker henry cavill perfectly cast he spends the first half of the film always slightly behind hunt and the second half slightly in front hes ruthless and extremely snarky ive just checked my cinema notes and i actually wrote walker is a cocky bugger so you can rest assured that was my first impression hes funny and fit during that alreadyfamous restroom fight scene between him hunt and he who may or may not be lark liang yang as sparkly glass shatters silver pipes are ripped from walls and the pristine shinywhite cubicles become drenched in blood theres a puppyish keenness too hope is not a strategy walker says pompously to which ilsa replies dryly you must be new a feature of fallout is how much of the action is not just seatofpants but madeonthehoof as planning goes out of the window and instinct and everreducing options take precedence im not going to lie i rather liked lane until i discovered hed gassed whole villages and shot down a passenger plane to kill one person almost as much as i liked moustachioed walker in victorian gentleman about to challenge one to a duel mode even though the madeyed lane has terrible things planned for us because the greater the suffering the greater the peace i do love movie villains with big ideas and big speeches to match i know i moan about long films but dont cut them if doing so means chopping their narcissistic impassioned world annihilationjustifying gibberish eventually even the most megalomaniacal of them mentions the compromised nature of most governments and i start thinking hmm a stopped clock is right twice a day the terrible things include two nuclear weapons linked together which can only be deffused wait for it once the countdown has started and which are hidden in a medical outpost at the base of a huge and rocky glacier in kashmir by a water source which supplies some of the most populous nations on earth and someone has gone off in a helicopter with the detonator which needs to be switched off but luckily theres another helicopter just taking off too and a blackclad hero in pursuit

Nov 3 2018,positive, theres a new installment of the mission impossible franchise on the block but by now these films might best be referred to by their birth name tom cruise hangs off of things you may be aware by now that there will be stunts and tom cruise will be risking his life for your enjoyment likely in the air somehow mission impossible  fallout provides him with plentiful airborne opportunities this time cruises ethan hunt deals with the immediate ramifications of rogue nations syndicate the global crime organization led by the now captured solomon lane the dismantling has led to the apostles an offshoot terrorist organization that hunt must prevent from stealing plutonium to be used for multiple nuclear weapons set for simultaneous explosion returning for the laughs are his cohorts played by ving rhames and simon pegg and a new mustachioed face henry cavill as a somewhat unwilling cia agent assigned to their unit to also keep a close eye on hunt rebecca fergusons british agent ilsa faust returns with a mission of her own that may or may not stand in opposition to hunts what unfolds is a traditional actioner where our hero battles protecting loved ones versus acting towards the greater good this mission is partly of hunts own making having bungled obtaining the plutonium in the opening moments in order to save rhames luther but the age old this time its personal cliche plays out in delightfully exaggerated ways as fallouts villains devise umpteen scenarios that constantly put hunt in those crosshairs including revisiting the specter of hunts nowinhiding former wife played by michelle monaghan as these films begin to blur together this sequel does get some mileage by shaping its hero as one who cares as much for the individual as the many who can hold the value of both in equal measure in that regard ethan hunt has finally begun to escape being defined solely by the aura of the star that plays him its not just more personal he has more personality  and it helps make this one of the franchises more distinct entries further showing that writerdirector christopher mcquarrie has the series sharpest insights into what makes hunt a compelling character fallout ultimately creates its own kind of neckbruising extended whiplash by presenting many visceral aweinspiring acts of daring that arent shot or edited all that well despite their invigorating audacity by comparison to earlier efforts any digital tinkering is also far more obvious and slightly dampens the impact comparisons to roller coasters are commonplace in summer movie season but this is a movie that actually beats the shit out of you like the creakiest ride in the amusement park and yet the film is burdensomely overlong further dulling its thrill this sequel presents the very best and the worst about this franchise in one long dose one that is laborous to take no matter how much fun it generates thankfully ethan hunt has gone a little soft to balance the hard blows tom cruise is a cult leader who poisoned his children against their mother and is complicit in crimes and abuse coverups i find him repellent and cant stand the sight of him i know people love this franchise but i cant abide hes so gross and id just hate the experience too much like i was with kevin spacey who i hadnt watched anything of for a solid decade until baby driver which i again couldnt stand him in the film stays pretty grounded not just because most of these things were done practically but also the films shooting style it has a very unique look for a modern day hollywood blockbuster with its glowing highlights and pronounced film grain
Nov 1 2018,positive, i have a confession to make theres this thing that happens to people who review movies on any kind of quasiprofessional circuit a kind of numbing of the enthusiasm gland by proxy of the inability to overlook a films shortcomings the more movies one takes in the more unavoidable it is to not diagnose lazy writing poor story structure bland acting choppy vfx the collection of pratfalls these xxl turn your brain off tentpole films tend to suffer when you see 200 movies a year the bar to dazzle becomes impossibly high what works for general audiences who catch a movie every few months often feels flat and stale for the critic  just another coat of crisp digital paint lazily slathered on poorly recycled narrative  because weve already seen this exact story twice this year  im not trying to be elitist quite the opposite in fact in many ways us obsessive movie watchers have inoculated ourselves to thrills weve chased the dragon so adamantly that nothing short of cinematic heroin manages to finger the dial which is to say that when a movie does manage to dazzle to amaze to alarm to make ones palms sweat and ones knuckles cocaine white to conjure one to stab a fingernail marks into ones own knees  that is a feat worth standing up and dancing for mission impossible fallout is that rare elixir for the criminally underwhelmed watching it i felt like tuco salamanca snorting the blue it kicks like a mule i expect ill be chasing that feeling like a salivating addict for the next few years at the cineplexes the final guard of a dying age of superstar tom cruise is the last action hero and never has his skill been in sharper focus if the mission impossible franchise has long been a stage for cruise to display his considerable athleticism and unwavering charisma fallout is the movie equivalent of a coup de grâce the jawdangling muscle work of american ninja warrior crossbred with the raw magnetism of a bachelorette contestant at one point cruise snaps his foot like a carrot vaulting over rooftops and limps away to make sure his team gets the shot that kind of commitment cannot be faked you cant digitally create actual pain you cant synthesize thrills on this scale if fallout is one long cinematic orgasm it sure aint faked through singleshot halo jumps to flipping and spinning in an actual helicopter cgi be damned cruise gives his body and soul over to ethan hunts deathdefying shenanigans putting himself in the pilot seat on every incredibly dangerous stunt asked of him and that work shows fallout is intensity purified by extension of cruises unadulterated commitment like hunt for his mission cruise is quite literally willing to die for these movies the postcolon fallout part of the title applies in two ways on the one hand this is the first proper sequel for the now 22year old series with events characters plotlines and even the villain the snaketongued sean harris now with a fiery scraggle of disheveled hair directly entangled with 2015s rogue nation mission impossible has long been a series built on reinvention  the constant changing of the creative guard is part and parcel of why each entry feels so wildly diverse and born anew the injection of fresh talent has proved critical lifeblood for the series  and allows for each installment to be so stylistically dissimilar  but in maintaining the same director christopher mcquarrie  a move i was admittedly initially suspect of  mission impossible has never reached such impossible heights  mcquarries takes the  notion of making a direct sequel to a long running franchise  a la 007s notsosuccessful quantum of solace   and uses it to blow everything up to the nth degree the set pieces are bigger longer more fulfilling and always tethered to a pertinent emotional stake if brad birds unbelievably entertaining ghost protocol felt like a benchmark for highflying actioncircus antics  and mi3 tied ethans emotional cycles and life outside the job into the proceedings mission impossible fallout harangues the whole kit and caboodle into one nonstop rollercoaster of inyourface set pieces and genuine emotional payoff  tipping his hat to earlier franchise watermarks mcquarrie homages by recreating and perfecting theres a bite of nostalgia cheese for every mission impossible fan in the audience casual or hardcore alike with a spread of sequences that mimic that whence came before theres a play on the duplicitous opening interrogation of the first mission impossible a benjinavigated parkour sprint from mi3 the highspeed motorcycle races of mi2 and rogue nation a callback to max even hunts skill for cliffface free climbing makes an appearance fallout plays like an updated greatest hits album whose remixing transcends the original tracks its a goddamn action masterpiece  on the other side of the spectrum fallout is about choice specifically the choice to save one life at the expense of the many the fallout of an early decision launches the plot of this sixth mission forcing hunt and his team to play catch up always a step behind relying on hope and chance and willing to risk everything to save not just the world but each other ethan hunt grapples with the idea of sacrifice at many a critical junction and mcquarrie manages to further complicate a oncenotsowelldefined character by asking what he is willing to sacrifice for the greater good this makes for a darker entry  one superenhanced by rob hardys artful picturesque cinematography and lorne balfes spectacularly riveting score  one that confidently puts character development and action spectacle on the same footing  here hunt is joined by imf mainstays luther ving rhames and benji simon pegg to recover three plutonium cores in imprisoned anarchist solomon lanes harris absence the former syndicate has collapsed and transmogrified into rogue operators calling themselves the apostles with the help of recent allyplatonic love interest isla faust rebecca ferguson absolutely killing it again and under the watchful eye of sinewy handler walker henry cavill and his sex mustache both welcome additions hunt and his team are tasked with recovering these weapons of mass destruction before the new world order is aggressively dismantled  as is often the case in these kinds of movies the plot is secondary even mad max fury road rightfully hailed as one of the few great action movies of the generation was essentially a story about a guy and a girl driving into the desert and then driving back what makes an action movie soar is the worldbuilding the characters the sense of adventure and equally important ballstothewalls practical effects cgi may have made the impossible possible but stripping that back returns gravity to the proceedings these punches connect these falls have weight the fallout is real so too is fallout one of the greatest action movies of the 21st century when not plugging away at his computer matt can be found holed up in

Nov 1 2018,positive, his latest film mission impossible  fallout cements cruise as the last true movie star in capital letters someone whose talent and charisma transcends box office success critical acclaim and award season notoriety cruise is a generational talent that has defined true stardom that collaboration between cinema and celebrity people only talk about in past tense terms referencing marlon brando marilyn monroe or humphrey bogart theres nothing revolutionary about the plot which follows the same basic format as the classic television show of the same name upon which it is based ethan hunt and his team of impossible mission force imf agents must stop a psychopathic arms dealer from obtaining a macguffin and causing international catastrophes this time the macguffin is a case of three plutonium balls intended for trade to a vigilante deadset on detonating nuclear weapons for maximum global conflict theres about 10 minutes at the outset of the film that orients the audience and establishes the most clear emotional stakes in the history of the franchise then writerdirector christopher mcquarrie cranks the dial to 100 and sets cruise loose for the next two hours in the most dazzling thrill ride youre likely to see this year in a world where overreliance on computergenerated images have made the outrageous seem matteroffact what cruise does in his sixth turn as hunt feels almost too possible given how easy movie magicians at a desk could make it look and yet fallout sees tom cruise movie star literally jump out of airplanes 25000 feet in the air and choreograph a midair rescue that works like a stunning dance of fear and tension cruise spends months learning to fly  and then actually piloting  helicopters in dazzling dogfight sequences incredibly this doesnt feel authentic in the moment on a first viewing the cinematic precision and practical stunt work at play in fallout reveal itself in staggering fashion on a second third or fourth trip to theaters because everything audiences see is really happening the hesitations we see on cruises face are genuine we can find ourselves churning our minds alongside him during these moments of peril it certainly doesnt hurt to have a talented and diverse supporting cast including a stoically serious ving rhames relatable and hilarious simon pegg and alluring rebecca ferguson to pair with cruise while angela bassett and alec baldwin provide sizable resistance and gravitas mcquarrie helps carry the weight by stepping up considerably in the directors chair taking lessons learned from his last outing in rogue nationand pairing it with real stakes moment to moment youd find in the more grounded jason bourne franchise or the recent james bond films the thing that truly sets mission impossible  fallout apart from your average action film is its unwavering commitment to relentless dynamic fun cruise and mcquarrie rev the engines from moment one and take off on the cinematic autobahn though a trip down memory lane watching the prior films of the franchise especially the first third and fifth will help inform viewers you dont have to know a lot going in to enjoy the heck out of fallout
Oct 31 2018,positive, the great thing about the mission impossible series is well theres a lot of great things the films are always pretty whacky and retain a rather glorious silliness that keeps it from ever feeling like a james bond clone tom cruise is its lead star a versatile charismatic stupidly courageous actor who is willing to go that extra mile or in fallouts case an extra three miles in the air for a reallife halo jump but its whole motto was that each film would have a different director so every entry felt unique the very first was strengthened by the precision of brian de palmas directing john woo helmed the second weakest film extending the running time from around 45 to 120 minutes in slomo shots alone a relative feature film rookie by the name of jj abrams took charge on mi iii an exhilarating recharge for the audience which also featured the franchises still best villain portrayed by the late philip seymour hoffman master of iron giants and all things incredible brad bird was the lead on ghost protocol which was praised immensely upon release then christopher mcquarrie was brought in for the fifth entry rogue nation which again was given high praise for the quality of the script and inventiveness of the sequences but for fallout theres been a change of policy mcquarrie was brought back and working alongside cruise very closely they wanted to create a followup which still felt unique from the rest what they have done is nothing short of extraordinary this gloriously crafted sixquel is better pretty much in every way from its predecessors after a mission gone wrong ethan hunt cruise and his reliable imf allies must chase down missing plutonium before the world is destroyed hunts decisions put him in the warpath of cia handyman walker henry cavill and put him on a course back to an old nemesis solomon lane sean harris the stakes are very high indeed here but unlike the inevitability of success that ran through rogue nation fallout makes very clear early on that missions dont always go the imfs way narratively overall theres not a lot of new ground being treaded on its a classic end of the world plot typical of the series but mcquarrie also returning as writer infuses more deception double crosses and twists into the several eventful moments managing to make a familiar plot feel urgent cruise is on fantastically intense form taking the light and charm youd typically expect of ethan hunt but infusing it with a desperation quite unlike what were used to the opening scene establishes the neverending worry which possesses his daytoday struggles showing us precisely where our leading man is at and how it will affect his actions in the rest of the film and it definitely shows  theres a brutality in play here uncommon of the seemingly unbreathable morality of hunt killing people in an instant without hesitation or remorse but with good reason at heart it also has to be said cruise will go down in history as a movie legend and this could be described as his opus the bravery and creativity on show here is astonishing with the halo jump a london pursuit and the muchtalked about helicopter sequence showcasing his endless skillset  the full ensemble give their absolute all too with ving rhames simon pegg and rebecca ferguson returning with their full arsenal of skills employing the heart where its required but working together as a magnetic force in the most suspenseful moments cavill makes for an intimidating forceful brute of a villain a figure who is mostly a match for cruises hunt his intentions are a little predictable removing some of the surprise later on but the action and script is so well executed that these mild gripes can be forgiven sean harris returns as the nefarious ghoulish lane from rogue nation and build upon his creepy personality well in this entry sensibly not forced upon the audience too much  particularly so in lanes entrance the music will strike those goosebumps lorne balfes score can be a little heavy on the bigchord indulgence but theres definite touches of zimmer in there tapping into the pulseracing capabilities of the film and going that one step further with much relistening value  the direction is simply sublime mcquarries impressively practical vision makes for some of the most mindblowingly realised sequences since mad max fury road the aforementioned helicopter sequence is a feat of filmmaking to which there isnt an appropriate word i could use that wouldnt be classed as professional the bar has now been set very very high for practical setpieces the competency mcquarrie shows here is magnificent this is one of the cleanest looking most polished action movies around with a slight grainy feel in some moments that give this a classicinthemaking feel the camera work is smoothly handled throughout and given a beautiful spark through the cinematography of rob hardy who elevates this entry to a more technically brilliant level  this is cruise and mcquarries masterpiece a breathtaking spectacle and fluid thrill ride that doubles down on the espionage elements sometimes lost in the films but retains the nonstop velocity required and then some the producing pair have aimed for something greater than a passable summer blockbuster here simply it aims for greatness and attains perfection even through its imperfection theres too much of the old mi trope of thats exactly what he wants us to do or something along those lines but the fact theres still touches of that gleeful silliness present in an otherwise seriously produced blockbuster means the heart and soul of the franchise is very much beating
Oct 31 2018,positive,the red herrings are all better than the real answers and thats a problem
Oct 30 2018,positive,the laws of movie gravity arent supposed to work like this but here we are twentytwo years in six movies deep and we have not only a franchise best but a highwater mark for the entire genre
Oct 29 2018,positive, we regret to inform you that james bond has been official canceled until further notice the iconic spy that dominated the action genre for 50 years as the height of espionageinspired spectacle has been lapped by tom cruises ethan hunt the superspy of the mission impossible films its been trending this way for a little while mission impossible  ghost protocol brought the series to dazzling new heights only to ramp up further with rogue nation all the while bond flicks were stuck in a cycle of hit or miss movies now with mission impossible  fallout its undeniable the spy genre is now owned outright by tom cruise and writerdirector christopher mcquarrie as fallout delivers everything one could want from a globetrotting actionpacked adventure the stunts the scenery the escalating suspense swell into a stunning spectacle unmatched in modern cinema mission impossible has been angling to take the mantle of best action franchise and with the allout insanity of fallout it takes that mantle obliterating all of its competition along the way fallout is a rarity in the mi series as its a direct sequel to the events of rogue nation the nefarious solomon lane sean harris has been captured but his army of rogue agents across the world carry on his work under the name of the apostles the apostles want to secure plutonium to craft three atomic bombs that they plan to detonate in hopes of destroying the modern world order presented with the mission that he chose to accept ethan hunt and his reliable team including luther ving rhames and benji simon pegg venture around the world in search of the highly in demand plutonium however one slip up has the cia not trusting the imf team and cia director erica sloan angela bassett installs her agent august walker henry cavil alongside hunt on his covert mission in paris by the sixth film in the series ethan hunt knows his way around the world of international espionage meaning that he only truly trusts those who have been longtime members of his team when the mission has him posing an international to infiltrate a deal brokered by the white widow vanessa kirby hunt cant take anyone at their word which makes for some great moments of tension followed by unpredictable action thing get even more complicated when ilsa faust rebecca ferguson joins the picture and her mission is seemingly at odds with hunts the larger picture of the plot is incredibly simple  bad guys want nukes good guys want to stop them its the smaller character details and interactions where the film gets more complex but its easy to retain a sense of where everyone stands since ethan hunt is the film and the series moral compass and did i tell that this movie had action i mean mission impossible  fallout has so many jawdropping sequences of holy shit action cruise does the incredible halo jump from upward of 20000 feet then theres a stunning motorcycle chase through the streets of paris mcquarrie presents a keen eye for capturing action and coherently tying the racing images together so that nothing is lost in the highspeed fray a fight with cruise and cavil vs liang yang in a bathroom is absolutely wild masterfully highlighting the physicality of the actors engaged in battle and mcquarries deft staging of the melee cruise employs his trademark sprint through the streets of london at high speed jumping from rooftops and through windows in another thrilling sequence all of which culminates in the spectacular finale a thrilling helicopter chase through the indian mountains with the fate of the world on the line the scale is immense the action insane and all of it presented with astonishing precision cruise continues to go above and beyond the call of duty as an action hero and his work in fallout stands as some of his most daring works yet jackie chan is sitting back and watching tom cruises stunt work and questioning his sanity say what you will about cruises personal life choices the man is immensely dedicated to his craft and takes his work to incredible levels placing himself at risk to entertain you thats a fuckin movie star one thing that makes fallout so compelling for fans of the mission impossible series is the villainous solomon lane who is basically a funhouse mirror version of cruises ethan hunt sean harris speaks in this chilling raspy whisper that oozes emotional detachment and moral nihilism lane wants to ruin the current world order and is willing to kill millions to achieve that goal hunt on the other hand is decidedly apolitical  he doesnt oppose lanes plans because of any guiding ideological draw but simply that his plan would cause the death of untold millions i really think that mcquarrie knows that making the film too overtly political would be dangerous territory and retaining a certain apolitical idealism around hunt makes it better for the audience to embrace as a hero regardless of their standing on the political spectrum  this mind you is more a commentary on the current state of american politics than the work of tom cruise christopher mcquarrie or the entire mission impossible series which has really avoided making any strong political stances in the past nearly 24 hours after seeing mission impossible  fallout im still buzzing with a cinematic high thanks to the actionpacked work mcquarrie and cruise if possible i wouldve turned right around to watch it again many try to make movies on this scale that are so damned captivating but my god these mission impossible movies continue to pull off the impossible a dazzling highwire act of a movie mission impossible  fallout is another winner for the series with tom cruise performing some of his most amazing stunts in christopher mcquarries insanely entertaining sequel this here writing represents a symbol of sean mulvihills individuality and his belief in personal freedom hes also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls
Oct 26 2018,neutral, the cruisemeister is back in full action and full sparkly teeth mode in mission impossible fallout the latest instalment in the ethan hunt saga joining him once more is director christopher mcquarrie  following on from rogue nation and past tom efforts in jack reacher and the edge of tomorrow amongst other things after five movies in a decent franchise what could they do next to stop a worldwide disaster ethan hunt cruise and the imf team  luther rhames and benji pegg  must team up with cia assassin cavill after an initial effort to reclaim stolen plutonium from terror group the apostles is botched with the weapons now missing and in real danger of falling into the wrong hands hunt and the gang must track the plutonium down in a race against time before its too late mcquarrie cruise and co had a mission and boy did they choose to accept it by the time any franchise reaches its sixth installment theres always the real fear that things could get a bit stale andor monotonous its as if mcquarrie realised this used his loaf and decided to go the other way by fully incorporating the previous movies into ethan hunts character and story things really felt natural and the bigger story was helped by this fact the story itself is very good as is the writing acting and of course the action  some of the set pieces and stunts are mindblowingly good do yourselves a favour see it on the biggest screen possible and be blown away by one of the best action movies in decades tom cruise once more shows that he is a real action star  its well known that he performs his own stunts but its worth mentioning once more because some of the stunts in fallout are exceptional the man shows no signs of slowing down and hes as good as ever here henry cavill and moustache are big beefy handsome and imposing with pegg rhames ferguson and baldwin all excellent as well having maverick nicholas angel superman the boss baby and diamond dog on screen together was always going to be ace set piecewise this movie is sensational the muchtalkedabout halo jump over paris is breathtaking  combined with stunning imagery  and an exhilarating motorbike chase later in the movie is a fine example of how a city chase should be done the action is brutal particularly a toilet battle early in the movie and i wouldnt fancy bumping into a pissed off cavill either dop rob hardy does a fine job here as well with some beautiful imagery and scenes that further fuel the movie  not to mention lorne balfes majestic score what i particularly took joy in was the fact that the movie never felt long or bloated with its 147minute runtime the pacing was just right and theres something in every scene to keep you glued to whats going on were some of the events contrived or maybe even overblown sure but in a movie this good its forgivable delivering the best movie in a franchise thats already five efforts in a marvellous feat from mcquarrie cruise et al and fallout is more than deserving of the acclaim its big exhilarating breathtaking and simply just bloody good  accept the mission
Oct 18 2018,positive, directed by christopher mcquarriestarring tom cruise henry cavill rebecca ferguson ving rhames simon peggrunning time 2 hours 27 minutesmpaa rating pg13by sandy devito rosalie kicks dan scullythe tommy c appreciation club or tcac solemnly swears to watch and appreciate all theatrical performances by tom cruise then recap them roundtable style in this edition the moviejawn crew embarks on a bonkers adventure with our pal tommy in mission impossible  fallout sandy devito the witchqueen of darkness okay yall tommy club revival number one i still dont really understand how i missed tommy c club the last time around but im very pleased its been revived ive been watching a lot of tommy in the past two weeks because i marathond all the mi movies in prep for fallout id only ever seen the de palma one before this marathon and let me tell you they did not disappoint rogue nation is definitely the best one harnessing all the camp drama and suspense scattered throughout the previous four but i digressfallout is fucking great for one thing in particular the stunts are fucking bananas tommy jumps out of airplanes at hundreds of thousands of feet tommy uses a rope to scale a helicopter midflight only to careen it through the air trying to avoid a machine gun and crash it into another helicopter and then both helicopters crash down a fucking mountain and teeter on the precipice of a ravine tommy has a fucking incredibly choreographed fight in a bathroom that you frankly must see to believe tommy drag races cars down tiny london streets there isnt one nuclear bomb in this narrative there are two and they cant be conventionally disarmed and i bit my pinky nail off in suspense at that end sequence and the best thing about all this bonkers action is tommy did a bunch of his own stunts tommy is an animal but i will say i find it pretty ironic that mcquarrie switched out one problematic asshole with another its also not a great look to state disparaging shit about metoo when your next onscreen role is playing a sort of a spoiler horrible villain movies like this are escapism but thats a blending of reality and fantasy i could fucking do without dan scully surprising nobody who has ever heard me speak of this series or really any movie i absolutely adored fallout it may take a second viewing to be sure but this might be my new favorite mi entry a distinction which has always gone to ghost protocol if i may introduce objectivity into a purely subjective matter i believe this to be the best film in the franchise so far best and favorite are distinctions im happy to make  fight mewhile i know were here to shower love upon the smiling face of tommy c the person who emerges as the true winner of this production is writerdirector christopher mcquarrie we often dont think of him as an auteur so much as a screenwriter who made the jump to filmmaking but fallout has all but assured that he will go down as one of the great blockbuster storytellers hes certainly made one of the smartest and most exciting blockbusters of the modern era  heck of all time in an era where crisp action has been replaced with crispy action  where sequences are assembled in postproduction as opposed to being built from the ground up  its exciting to see action serve as a narrative device rather than just punctuation for the sake of adhering to genre form its doubly exciting to see action that has clarity a notion that has become foreign to so many action flicks here the visuals have a soft edge and a fluidity not often seen at the multiplex while still packing an unbelievable wallop add to that an exciting game cast with tommy i will do literally anything so long as its crazy cruise at the forefront and you simply cant lose in my humble opinion fallout is a masterpiece rosalie kicks old sport i would not go as far to say its a masterpiece however fallout is a damn fine action movie despite the run time being two hours and twentyseven minutes i found it to move swiftly there were moments that i even found my heart racing this wasnt just due to tommy cs captivating smile either dont fret tommy c charms but it is the incredibly bonkers action sequences that will leave you talking particularly the motorcycle chase tommy c has with rebecca ferguson rebecca lady you are freaking rad having stopped watching the franchise with the jj abrams mission impossible iii i am pleased to find that my timing to return is impeccable as i totally missed the renner years it was a pleasant surprise to see ving rhames still hanging in there and the simon pegg addition simon is always a pleasure to spend time with and should be in every major universe franchise thing the nerdy benji character he portrays won my heart im still astonished by all the practical effects that were used to make this movie particularly the masks thanks to angela bassett i am now able to refer to this as a halloween movie masks are great unless we are talking the mask of crispin and i love that they are such an integral part of this series a movie like this is the reason that you go to the theater you need to see it big or not at all in my eyes tommy c has now completely redeemed himself after that unspeakable movie in which he attempted to dabble as a universal monster in fallout tommy c doesnt let you down his charisma oozes off the screen and it is easy to see that he cares about us and our viewing experience tommy c gives it everything he has i have never in my life seen him run faster jump higher or deliver lines smoother im back aboard the cruise ship and am convinced that no matter what the mission is with tommy c it is always possible cuz as he so confidently reminds us throughout the flick ill figure it out sandy devito the witchqueen of darkness you know what i really love about tommy c i love the fact that he clearly loves the audiences who come to see his movies some actors and filmmakers you get the impression theyre sick of people or that they even enjoy mocking the audience or their fans or the press but tommy tommy loves the people tommys movies are always for ordinary people he makes movies because he loves to make movies he loves his audience and he wants to do whatever he can to make them happy tommys zodiac sign is cancer and cancer people love to make the people they love happy every time i watch a tommy movie fallout is no exception i get a strong feeling he wants to make me happy with his performance its clear that tommy isnt just an actor who loves his job hes also a fan of movies and thats everything when youre watching a film you can feel that radiating out from the screen hes doing all those crazy stunts for you hes smiling for you hes being intense and professing to be the storm for you dear audience tommy is a true movie star oh you know what i dont want though i dont want ethan tommy and ilsa rebecca ferguson to be lovers i dont even want them to be fuck buddies i just want them to be close friends who really respect each other and would help each other out of any kind of jam platonically i just really dont want them to fuck yall why cant ilsa just live does ethan really need to be fucking someone on the regular weve already figured out via michella monaghans jules that any kind of longterm relationship for him is gonna be super difficult due to his fucking crazy line of work cant he just have wildly romantic flings cant ilsa im glad they avoided making them kiss or some cliche shit like that and dont get me wrong i fucking love romance and sex and kissing in movies but i just dont want that for them and if he was gonna be with anyone longterm it should have been thandie newton mi 2 is fucking great yall fuck off also i said this to rosalie but after this i definitely need a break from the mi franchise i marathoned all of them and as enjoyable as they are very i need a break from the batshit stunt genre for a bit i have a watchlist thats 900 films long i need variety in my life also i would really really love to see a woman direct the next mi film i think that would be fucking awesome i think that would be totally rad if anyone can find a way to up the ante after the absolutely insane stunts in fallout its a woman dan scully in rewatching the entire series the one thing i wanted to track was how much of a character ethan hunt really is with accusations abound that tommy c is only playing himself i thought it important to try and parse out just how much of hunt is script and how much is cruise im pleased to report that hunt is most definitely a character but that this character as evidenced by another repeated phrase in fallout shares the same core values as the actor i wont let you down no sir you sure as shit have not let us down  and that really is the magic of a tommy c as sandy said his goal is to entertain us at all costs and short of a few poor role choices here and there he never disappoints even in something dumb like the mummy he can never be accused of phoning it in a distinction that few actors can say of their body of work tommy c shows the hell up no matter what and when paired with a director like mcquarrie another artist who simply refuses to give less than his all the results are magic i must wholeheartedly agree that i wish for no type of sexual relationship to bud between hunt and ilsa it just doesnt work and is totally unneeded i think fallout put an ice cap on hunts dalliance with suburban normalcy and thats where it should stay ilsa is like 20 years his junior and is way too strong of a character to be pinned down with something so passé and unnecessary and if theres one thing tommy cant really do imo its heteronormative sexiness i just dont buy it cruise and hunt read as distinctly asexual to me and thats kinda how i like it something tells me that this will be the last mi movie and i think it serves well as a series capper and really how can we possibly escalate things further send tommy c to space sure hell do it but i think im good but if we are to make another one and we were to hire a woman to direct ill throw my hat in the ring for michelle maclaren and if we really want to continue the series without tommy c which we dont i see no reason why rebecca ferguson couldnt carry the series snapping necks with her thighs through at least two more entries if the mission was to create a stunning entry in a 22year old franchise with an eye toward upping every aspect of it to oblivion well mission accomplished rosalie kicks old sport a rebecca ferguson mission spin off bring it that lady is yes and needs to be in more flicks however id like to believe that this franchise will keep going as long as tommy is breathing in and out seriously tommy c aint ever biting the dust  ed note thousands of scientologists will tell you he wont he has gotta have some kind of plan figured out hes a prepper nothing can stop this guy not even a jazzy scooter tommy

Oct 17 2018,positive,sure it was an enjoyable time at the movies but i bet if you ask me about it next week ill barely be able to remember watching it
Oct 16 2018,positive, over 20 years ago  tom cruise brought us the first chapter of a franchise nobody ever expected to last after a bit of a misstep with the sequel sorry i know it has its supporters but its an overbloated mess and disappointing box office result from the third film many assumed it may be the last wed seen of ethan hunt thankfully paramount stuck with this franchise and thank god they did with mission impossible  fallout the sixth film of this saga theyve delivered one of the greatest action films of all time and one of the best and most enjoyable movies of the year yep its that good its a genuine rarity to see a franchise improve with each chapter let alone arrive at its high point with its sixth offering but the mission impossible franchise just gets better and more ridiculously entertaining with age just like cruise the series has become one of the most reliable properties in hollywood each film has delivered more insane thrills and delicious action than its predecessor yet never feels overdone or contrite in bang for your buck terms this may be the most solid return on your admission price all year can you tell i had an outrageously fun time with this film normally with action films the plot is rather superfluous to the action but one of this franchises brilliant calling cards has been its determination to spin a narrative so overloaded with complications and exposition it makes your head spin carrying on from rogue nation its not essential to have seen the fifth instalment but it sure helps fallout begins with ethan hunt cruise and his trusty sidekick benji dunn a fabulous simon pegg attempting to gain possession of three missing plutonium orbs the dangerous spheres are in the hands of rogue mi6 agent solomon lane sean harris the former leader of the villainous group known as the syndicate after the events of the previous film left the syndicate in ruins solomon now leads the remaining members the organisation calling them his apostles who are hellbent on causing massdestruction around the globe so a new world order can rise up during the botched operation ethan is forced to choose between saving his perennial wingman luther stickell ving rhames or taking ownership of the nuclear material as has always been his one fatal character flaw ethan chooses the life of the ones he loves over the lives of potentially millions while this decision sits well with imf boss alan hunley alec baldwin it incurs the wrath of new cia director erica sloane angela bassett seeing ethans actions as wildly uncontrollable erica sends her fixer august walker a scenestealing henry cavill to accompany ethan on the mission to locate solomon alive and recover the stolen orbs more importantly august is strictly instructed to keep a close eye on ethans every move clouding his true intentions and allegiances complicating matters is the return of mi6 agent ilsa faust rebeca ferguson who has been ordered to eliminate solomon in order to restore her reputation with the british spy organisation thus burying the secret of the syndicates existence adding to the complicated mix is a mysterious dealbroker named the white widow vanessa kirby a wealthy femme fatale with a knack for black market arms dealing and a particular interest in ethan who is posing to her as an apostle named john lark as the mission to locate solomon takes ethan and his crew around the globe it becomes increasingly likely not everything is as it seems and someone is potentially playing both sides but just who is playing who and who can ethan really trust when the fate of the world is at stake if this plot sounds horrendously complex youre not wrong its a dizzying maze filled with doublecrosses hidden agendas and of course a swag of those infamous and franchisestaple uberrealistic masks sure its stakes arent exactly the most original the uh oh a terrorist group has a bunch of nukes action movie trope has been done dozens and dozens of times before but its a minor quibble in a film that gets everything else so perfectly right the zigzagging narrative continually keeps you guessing leaving the audience superbly entertained the misdirections are all perfectly and intelligently executed and theyre only elevated by the films utterly jawdropping action sequences with a pace that barely ever stops to take a breath or allow you to collect yours mission impossible  fallout is genuinely one of the best action films there has ever been director christopher mcquarries decision to essentially make the film one giant whirlwind trip around the globe is utterly magic managing to drop the action into the most dazzling of backdrops we get a madcap dash across some london rooftops featuring cruises infamous anklebreaking leap which is left untouched in the film and genuinely painful to watch a heartpounding roninesque car chase through the streets of paris a spectacularly brutal handtohand fight inside the pristine white bathroom of a paris nightclub a skydiving sequence where ethan and august literally leap right into the middle of a lightning storm and the kasmirbased well its actually new zealand finale featuring a chaotic helicopter showdown and plenty of heartracing cliffclimbing mcquarrie proved himself a master of capturing these sensational sequences in the previous film but he really ups the game here delivering set pieces unlike any weve seen in 2018 this makes anything marvel has dished up look tame by comparison particularly with mcquarrie and cruises insistence on using practical stunt work generally performed by the actor himself cruise is clearly having an absolute ball filming every single ridiculous scenario creating moments which feel completely authentic and utterly terrifying we know ethan is going to make it through each calamity but mcquarrie crafts each piece with such nailbiting tension its somehow hard not to expect the worst with every neardeath experience there were plenty of gasps in my cinema including a few elicited from yours truly every moment in mission impossible  fallout is entirely earned by mostly ignoring the use of green screens and digital wizardry the astonishing physical effects feel entirely human with genuine risk and danger presented for the audiences entertainment its what made mad max fury road such a sublime visceral experience and its the same masterstroke of genius on display here youll hear this a lot but you really do need to seek out the biggest screen possible on which to view this film its an enveloping rollercoaster that you will not want to end despite its rather mammoth running time mcquarrie keeps the film moving at such a breakneck speed you will barely notice youve been sitting in your chair for over two hours backed by an impeccable supporting cast cruise shines like always managing to completely eliminate any trace of that period of time when he became somewhat of a hollywood pariah his enthusiasm and energy for this role have not diminished one iota and hes so completely relaxed in ethans skin in a career of iconic performances its highly likely this will be the one we remember most fondly weve seen him hurl himself around like this six times now yet its still thrilling to watch him take his intensity to an entirely new level his camaraderie with pegg and rhames is onceagain beautifully genuine his rivalry with cavill is absolutely delicious and his chemistry with ferguson is downright electric its a terrific ensemble treat where every cast member is matching cruises unrelenting commitment if this is to be his swansong as ethan hunt hes going out on a high at a time when sequel and tentpole exhaustion is at an alltime high its decidedly refreshing to find a sequel hitting such an impressive home run mcquarrie has crafted a followup that takes everything thats great about this franchise and strives to push further mission impossible  fallout is everything a giant summer blockbuster should be and then some its a nonstop thrill ride that entertains like nothing else has this year thus far its the perfect blend of action and narrative that makes for such joyful cinema accept this mission and have an absolute ball
Oct 11 2018,positive, this far along the mi track we should at least subconsciously feel like rogue nations benji dunn simon pegg field status remains questionable wellaware that the declared impossibility is a ruse sure ethan hunt tom cruise enjoyment apparent and series hair rule broken again can react with the dude expression and struggle come action time but we know how things will play out fool once shame you twice me et cetera its the sixth turn now so why do we stay seated maybe its because after 2 each installment accomplishes in being finer than the one before like whiteknuckled cheese and highoctane wine jj abrams gusto makes the agents domestic life one worth saving brad birds realization of pixartinged ingenuity brings glee into the usual doomsday plot christopher mcquarrie matures the whole supply with dives into intrigues and consequences in other words its the directors rather than the characters the engineers instead of the passengers who face the canbeunwinnable trial of raising the bar fortunately victory has never been out of stock and fallout turns what it nabs into a feetoffground fireworksallaround kind of actioner your mission the only one is to be onboard and avoid the bunker at all costs it helps that mcquarrie is again the helmer and the scribe franchises first rendering fallout both a challenge and a possible upgrade or a greater challenge as it can become an upgrade for those believing that rogue nation was sluggish slightly or wholly fallout hears you and in response it moves with the fastforward button held down see the effect right from the start only singledigit minutes four have passed and then ethan is given the briefer which prior to selfdestruction outlines two items  the rising of the apostles aka whats left of incustody mi6 turncoat solomon lane sean harriss syndicate and their need to snatch three plutonium poké balls for an imminent great suffering the usual suspects of closecalls countryhopping maskmaking infiltrations and stunts abound downright great callbacks to every previous mission and satisfying payoffs for every department are also in the cargo hold the latter is why fallout is the same bullettrain on a different track one where the only stopping point is at the end of the line its a setting where a radioactive midnight is one minute away  why thanks ethan for losing the bombs  so such velocity is justified we might feel like the road runner trying to keep up with the proceedings  an armsdealing scioness vanessa kirby seductive through diction knows where the wmds are lane is returning loyalty again forcing ilsa faust rebecca ferguson fashionably chilly to complicate the mission a frustrated cia assigning its own deadly angel henry cavill engaging for support and nightmares with julia michelle monaghan kindness galore  but mcquarrie always has us oriented and amazingly whiplashfree with riveting concision in the penning he guarantees that the prerequisite adeptly built espionagey webs wont entangle us once the details are communicated its all about perfecting the ensuing sensation an mi film with an emotional thread that bears as much impact as the explosions its here and thats a mightyfine bonus on top of the franchises breadandbutter aspects that fallout have either elevated or sharpened though everyones in a hurry production designer peter wenham doesnt use that as an excuse to take shortcuts the conversion of paris grand palais into a classy rave at the front and a jazz club in the back is a definite highlight a new world is yet nigh though composer lorne balfes hymnicthencatastrophic orchestrations editor eddie hamiltons patient cutting and dp rob hardys steadfast framing suggest it has been the state of things after the production logos the impossibility is real the trios work combined with mcquarries direction declared and youll believe it willingly too as ethan halojumped into paris burns rubber on a bike and later a car in something straight out of ronin 20 and bends physics while piloting a heli to a cliffside boxing ring at the home stretch oof the adrenaline just rises upon typing this still we shouldnt ignore that it is in the leading man that mi finds its existence there will come a point where cruise has to refuse the mission and most of us believed it arrived last august intentional or not narrative purposes or otherwise for ethan or his vessel cruise the sense of an ending is suffocating in fallout allowing sweat beads to mingle with the electricity from bigscreen thrills i wont let you down imfs poster agent uttered at one point and afterward itd be wise to believe that you will hear the statement echoing for as long as the team stays in commission
Oct 11 2018,positive,without question the best blockbuster of the year mission accomplished
Oct 10 2018,positive, the film franchise that doubles as tom cruises personal playground and workout center is back in mission impossible  fallout a direct sequel to the last adventure rogue nation cruises ethan hunt unwittingly facilitates the theft of three balls of plutonium snatched up by a covert group arent they always known only as the apostles their mission to distribute these as dirty bombs and trigger a catastrophic global event which could reset life as we know it ethans mission which he never fails to accept is to retrieve the plutonium identify the source known only as john lark and prevent untold destruction the sixth film in a franchise over 20 years old mission impossible  fallout is not breaking any new ground in terms of plot or action spectacle you take your seat and you know exactly what to expect dire circumstances insanely unbelievable rubber masks flashy stunts double agents a handful of gadgets and a 93 chance tom cruise runs like a gazelle at some point before the final credits scroll much like writerdirector christopher mcquarries script this isnt rocket science speaking of the story it is ludicrous and preposterous and i honestly couldnt care less there are films where plot points and continuity errors can crash a movie like this to its knees but mission impossible is exempt for me in this regard in fact i would have a hard time reciting any of the mi plots outside of the first  and still greatest  film in the series as with james bond ethan hunt is a character i want to see either escape or pursue that is his nature so if the plot doesnt matter what does spectacle good oldfashioned eye candy no im not talking about henry cavill and his humongous biceps as cia assassin august walker its the visceral thrills contained within this 2plus hours that will keep audiences on the edge of their seat for the duration in this film alone we have a heartthumping halo jump a motorcycle chase through city traffic the obligatory run tom runnnnn scene where cruise sprints further than that runway in fast and furious 6 and the electric finale with helicopters dueling midair while traversing a mountain range any one of these in another franchise would function as a centerpiece to build a story around in fallout there simply isnt enough time between setpieces for a layered narrative and thats a perfectly acceptable reasoning casting wise the imf returns in full ving rhames simon pegg rebecca ferguson alec baldwin and a pleasant throwback to a character from previous films with the primary addition lying with the impressively massive shoulders that belong to henry cavill august walker is referred to as the hammer to hunts scalpel and this analogy simply boggles the mind im exceptionally boggled while walker prefers the direct approach of using his lethality to confront issues its not like hunt is blowing kisses and hugging babies they both take their problems to pound town leaving gaggles of random terrorist redshirts suffering severe musculature damage in their wake regardless even though cavill emotes as effectively as a random block of wood his sheer stature posits him as a formidable conflict for hunt to contend with that brings me to ethan hunt after 20 years tom cruise has used the magic of his genetic lottery winnings to great advantage as he once again insists on performing most of his own stunts a lot of media attention is paid to this whiter version of jackie chan and his preference to test the limits of insurance payouts by performing in this manner at his age the truth is it works i dont know about you but even with the technology we currently have i can always tell when an actor has had a cgi touchup or a stunt man has taken up his slack you can call tom cruise whatever you want as long as you preface it with this guy would sever his own pinkie toe to make a movie more stimulating for audiences because he proves its true every single time mission impossible  fallout is an exciting spy flick that thrives on that summer movie spirit if you can look past a story youve seen countless times and the weird way mcquarrie chooses to shoot cavill and cruise at cockeyed angles so one of them doesnt appear to be a hobbit compared to the other then strap in for one of the most thrilling films of the summer im still not sure what the hell if anything really happened but i do know tom cruise looked damn good saving us all
Oct 10 2018,positive, tom cruise has done it again i dont know how this dude always does this but he seems like he is a nonstop machine for great action movies the mission impossible franchise has been a great series that survived through some crazy ups and downs however its center cruise has always put out enough effort to make these movies feel special in ways other franchises cant uphold mission impossible  fallout is unique in the franchise for being one of the only direct sequels lots of characters and ideas from the 5th film rogue nation come back to complete their arcs yet at the same time you can enter the movie and still quickly get the stakes ethan hunt cruise cares about people and his team theyll always come before others and hell go out of his way to ensure their safety its a core value to the character that gets pushed to the limits here the real star of this movie beyond cruise has got to be christopher mcquarrie the oscarwinning screenwriter for the usual suspects has now become a cruise specialty director in addition to both mi5 and mi6 mcquarrie directed the first jack reacher film and wrote edge of tomorrow this guy just gets cruise and allows him to jump headfirst into these death traps yet the way he shoots the action is simply unparalleled the first hour of the movie is near perfection you could strip away all the dialogue and easily tell the film through the visual imagery its the closest a movie has come to perfect visual storytelling in the action genre since mad max fury road this is also a film that never really makes you feel its runtime despite a two and half hour runtime the pacing is extraordinary and mcquarrie uses set piece after set piece to deliver amazing scenes you can easily refer to several of those set pieces as instantly iconic the bathroom the club inside the museum the race through paris the helicopter chase each of these scenes is awesome in its own right but when tiled together they create a next level action film the scenes in paris stick out as some of the best scenes in the franchise the cat and mouse game between cruise and vanessa kirby is one for the ages in these movies it is rare for someone to actually go into a scene with cruise and take it over kirby does it over and over again in limited screen time which will make you wish she was in the movie a lot more henry cavill does some okay work but nothing outside of his normal range hes big and bulky a physically formidable member of hunts team the arm reload has got to be one of the funniest yet most badass things in an action movie in years angela bassett makes the most of her screen time and continues to showcase why she should just get cast in everything sean harris proves yet again that the harris bloodline is simply born to act the son of jared harris mad men the crown and richard harris harry potter is someone who can invoke pure evil when he chooses to its a skill that is very underrated and should serve him well in a long career simon pegg and ving rhames are back again helping to make a fun team to surround cruise you can easily argue that rhames is overacting a bit here but hes serviceable through most of the film pegg is very fun again making you wish they used him more rebecca ferguson steals many scenes in the film and again can physically match up with anyone its very similar to evangeline lillys ability to take over antman and the wasp but shes not quite as dynamic overall mission impossible  fallout is one of the best entries in the franchise it is both emotionally and visually exciting to experience while it wont crack my top 10 of the year its clear why it will for some its undeniably one of the best of the summer and should be seen on the biggest screen possible
Sep 28 2018,positive,mission impossible is the closest thing hollywood has going next to a james bond franchise and going it is
Sep 27 2018,positive, the sixth movie in producerstar tom cruises mission impossible series is a marvel of american engineering this exciting semiadult cartoon of espionage could have been laid out in an intricate schematic instead of a screenplay its savvy amalgamation of gimmickry glamour and athletics on the one hand and spy games played like mind games on the other generates tension and release for a superswift 147 minutes  to maintain rooting interest the film injects a shot of idealism every 20 minutes cruises impossible missions force imf agent ethan hunt refuses to sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good he wont leave any imf agent behind when he goes undercover with corrupt movers and shakers he strategizes to avoid killing other law enforcers he even apologizes to a parisian parking cop wounded in the crossfire  the writerdirector christopher mcquarrie has worked with cruise for over a decade writing and coproducing valkyrie 2008 and writing and directing the previous mission impossible movie rogue nation 2015 as well as jack reacher 2012 hes also done credited or uncredited work on the scripts for the edge of tomorrow 2014 the mummy 2017 and mission impossible  ghost protocol 2011 he cleverly uses hunts moral integrity as a source of suspense we wonder how can he keep his conscience clean and get the job done this time he also knows how to keep the drama in his stars wheelhouse mostly by keeping him moving mcquarrie builds extreme action and give into each of the films acts enabling cruises hunt to test his mettle and his metal whether hes operating a vintage bmw sedan or a cuttingedge airbus helicopter like richard lesters famous 1959 comedy short this is a running jumping and standingstill filmalthough the closest hunt comes to standing still is when stuntmanactor liang yang wraps a sinkpipe around cruises neck  the movie dips into bathetic heroworship only when it describes the toll it has taken on hunt to divorce his wife julia michelle monaghan for her protection quelle surprise its not enough for that brasstacks agent luther stickell ving rhames to rumble hunts praises we must hear julia herself a humanitarian nurse give her exhusband credit for pushing her to lead a purposeful life we briefly fear that the movie will turn into a trump cabinet meeting lovefest will imf agent benji dunn simon pegg proclaim ethan the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life luckily the filmmakers restrain themselves the result is a spiffy crowdpleasing contraption getting a canny writerdirector like mcquarrie to take the helm twice in a row ensures the continuity of melodrama and spectacle his films lack the improbable lilt of brad birds ghost protocol the hyperpersonal paranoia and voyeurism of brian de palmas vision in the first film or the romanticism of the john woodirected robert townescripted mi 2 but theyre a big step up from jj abramss typically mechanical mi 3 for the second time mcquarries resourcefulness and energy refresh the bynow familiar tale of hunt beating the clock to foil yet another disillusioned agent turned nihilistic madman this time the top villain is the mysterious john lark who aims to shock our decadent global civilization into starting over he gathers the materials to nuke three holy cities rome mecca and of course jerusalem close to armageddons original location larks atheistic credo the greater the suffering the greater the peace the lunatic visionary of mission impossible  rogue nation solomon lane sean harris comes back into play this time as a bargaining chip a cia agent named walker aka the hammer henry cavill has crushed solomons network of embittered ops the syndicate making way for larks apostles who really are called the apostles angela bassetts erica sloan the new cia director orders that walker be part of ethans mission will walker be competitor friend or foe  the inspiration behind the bigscreen mi series has been to combine the luxurious andor exotic surfaces of the james bond movies with a spy vs spy background as bleak as john le carrés secret and special services and police and security agencies compete for dominance within each country and they work at crosspurposes on the global stage mcquarrie puts these conflicts into sleek comicstrip form except for the imf regulars everyones allegiance is in doubt from the moment they show up on screen that includes the returning british operative ilsa faust rebecca ferguson who was hunts match in mission impossible  rogue nation  one character whos slippery to the end is the chic but lethal arms dealer known as the white widow who puts on an elegant gala as a british philanthropist in paris when she isnt striking dirty deals or wielding a mean butterfly knife vanessa kirby princess margaret in the crowns first two seasons plays her superbly and knowingly as if in homage to another vanessa redgrave indeed redgrave played the arms dealer max in the first film and in a highly touted easter egg the white widow refers to max as her mother  cinematographer rob hardy annihilation uses the giant screen to exploit the glittering nocturnal allure of pariss grand palais and the sunkissed skyscraping grandeur of new zealands southern alps masquerading as kashmir he and the rest of mcquarries team provide the wow factor while cruise supplies the whoa factor whether hes performing aeroacrobatics during a halo jump hanging from tall buildings and cliff walls or chasing a heartless enemy through perilous canyons as he tries to avert nuclear disaster and of course we get the obligatory see tom run scene highlighting under duress his perfect form tight core efficient airchopping arms agee wrote that an ideal gag would bring the victim up the ladder of laughs by cruelly controlled degrees to the top rung and would then proceed to wobble shake wave and brandish the ladder until he groaned for mercy thats what mission impossible  fallout does too i stayed to the final credit in case there was a clever tag but i didnt feel cheated when there wasnt one i needed the time to catch my breath  michael sragow is a

Sep 13 2018,positive,this movie is so bomb it has to be one of the best action films ive seen in a really long time this had me jumping in my seat run dont walk to the theater
Sep 10 2018,positive,i think theres an interesting connection between cruise and the character he playstheres a detachment a sadness around him what hes had to sacrifice to carry the worlds burden on his shoulders
Sep 8 2018,positive, a triumph of action movie filmmaking mission impossible  fallout builds  upon its wellestablished formula of firstclass entertainment to make for a  high stakes high quality and character rich sure to be action classic since its inception in 1996 the mission impossible film series has gone from strength to strength  fuelled by tom cruises star power and fearless approach to action performance  this once faltering franchise found its groove and its popularity after the  excellent mission impossible 3 and with it the addition of jj abrams star  wars the force awakens to the fore now the sixth entry mission impossible  fallout has  taken that winning formula of highgrade highstakes action scenarios and  cruises allin intensity to breathtaking new heights exactly how cruise and  company will follow up this one will be an impossible mission in itself  written and directed by christopher mcquarrie jack  reacher mission impossible   fallout finds imf agent etan hunt tom cruise and his team luther ving  rhames and benji simon pegg on the hunt for missing nuclear weapons that  have fallen in the hands of mysterious terrorist group the apostles led by  hunts archnemesis solomon lane sean harris to make things complicated  also on the chase for lane is hunts onetime love interest mi6 agent ilsa  faust rebecca ferguson and cia agent august walker henry cavill an incredibly choreographed fight scene inside a  gentlemans bathroom features cavill at his fist swinging bonecrunching best  trading barbs and sharing action beats with cruise who no doubt relished  having superman himself in his franchise great too is rebecca ferguson who  continues to bring that scenestealing mix of disarming beauty and action  performance smarts to a role that very much deserves its own spinoff mcquarrie has delivered an action movie that is as  serious as a heart attack yet which knows how to entertain as well where the  likes of the dark knight skyfall and mad max fury road have  evolved the genre to new heights mcquarrie has successfully taken fallout to the top of the action movie  foodchain its action scenes are crisp clean and incredibly well  choreographed and executed motor bikes helicopters guns firsts nuclear  bombsmcquarrie brings out all the action goodies for his actors to play with  where the whole fate of the world trump card has been played before here  mcquarrie makes those skyhigh stakes feel palpable having cruise do his maverick daredevil actionman  shtick makes it all feel even more palpable outside of jackie chan its hard  to think of a megastar actor who has placed life and limb on the line with the  same skill and intensity as cruise that he is also a fine actor brings more  dimensions to his ethan hunt who since mission  impossible iii has been given an arch thats evolved from one successive  film to another and hits pay dirt here action films are great eyecandy this is true but they  can also emote with the same power as your average oscar drama mission impossible  fallout is  another prime example of that here is a film of spectacle and personality  thrills and feeling great technical skill and fine storytelling it just also  may be film of the year now that is mission accomplished
