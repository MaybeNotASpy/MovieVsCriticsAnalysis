"Dec 19, 2023",positive," A pesar de que cada año su audiencia es más baja, los premios de la Academia de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas (conocidos popularmente como los Premios Óscar) siguen marcando el final de la temporada de premios dentro de la industria del cine, cuyo inicio está marcado por las nominaciones a los Globos de Oro. Entre diciembre de un año y marzo del siguiente, la prensa, los críticos, los integrantes de la industria cinematográfica y el público comienzan a debatir sobre las mejores películas del año. Algo tan absurdo como divertido. Absurdo porque, en la mayoría de los casos, el hecho de que una película llegue a estar nominada puede ser proporcional a la cantidad de dinero que distribuidores y productores invierten en campañas casi más propagandísticas que publicitarias. De cara a la temporada que cierra meses más tarde con los Óscar, los estudios y las casas productoras comienzan a empapelar Los Ángeles y hacer públicas sus campañas de for your consideration —para su consideración—. En estas se llega a incluir las categorías a las que la película “merece” estar nominada. Con el fin de llamar la atención de los votantes que nominarán y, finalmente, premiarán a una serie de películas cuyos nombres tienden a repetirse a medida que las ceremonias avanzan. Sin embargo, a pesar de lo absurdas, polémicas o manipuladas que puedan ser ciertas premiaciones, no dejan de ser una fiesta del cine muy divertida de ver, donde los “grandes” de la industria se aplauden a sí mismos mientras aprovechan el escenario y el galardón como plataforma para dar discursos políticos o ideológicos. En los últimos años han mencionado el empoderamiento femenino, el calentamiento global, el racismo y hasta la inseminación artificial de vacas, cuando Joaquin Phoenix recibió su premio al mejor actor por su papel en Joker (2019). Y entre lo espectacular —en el sentido más literal de la palabra— de estas premiaciones, lo bochornosas que pueden llegar a ser y esa innata necesidad del ser humano por tomar partido por un bando u otro, estas transmisiones, con sus alfombras rojas, famosos vestidos de gala y segundos de tensión antes de la revelación de los ganadores, se vuelven algo casi que obligatorio de mirar para cualquier persona apasionada por el cine. Por las modalidades y criterios de selección, ciertas tendencias históricas o, simplemente, por no contar con suficiente poder económico para sustentar una gran campaña, a muchas películas no les llega la invitación a la gran fiesta de la Academia de Hollywood, que se llevará a cabo este domingo 12 de marzo en el Dolby Theatre de Los Ángeles. Y como esta falta de exposición puede llevar a que algunas grandes películas sufran una falta de interés, o incluso de conciencia sobre su existencia, presentamos una lista de cinco películas que no cuentan con ninguna nominación a los Premios Óscar pero que realmente vale la pena ver. Robert Eggers forma parte de una nueva generación de directores, junto con Ari Aster (Hereditary, Midsommar) y Jordan Peele (Get Out, Us, Nope), que pisan fuerte en el cine de terror actual; ese terror que popularmente se ha empezado a considerar elevated horror. Ese término hace referencia a que se trata de películas de terror pero con un contenido subtextual más complejo o intelectual. Eggers saltó a la fama con The Witch (2015), protagonizada por —una todavía no famosa— Anya Taylor-Joy, y se consagró con The Lighthouse (2019), que interpretaron Robert Pattinson y Willem Dafoe. El hombre del norte (como se estrenó localmente), se aleja por completo de las estructuras minimalistas y perturbadoras de Eggers y da paso a su primera megaproducción, que aunque fue muy bien recibida, tanto por la crítica como por el público, fue un fracaso en taquilla: no superó su presupuesto. Uno altísimo, como era de esperarse para una película cuyo elenco incluye a Alexander Skarsgård, Anya Taylor-Joy (con salario actualizado), Nicole Kidman, Björk, Ethan Hawke y Willem Dafoe. Bajo el mantra “te vengaré, padre. Te salvaré, madre. Te mataré, Fjölnir”, el príncipe Amleth emprende un viaje de venganza que se adapta de una leyenda medieval escandinava, que fue ni más ni menos la que le dio existencia al Hamlet de Shakespeare siglos más tarde. Ni la tragedia ni Eggers escatiman en violencia, gritos, sudor, sangre y espadas, junto con una puesta en escena ambiciosa, una de las mejores fotografías y una de las bandas sonoras más épicas del año, brindan un relato que, incluso si sabemos a dónde va a llegar, es tan atractivo como difícil de ver. El trabajo de Eggers hasta ahora ha sido ignorado por los Óscar, algo que parece importarle poco a él y a sus colegas de El faro, quienes no han dudado en mostrar sus pocas pulgas al mejor estilo Dibu Martínez en varias oportunidades. The Northman está disponible para ver en HBO Max. Una de las mayores sorpresas al anunciarse la lista de nominados a mejor película internacional para la 95.ª edición de los Premios Óscar, fue la ausencia de la nueva película del coreano Park Chan-wook. El director de la “trilogía de la venganza”, principalmente conocido por Oldboy (2003), tiene como marca autoral el tratamiento de la violencia en toda su filmografía. Decision to leave no es la excepción a esto, pero con sutileza. El montaje va mucho más allá del simple acto de cortar y pegar; las actuaciones son de primer nivel. El director asiático logra hacer una película mucho más violenta que las anteriores a través de la construcción de una relación sumamente tóxica entre un detective que se enamora de su principal sospechosa. Decision to leave es una película policial de misterio, pero con tintes de romance que hacen que el argumento se vuelva cada vez más complejo. A medida que la película avanza, se vuelve admirable cómo Park Chan-wook afirma que, a veces, la violencia se expresa de diferentes formas. En este caso, no serán ni las armas, ni la sangre, ni las grandes secuencias de combate, sino el amor, que teñirá de rojo sangre las retinas de los espectadores a pesar de no explicitarlo en pantalla, algo que parece homenajear y actualizar a la también coreana y tétrica Hanyo (o La criada, de 1960, dirigida por Kim Ki- young). Esta es una película ideal para aquellos apasionados por los giros de tuerca trabajados con sutileza y que no dejan de sorprender. La película tenía proyectado su estreno en salas de cine de Uruguay, pero fue cancelado (posiblemente apostando a que la gente solo la vería si estaba nominada a los Óscar…). Actualmente está disponible en internet vía pay per view y posiblemente sea estrenada en alguna plataforma en los próximos meses. Quien diga que Adam Sandler no es un buen actor y no merece ser reconocido como tal, es por que no ha visto su trabajo en Punch-Drunk, Love, de Paul Thomas Anderson, o Uncunt Gems, de los hermanos Safdie. Tampoco su última película, Hustle, sobre un exbasquetbolista y actual cazatalentos que se propone convertir en estrella a un jugador de básquetbol que encontró por casualidad en un partido callejero en España. Garra, título en español, es posiblemente la más popular de esta lista dado que su estreno fue en Netflix, y es, sin dudas, la más amigable de todas. Una clásica película donde el deporte y alcanzar el éxito sirve como metáfora para la superación, construcción y reconstrucción personal. Pero la nueva película de Sandler no se queda solo con eso, sino que cuenta la historia de un veterano frustrado que hará lo que tenga que hacer para cumplir sus sueños proyectándolos en alguien más. Con un increíble despliegue deportivo, porque la protagonizan estrellas del basquetbol de la NBA; una combinación ideal de drama y humor; y una sensación de calidez que se transmite en cada momento. Es una película ideal para pasar un buen rato y hasta para ver en familia. Este animé (animación japonesa) no fue formalmente excluido de los premios de la academia de este año, sino de los del año pasado, dado que su estreno y postulación para el mercado estadounidense fue en 2021 y no en 2022. Sin embargo, llegó a salas de cine latinoamericanas, y posteriormente a Netflix, en 2022. Se llevó el premio a la mejor película animada del año por parte de la Asociación de Críticos de Cine del Uruguay (ACCU) en diciembre del año pasado. La historia de Belle es una nueva adaptación del clásico La bella y la bestia, pero extrapolado al mundo moderno e isekai (subgénero de fantasía japonesa), en el que los personajes viven sus aventuras en un mundo de fantasía, en este caso, a través de un juego de rol al mejor estilo Second Life, un género cuyo director ya manejaba con soltura por haber trabajado en varias entregas de la franquicia de animé Digimon. En esta actualización del cuento francés, Suzu, la protagonista, es una joven introvertida que logra volverse una estrella anónima con su avatar en un mundo digital, que es un híbrido entre los juegos de rol de realidad inmersiva y las redes sociales. Dentro de este mundo, Suzu conocerá al Dragón (la bestia) con quien inmediatamente generará un vínculo muy fuerte, pero Hosoda se encargará de darle un giro inesperado para traer el cuento clásico al mundo moderno, exponiendo todo lo que puede haber detrás de un simple avatar en una red social. La película se encuentra disponible en Netflix. Si Hustle era la más conocida de esta selección, esta película danesa es probablemente la más difícil de encontrar. Original de la plataforma Shudder (no disponible en Uruguay), Speak no evil es una película de horror que juega, a su vez, con la sátira para llevarnos a lugares oscuros de los que difícilmente podamos salir sin algún tipo de secuela. Perturbadora, es una película que cada vez que se la vuelva a ver, más detalles se encuentran. La prensa es simple: una familia danesa es invitada a pasar un fin de semana en la casa de unos holandeses que conocieron en un viaje a Italia. El filme construye la tensión y el horror desde sus primeros minutos y no más de dos escenas. Al director, Christian Tafdrup, no le hace falta más que una banda sonora sumamente indicativa y una secuencia de montaje que roza lo intelectual para contarnos todo lo que pasará en la película en menos de cinco minutos. Pero lejos de ser una desventaja para nuestra atención como espectadores, la película sabe exactamente qué hacer para, incluso sabiendo a donde iremos, adentrarnos cada vez más en lo oscuro de su universo. Sus personajes tienden a tomar las peores decisiones, lo que generará una frustración que el espectador cargará a lo largo de la película. Así, dará situaciones incómodas una atrás de la otra y, además, todas giran en torno a la misma idea: la ingenuidad y lo políticamente correcto, así como la pasividad que esto acarrea y las consecuencias a las que puede llegar. Esta limitada selección es solo una muestra de que, por más atractivo que sea sintonizar la transmisión de los Premios Óscar este domingo 12 de marzo, también es altamente recomendable explorar opciones que estén por fuera del radar de las ceremonias de premios, ya que podremos encontrarnos con opciones variadas para todos los gustos y que, muchas veces, dejamos pasar por no contar con un reconocimiento bastante frío y arbitrario.

"Oct 31, 2023",positive," Now, I’m not one to brag, but when I was younger I hobnobbed with a Hollywood celebrity and her family. Her name was Cheryl, and she lived on the opposite side of our cul-de-sac in a Tyrone area neighborhood in St. Petersburg. I knew her before her big-screen debut, and I am happy to say that her newfound fame did not change her one bit. Cheryl landed a part in the 1978 film “The Norseman,” which was filmed right here in the Tampa Bay area. This low-budget American International Pictures cast Lee Majors — still riding high on the success of his television show “The Six Million Dollar Man” — as an 11th-century Viking prince who travels to the shores of North America in search of his missing father. Being a 10-year-old kid, all I knew was Cheryl was in a movie with Lee Majors. In my mind, this meant she must be the female lead and the hero’s love interest. Of course, Cheryl was an extra — one of dozens, if not hundreds. The production company had put out a call for anyone in the area with Native American heritage. Didn’t matter: She was still a star, even if I couldn’t find her on screen when my parents took me to see “The Norseman” at Tyrone Square Mall. I thought about Cheryl when I read visionary writer-director Robert Eggers was filming “The Northman.” Although both epic historical dramas revolve around Vikings, the two films are as different as night and day. Where “The Norseman” feels like a formula swashbuckler with a heavy ’70s vibe and little attention to historical detail, “The Northman” is rooted in history and inspired by literature and legends. Eggers — known for blurring the line between reality and fantastical dreamscapes — creates a kaleidoscopic spectacle of hallucinatory imagery and blood-spattered brutality. The director’s two previous films — “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” — both earned high praise from critics. “The Northman” was released April 22 in theaters. The film opens in the year 895 A.D. with young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak), son of King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), joining in festivities to welcome home his father from some overseas campaign. Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) is notably less enthusiastic about the king’s return.  Though still wounded from his conquests, the king summons his son to take part in a rite of passage to prove his worthiness as heir to the throne. Immediately following the ceremony, Amleth sees his father murdered by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Though Fjölnir orders his men to kill the king’s heir, Amleth escapes and vows to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. Yes, of course this sounds familiar. Amleth is a figure in a medieval Scandinavian legend. He serves as the direct inspiration of Prince Hamlet in Shakespeare’s tragedy Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.  “The Northman” jumps forward a few years, with an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) living among a band of Vikings and fighting alongside them as a berserker. Following a raid on a village in the land of the Rus on the Baltic Sea, Amleth encounters the Seeress (Björk), who reminds him of his oath of vengeance and foretells elements of his destiny. He also discovers Fjölnir fled to Iceland after he was overthrown by Harald of Norway.  No need to elaborate on how this revenge saga plays out, other than to say it’s brutal, bloody, and occasionally unhinged. Eggers serves up this timeless tale with as much pomp and circumstance as panache and savagery. It feels simultaneously archetypical and innovative. Beyond its connection to Scandinavian legend, the film draws from various literary and cinematic sources. A sequence in which Amleth recovers a prophesied sword brings to mind a similar scene from John Milius’ 1982 film “Conan the Barbarian,” which itself was likely based upon the 1967 story “The Thing in the Crypt” by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, using Robert E. Howard’s character Conan. As usual, Eggers goes to extraordinary lengths to achieve a level of historical accuracy in “The Northman.” He also imbues the film with mysticism and religious conviction, emphasizing the importance of divinity among these characters. Eggers makes it clear that their gods are not just vague, impersonal figures in a sprawling pantheon — they are ubiquitous and accessible, and they are part of the very fabric of life.  “I thought Vikings were violent, hulking brutes with nothing of interest,” the director says in the film’s production notes. “My wife, on the other hand, had been fond of the Icelandic Sagas, the esteemed medieval stories of Viking lore, and she knew that I would love them. But even at her insistence, I never opened one of these great books.” “I immediately imagined solitary tenth century figures on horseback, dwarfed by supernaturally colored mountains, glaciers, and infinite skies,” he said. “There was something about the elements, and the elemental that cried out from the landscapes.” Working with archeologists and historians, Eggers sought to recreate the minutiae of the physical world, while also attempting to portray the inner world of the Viking mind, including their beliefs, mythology, and ritual life.  In that sense, “The Northman” is an unequivocal success. It is steeped in history and legend, dripping with eeriness and barbarity, and it echoes Arthurian and Shakespearian motifs. Filled with stunning cinematography, the film is an intense, immersive, sometimes surreal, descent into an otherworldly milieu of folkloric horror and medieval barbarism.  How mainstream audiences will react to “The Northman” depends upon their willingness to embrace Eggers’ distinct visual style and brooding tone. Despite its epic scope, the film retains an arthouse ambiance and — beyond the revenge theme at its heart — examines the toll of cyclic violence as well as man’s enduring inhumanity. If that sort of thing appeals to you, catch it while it’s in the theaters for the ultimate experience: You’re likely to wince more than once as if the blood and mud might fly off the screen and hit you in the face."
"Sep 17, 2023",positive," Director Robert Eggers has stated that in making The Northman, he hoped to achieve the ultimate Viking Epic. Although it is difficult to say whether he has succeeded, what remains true of the film is that it is indeed epic in every possible sense — a visually spectacular feast that grips the audience from its opening moments until the arresting finale. Coming out of an impressive run with two smaller budget films, 2015’s The Witch and 2019’s The Lighthouse, Eggers is given a 90 million USD budget to expand his idiosyncratic world-building into an indelible and violent film that remains recognizable to his arthouse style yet is given the breadth to bring that vision to a mainstream audience. The story comes from Norse legend. Amleth is a tale that became the boilerplate for ‘Hamlet,’ but Eggers and multi-hyphenate talent Sjón have changed elements of the story drastically. In the original versions, Amleth, after witnessing the slaying of his father, feigns being a fool to later enact revenge on his uncle, who has usurped the kingdom. Eggers and Sjón have done away with the fool Amleth and have replaced him with a hardened warrior consumed by revenge. Arguably as the story plays out, Amleth’s quest for revenge does seem foolish as the cost is unfathomably high and his drive to destroy his uncle is a kind of madness that is ruinous to him. The year is 895 AD, and Amleth (played as a boy by Oscar Novak) is a young King in training. His father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), has returned from battle with his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth and his mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), greet the wounded but triumphant warrior. In Amleth’s eyes, his father is a hero and righteous King who brings glory to the people. Furthermore, Aurvandil is an attentive and loving father who is preparing Amleth’s succession to the throne. Eggers takes us through some of Amleth’s rites of passage, including a psychedelic encounter with Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe), where they ingest hallucinogens and throw off their humanity to see the manifest destiny of their family line. Stylistically, this scene is very much in Eggers’ playbook — the reality and unreality exist at once. For Aurvandil and Amleth, the magic is not metaphor; they believe in their Gods and the forces of the supernatural. Soon after Aurvandil’s return, Amleth witnesses the treacherous attack of his uncle Fjölnir, who, with a band of loyal men, brutally dispatch Aurvandil and hunt down and try to kill Amleth. Almeth witnesses the coup and sees Fjölnir take his mother, Gudrún, as his new queen. Escaping the kingdom, Amleth vows that he will avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir. Years pass, and Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) is a muscular Berserker living in the land of Rus. Amleth’s humanity has all but disappeared, and he is a killing machine. Eggers spares the audience little as he takes us through long shots of the Vikings destroying villages and collecting slaves. Skarsgård is an imposing presence both physically and because he is violence personified. Blood and mud-soaked, he fills the frame with menace. In a sacked village, Amleth encounters a Seeress (played by Björk in her first speaking role in a film since Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark) who reminds him of his oath to destroy Fjölnir and restore his family line. She warns him that the revenge will come at a cost, and he will have to sacrifice his kindness and kin. Soon thereafter, he hears that the slaves the Berserkers have captured are destined for Fjölnir, who has lost his kingdom and is rebuilding his community in Iceland. Amleth brands himself a slave and is taken in shackles to the new land. Fellow captured slave Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) takes an interest in Amleth as she can see that he is not a sheep but something more. To eventually escape her captors, Olga claims she will use her mind which is as powerful a weapon as Amleth’s brawn. The two become lovers and co-conspirators in Fjölnir’s downfall. Amleth’s quest for revenge teeters between realism and a fever dream. Eggers spins us in and out of reality in a style so clearly his own. The larger budget allows for sheer magnificence as he takes us through the kingdoms. Vistas are sweeping and glorious. Yet, despite this, they don’t really add to the narrative heft of the film. Ironically, it is the scenes filmed in close quarters that are the most impressive. Eggers excels at the surreal and otherworldly, but this comes mainly through the script. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, The Lighthouse (2019), manages to capture both extremes of Eggers’ vision. Still, it is those moments where the camera is close to the action that are more distinctly discombobulating and fascinating. Alexander Skarsgård, The Legend of Tarzan (2016), is quite simply a magnificent beast in the film. Amleth, given reason to reclaim his humanity through his love for Olga, becomes more complex and nuanced than the man who lives only through violence and hatred. Although Skarsgård’s performance is predominantly physical, there is space for him to portray the character’s grief, betrayal, confusion, and vulnerability. Nicole Kidman as Gudrún is given one of the most effective scenes in the film. Gudrún’s steel is unexpected, and Kidman, once again, proves that even with a supporting role, she is built to surprise and impress. Sadly, Anya Taylor-Joy isn’t given as much meat as one would hope for the ostensible lead actress. Her accent, unplaceable and confusing, often lifts the audience out of the diegetic world. Perhaps it is because Olga is essentially an adjunct to Amleth and a means for him to question his quest and devotion to violence that she seems somewhat underwritten. Taylor-Joy has proven many times in her relatively short career (essentially kickstarted by Eggers in The Witch) that she is a profoundly compelling presence. Whilst she is on screen, it is difficult to look away from her, but as one contemplates Olga, the less the character seems to exist for anything but another rite-of-passage for Amleth. As a bloody and most certainly trippy revenge tale, The Northman is astounding in many places. Eggers may not have created the ultimate Viking tale, but he has crafted an astonishing spectacle that combines his established style with something larger. The film is indeed epic in scope and scale. However, it feels its most authentic when it is obviously Eggers. The myth and magic at the heart of the tale are more interesting than the revenge narrative. Eggers also seems somewhat forgiving of the brutality of Viking culture. Amleth is our hero, and because of what befell him, his violence seems justified. Eggers does end on a nihilistic note that then transforms into a reward for Amleth’s bloody vengeance. To an extent, Eggers’ films are open to many interpretations, and The Northman is no exception. However, as a visual experience, it is marvelous even if it isn’t as thematically rich as his previous works. Strap in for a wild and violent ride and let Eggers engulf your senses."
"Aug 16, 2023",positive," Despite Covid, we finally got back to the movies the way we knew them, as evidenced by “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Avatar: The Way of Water” buzzing and flooding the box office. There were fewer masks, ID checks or sit-in-every-other-seat stipulations, but streaming did make clear inroads on how we see entertainment. Of the 10 films the Day selected for our Top Films of 2022, two (“Decision to Leave” and “RRR”) played exclusively on the small screen; three are Non-English-language; three had limited releases (“Emily the Criminal,” “God’s Country” and “Fire of Love”) and can now be found on streaming platforms, but resonated enough with the Day’s critics to make the list; and there is one documentary. A diverse list of must-sees. The latest from Korean director Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy,” “The Handmaiden”) is a dark crime drama in which the lives of a police detective and murder suspect intersect and fold in on each other. It’s a psychological thriller that has Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) looking into the curious death of a skilled rock climber who fell despite safety measures. Gathering the mountainside evidence makes for an interesting process, with a second detective strapped to Hae-jun’s back as they rope walk up the sheer surface. Suspicion falls on the wife, Seo-rae (Tang Wei), a Chinese immigrant who’s not quite fluent in Korean – did I mention that her departed husband was an immigration official? Hae-jun is a hands-on profiler sort and in scenes when observing Seo-rae, he’s suddenly in the room, a ghost to her, observing her. It’s a neat device Park throws at us that blurs the lines between reality and projection. It’s also a reflection of Hae-jun’s detached demeanor; he’s an insomniac, and has a strangely dysfunctional sex life with his wife. Natch, Hae-jun and Seo-rae have an attraction to each other that hangs dank and ripe in every scene they’re in. In the second part of the hypnotic slow burn, both have relocated to the same new city where Seo-rae is married to a fund manager and works as a caregiver to the old. It’s here that the film moves into darker territory, as Seo-rae is visited by a disgruntled client of her husband who slaps her around (the character is actually named Slappy) and there’s another death that cannot be misconstrued an accident or suicide. Of course Hae-jun is the one assigned the case. How Park lays down the cards does have reveals, but it’s mostly a deeply internal reckoning by Hae-jun. The film feels a bit like a true-crime noir and would make a perfect double bill with countryman Bong Joon Ho’s “Memories of Murder” (2003), about Korea’s first true documented serial killer. (Tom Meek) On Mubi. Besides a deep emotional journey, the revelation of Davy Chou’s “Return to Seoul” is the phenomenal debut performance by Ji-Min Park as Freddie, a 25-year-old adoptee who travels from her home in France to Seoul, South Korea, in reluctant search of her biological parents. Energized and hypnotic, with scenes of Freddie letting loose and dancing alone center stage at a bar (a best-dance-scene-ever candidate) or a tense family meal broken by translations and clear misunderstandings, it’s the palpable undercurrent of rage communicated by Park that links it all together. Adrift in a world where she is of two (and many more) parts and struggling to assimilate as a Korean-born transplant who speaks fluent French, some English and a modicum of Korean – but by norms is expected to behave within Korean custom and genuflection when there – her story is a familiar one for many, but set apart. An aching open wound, “Return to Seoul” begs the question of where we find our identity, how much of it is shaped by where we grow up and with whom, and the power of the perception of others. (Ally Johnson) Not in theaters or online. Todd Field’s first film in 15 years following “Little Children” likely could not have come into existence without its star, Cate Blanchett, who delivers a turn so bravura, lived-in and essential that it may just be the most defining performance of a highly accomplished career that already has notched two Oscars (“Blue Jasmine” and “The Aviator”). Her Lydia Tár, the commanding maestro of the Berlin Philharmonic, is a barrier breaker and even more so, a breaker of souls. Lydia has a wife and daughter – she’s a self labeled “U-Haul lesbian” – and also manipulative, often cruel, if not abusive, and an opportunist fostering and engaging in several inappropriate relations with young aspiring female musicians and conductors. Field’s provocative flip is of a woman behaving as entitled and above the law as many a miscreant called out and cut down via the #MeToo movement. The astute use of sound, both atmospheric and Lydia’s keen perception of it, gives the film an aurally immersive texture that deepens the moral contemplation. Let’s hope it’s not another 15 year for Field’s next potential magnum opus. Read a full review from Oct 13. (Tom Meek) Available for purchase online. As heartbreaking as it is hilarious, “The Banshees of Inisherin” is a tremendous deconstruction of what happens to the human condition when the hands on the clock begin to move rapid. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”), the film and its stars revel in the filmmaker’s taste for the macabre. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play lifelong friends whose relationship is suddenly severed by Gleeson’s Colm with little to no reasoning. A meditation on the necessity of art and escaping life’s mundanities in contrast to the simplicity of enjoying our time together just for the sake of it rather than pushing forward, it’s paradoxically hopeless as it is life-affirming by the film’s end. Farrell delivers career-best work with Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan all excellent as well. Read a full review from Oct. 28. (Ally Johnson) On HBO Max. Jersey-accented Emily (Aubrey Plaza, recently seen in the second season of “The White Lotus”), an art school dropout with a criminal record, is stuck in gig-job purgatory and soaring student-loan debt. Tired of earning chump change and not realizing her dreams or making a livable wage, she dips her toe in the prosaic criminal underworld as a “dummy shopper,” using fake IDs and credit cards to buy expensive goods to sell on the black market. Emily flirts with her illicit mentor and fellow dreamer Youcef (Luke Cage’s Theo Rossi, playing to type as a man with a weakness for powerful, angry women) and turning misappropriation into her full-time job. The money is enticing, but danger mounts. Here Plaza finally gets to play a character that matches the distinctness of her simmering television role of April Ludgate on “Parks and Recreation.” John Patton Ford’s directorial debut is captivating as the threats to Emily’s well-being escalate from being called out for lying in an interview to physical harm. Plaza projects her character’s apprehension and channels it into moral outrage directed at her attackers as well as her physical and societal limitations. (Sarah Vincent) On Netflix. Sara Dosa’s documentary about renowned French volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft has tons of eye-popping footage of flowing rivers of boiling lava and bellowing volcanos. It’s “wow” with a capital W and ever mesmerizing, if not hypnotic, and you can easily get why the Kraffts became so obsessed with these earth-shaping phenoms. Of course there’s sudden danger that comes with storm-chasing volcanic eruptions, and the couple died in the 1991 eruption of Japan’s Mount Unzen. The film’s title is purposefully multilayered, referring to the couple’s love for one another as well as their unquenchable passion for all things hot, molten and flowing. Narrated by Miranda July with a warm but oddly flat and twee intonation, the film transforms the Kraffts’ vast ’87 archive into a world-hopping travelogue punctuated by eruptions and opulent rivers of red. In construct, “Fire of Love” calls to mind Werner Herzog’s “Grizzly Man” (2005), because there too an obsession with something massive and lethal threatens to become deadly in nearly every frame – and ultimately does. (Tom Meek) On Disney+. Viking Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) seeks to avenge his father’s death, rescue his mother, Gudrun (Nicole Kidman in a fearless, taboo-shattering performance) and reclaim his identity. His quest transforms him from being an animalistic killing machine to a man who sacrifices himself to break the cycle of violence for his future family and fight for the freedom of those he enslaved. For the project, Skarsgård nagged writer and director Robert Eggers to adapt an old Icelandic poem, an antecedent to Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” In the “gods’ war,” the characters are consenting shamanistic avatars for raven god Odin, fertility god Freyr and the Norns of Fate in the form of a seeress (Björk) rooting for Amleth’s unlikely ally, enslaved Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) with Amleth as a pawn to protect her queen. Eggers’ visual style is a roller coaster of primordial, oneiric imagery of an epic, wild landscape, turbulent supernatural forces and untamed nature sans any whiff of domestication. Read the full review from April 22. (Sarah Vincent) On Amazon Prime Video. The sublime, multitalented Michelle Yeoh (“Supercop,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), stars in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” as Evelyn, a middle-aged Chinese immigrant who discovers  around the Lunar New Year while juggling a tax audit, receiving a visit from a judgmental father and handling multiple family crises that she is the multiverse’s savior. Writers and directors The Daniels’ surreal feature blends sci-fi, action, horror and comedy without neglecting the story’s heart: finding meaning in life through love and kindness to others. The genre mashup provides a fuller insight into the characters’ personalities than a drama could. The multiverse is a metaphor for the different facets of peoples’ potential and makes their internal lives literal. The immigrant, laundry lady and bureaucrat often appear in the margins of other films; The Daniels’ beautiful elevation of them honors these unsung pillars of society. They turned their moms and dads into flawed heroes, while the audit and the threat to the multiverse serve the same function of forcing Evelyn to assess her life and decide if she wants to stay the course, change or give up. It creates the possibility of redemption and renewal for her as an individual. By healing herself in this epic journey, she can heal generational trauma. Read the full review from March 31.

Rajamouli’s three-hour-plus epic is a bold, outrageous spectacle, peppered with thrills, jaw-dropping stunt work, breakouts into Bollywood dance and a poke in the Western eye about the evils of colonialism. The Indian production takes place in the 1920s, when the country was under British rule. Our bigger-than-life heroes come in the form of Raju (the highly charismatic Ram Charan Teja), an Indian soldier under British command, and Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.), a can-do villager and mechanic whose daughter has been abducted by the British governor (Ray Stevenson). The governor’s so hyperbolically nefarious they could have just called him Snidely Whiplash and been done with it, and his wife (Alison Doody) is nearly as nasty; at one point she supplies a torturer with a barbed whip. We meet each protagonist separately, each performing Herculean feats: Raju battling through a throng of hundreds, who hammer and pound him, to apprehend a suspect; Bheem outrunning a wolf and, bare-chested, shouting down a tiger. (The CGI is pretty low budget, but it hardly matters.) Later the two team up to save a boy above a flaming river, but even later in the epic run time find themselves at odds because of Raju’s allegiance and Bheem’s ceaseless quest to regain his daughter from Raju’s higher-up. “RRR” (for “Rise, Roar, Revolt”) is astonishingly energetic from start to finish, tongue-in-cheek craziness that sometimes strains but never breaks the wild turning and dropping ride. (Tom Meek) On Netflix. Professor Sandra Guidry (Thandiwe Newton, “Crash”) lives in a wide-open, snowcapped mountainous wilderness of Montana and works in the warm halls of civilized academia. After two hunters use her property without permission, she leaves a note on the windshield of their pickup truck; when they keep coming back, she refuses to back down despite the physical disparity and looming threat they pose. Julian Higgins’ neo-Western turns the trope of the lone stranger not looking for trouble on its head in unexpected, beautiful and tragic ways. Guidry rejects cynicism and is compelled to confront and change the things she cannot accept, but that list grows as the movie unfolds. Like most women in Westerns, she cries out for civilization: “We all gotta play by the same rules if this is gonna work.” Because of a lack of resources, weak character or corruption, authority figures fail to heed her cry for justice. Once Guidry’s past is revealed, she is no damsel in distress, but remains grappling with frustration over her inability to protect others. This is an unpredictable, majestic visual feast, sparse with dialogue and rife with superb performances, and Higgins’ sophomore feature is a strong contender for best American film of the year.

"Jul 25, 2023",positive,"Robert Eggers has crafted one for the ages… The Northman  is a cinematic epic that blew my mind from start to finish. Lavishing cinematography that brings to life this era, visceral violence that adds to the world, & a jaw dropping third act"
"Jul 25, 2023",positive," To know director Robert Eggers is to know a remarkable master of light, sound, and storytelling all wrapped up in a single film. 2019’s The Lighthouse broke rules when it came to how a simple story could turn into a visual stunner for the senses. With Eggers’s latest, The Northman, the American director takes audiences through a forgotten time of valkyries, vikings, and revenge…which is definitely a dish served very very cold.  The Northman stars Alexander Skarsgard as Amleth, a viking prince on a journey to avenge his father’s death and save his mother from the hands of his evil uncle. Sound familiar? It should, as it is the same basic plot of Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Disney’s The Lion King. Similarities aside, The Northman proves to be a standalone film that is a cut above the rest. We start with a young Amleth in 895 AD, traversing his life in the North Atlantic with his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and his mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Their kingdom is a snow covered wonderland, where the King is always tasked with the ungodly chore of battling others to keep his family and kingdom safe. Unfortunately for the King, the true evil comes from within his own family, as his only brother, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), plots against him to take over the kingdom. While witnessing the death of his father at the hands of his uncle in a torturous ambush, young Amleth flees his homeland uttering his creed to himself, “I will avenge you father, I will save you mother, I will kill you Fjolnir.” We cut to a much older, and hot as fuck, Amleth, who is a true viking in an animalistic society where he helps to destroy towns and take others as his prisoner. Fit and full of rage, Amleth is the definition of strength on the outside, while wrestling with demons of hate on the inside. Still intending to follow through with his promise to his father and mother, Amleth hears rumors of his uncle’s whereabouts, and sets off on a plan to finally take what is rightfully his.  Boarding a slave ship as a stowaway, Amleth meets the incredibly beautiful Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), who agrees to become his most trusted ally throughout his quest. As the slave ship docks in Iceland, Amleth quickly discovers his uncle and mother, as well as their two children, have taken over this new land as they were dethrowned by others in Amleth’s original kingdom. Disguising himself as a slave and unrecognizable in his older years, he attempts to gain the trust of his uncle, before he plans to wield a sword into his father’s killer. The Northman is an incredibly gifted film full of hostility, genealogy, strength, and desire. Alexander Skarsgard is picture perfect as Amleth, a man with one solitary vision for how his life should go, based upon the dreams of his father. Anya Taylor-Joy is ferociously talented as Amleth’s ally and love interest, while Claes Bang gives a truly horrifying performance as the main villain. The only drawback to the film’s success is Kidman’s casting, as it brings memories of when Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell were cast as the mother/son duo in Alexander. Kidman and the twist in the middle of the film go hand in hand, but it would’ve been preferable to have cast an actress that didn’t just play Skarsgard’s battered wife in a famous series, Big Little Lies. Without giving away too much more, Eggers’s use of light, darkness, and stunning cinematography by Jarin Blaschke should be reason enough for anyone to see this film. "
"Jul 25, 2023",positive," Violent and powerful from start to finish, The Northman tells an epic, period accurate Viking tale that easily immerses its audience throughout the entire run-time. Directed by Robert Eggers, The Northman tells a story of revenge. When Price Amleth's father is brutally murdered by his uncle, Amleth seeks revenge years later when he is a strong, bloodthirsty Viking. He embarks on a journey to save his kidnapped mother, kill his uncle and avenge his father.  Viking tales are popular amongst regular movie goers and casual watchers alike, and luckily, The Northman's story excels. It is bloody, brutal and violent from the get-go, and isn't afraid to shock its audience. There is action aplenty to keep you invested, yet also a great amount of quieter moments that allow us to get to know our characters better with thorough development. We follow Amleth from a boy to a man, and are able to root for him regardless of his flaws and thirst for blood. It's a wild ride full of fighting, violence, death, revenge, love, witchcraft and even a couple of twists and turns along the way. It is likely to impress many. The movies most admirable aspect is undoubtedly its visuals. The cinematography is simply stunning from start to finish, with excellent attention to detail in regards to framing, use of lighting and colour. Each and every shot appears to be meticulously crafted, a trait that can always be found in an Eggers flick. It makes for a highly immersive experience, especially when paired with the enchanting original score from Sebastian Gainsborough. The costume and set design brings everything together harmoniously, creating a feast for the ears and eyes. It's artistic flair is commendable. With a cast this stacked, the amount of excellent performances was not a surprise. Nicole Kidman is a scene stealer as Queen Gudrun, mother of Amleth who was kidnapped by her late husbands brother. Though her screen-time is minimal, she packs a punch with her mesmerising performance. Anya Taylor-Joy excels as Olga of the Birch Forest, a slave who becomes a love interest for our lead, and exhibits so much emotion throughout her scenes. Claes Bang also impresses as villain Fjolnir the Brotherless, the target of our leads thirst for revenge. However, it is Alexander Skarsgard who shines the brightest in his lead role as Amleth. He exudes the strength and determination of his character, never letting the audience doubt his craft. He truly becomes Amleth, giving a career best performance. Other notable performances include those from Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawke and Oscar Novak. Due to Eggers previous directorial work with 2015's The VVitch and 2019's The Lighthouse, it's safe to say he had a lot to live up to, The Northman making its way to many film fans 'Most Anticipated' lists. Though this is his first attempt at a blockbuster-esque movie that takes a break from the horror genre, his artistic flair runs through every scene and it is undeniably Eggers. He is known for his excellent visuals, tension building and unique story-telling, and though The Northman may be his most accessible to date, it stays true to all his best traits. Eggers has once again created a phenomenal movie that is a testament to his talent, and the edge away from horror shows he may have many more strings to his bow. He is without a doubt one of the most exciting film-makers working today. To summarise, The Northman is something special. It deserves to be seen on the big screen by as large an audience as possible. With its intriguing and engrossing storyline, phenomenal acting performances, gorgeous visuals and flawless directing, it is extremely difficult to find a fault. Its brutal and violent in the best way possible yet precisely artistically crafted, including something for blockbuster fans, Viking enthusiasts and those who enjoy the finer aspects of cinema."
"Jul 25, 2023",negative,"The Northman is a story that’s been told many times over, and save for showcasing the stunning scenery of Ireland, this adaptation is nothing to write home about."
"Jul 21, 2023",positive," It’s the question that Robert Eggers’ The Northman contends with right from the start of his $90-million historical epic. Few directors can command the financial means to explore carnal and macabre depictions of Nordic mythology, let alone have the privilege of top-billed performers like Nicole Kidman mouthing Old English lines for the sake of historical accuracy. Fortunately for Eggers, the expressionistic period horror of The Witch and the transgressive eroticism of The Lighthouse have given him carte blanche to craft a high-octane adventure that puts other studio films to shame. An entirely different beast from his previous two films, The Northman isn’t trying to elevate horror nor dismantle fetishistic fantasies. It’s a fully-formed exercise in realigning blockbuster pictures back to the way they should be: big, visually breathtaking, and bolstered by a unique vision. “Broadly appealing” is less an insult towards the film but more towards its association with the homogenized cinematic climate it cuts through. It’s easy to interpret a lack of finesse when the story’s distant relative is Hamlet, and the action looks replicated from other tentpole setpieces (and even television, see Game of Thrones long-shots), but these evaluations overlook the attention to detail unique to this film, which is sorely lacking in committee-constructed films. In an attempt to strike a balance in said cinematic climate, Eggers mentioned that he had Gladiator and Braveheart in mind. He reportedly had to re-edit the final cut so as not to “require a master’s degree in Viking history” when watching. The result is a merging of two worlds: the slow and meticulous pace of arthouse films and the mind-numbing excess of mainstream action. It’s a well-rounded meal that everybody can chew on, making it liable to some lows but also some unimaginably high highs. Alexander Skarsgård plays Prince Amleth, son of King Aurvandill (played by Ethan Hawke) and heir to the kingdom’s throne. At a young age, he witnesses his father’s murder at the hands of Fjölnir (played by Claes Bang), the king’s brother. This prompts Amleth to flee from his home, pledging to exact revenge on the usurper, save his mother Gudrún (played by Nicole Kidman), and fulfill what was foretold to him by the king’s jester, Heimir (played by Willem Dafoe). In what feels like the film’s most overly-edited sequence, the initial set-up is surprisingly breezed through, leaving little room to linger on the above-stated characters. It isn’t a surprise that the following scene is a bloodbath filled with ambitious tracking shots and expert choreography. The action sequence is a microcosm of Jarin Blaschke’s ambitious cinematography and his ability to match the brooding atmosphere of the Icelandic legend. There are many flavors to the film’s milieu, sometimes dredged in greys and blues, and other times only lit by the orange emanating from the natural fire. It’s probably not contentious to say that this is a beautiful-looking film. Years later, as a berserker, Amleth finds himself ravaging towns along with fellow Vikings. He encounters Olga (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), one of the Slavic slaves occupying the land of the Rus. She offers an alternative life to the vengeful prince, a breath of normalcy, and a return to the ordinary world in hero’s journey terms. Besides that, Taylor-Joy offers little to the table and is relegated to her primal attributes of benevolence and mysticism, traits which are undoubtedly faithful to the legend but unsubstantiated for modern standards. Björk also returns after 17 years removed from acting to play a Seeress who prophesizes Amleth’s revenge in a brief yet eerie sequence.  The film’s highlight is Skarsgård’s forceful turn in the lead role, but an underrated aspect is the vulnerability he allows to feed into his performance. Amleth is a dirtied character, unflinching in the face of mud and blood and blinded by the viciousness of fate. Each guttural scream from him is accompanied by a contemplative search for purpose, a push and pull between a vengeful life and a free one. He decides to be chained as a means of confronting his now exiled uncle and witnessing the noble life snatched from him. One can palpably sense the longing and despair that has defined his adulthood. Skarsgård plays the part with the temerity of a ruthless wolf, but hiding underneath the headdress is a broken child who is alone in the world.  Sjón, an Icelandic novelist, joins Eggers in writing the script, which is every bit a play in the same way Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth was — but on steroids. One of the creative liberties they took on for the Nordic story is the inclusion of a werewolf-inspired coming of age ritual inside a bleak cavern, and it plays out as bizarrely as it sounds. The in-world mythology has a serene, matter-of-fact quality to it, as though visions of arterial family trees and blue-eyed warriors riding horses to Valhalla were commonplace in this universe. It’s part of the script’s charm and, by extension, the visual language that translates it."
"Jul 21, 2023",positive," Synopsis: From visionary director Robert Eggers comes The Northman, an action-filled epic that follows a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father’s murder. Although he doesn’t have many films under his belt, three at this point, Robert Eggers has established himself as one of the most unique and distinctive voices of this new generation of filmmakers (along with Julia Ducournau, Ari Aster, Anna Biller, amongst others). His features use a motley mixture of symbolic imagery and stalking horror along with the faithful periodic details (including dialect, costumes, and richly layered folk-tale narratives) to create terrifying and memorable pieces. One of the reasons his films are so compelling and alluring may be his obsession with research–he peruses and scrutinizes various texts, lexicons, and dissertations of the era, along with scriptures of actual lived experiences. Eggers quotes: “If I can’t experience what I write as my own memories, it can’t be truthful.” This fixation benefits his features, as he brings the historical worldviews of a lost time to modern audiences in artistically bewitching and atmospheric ways. I even consider his debut, The Witch, to be close to being a masterpiece. It creates a thick atmosphere of dread and conveys the themes of blind religious convictions, unlike any picture I have seen in the past decades. I’m not the biggest fan of his follow-up, The Lighthouse; however, I admire most of its cinematic minutiae, artistic corpus, and concepts. Now, for his third project, he partners up with Icelandic author and screenwriter Sjón (who also, fun fact, has performed with Björk and The Sugarcubes as Johnny Triumph) to deliver an interpretation of the legend of Amleth, who’s a preeminent figure in medieval Scandinavian mythology. The Northman centers around the prominent figure (Alexander Skarsgård), the direct inspiration of the character Prince Hamlet, who was once set to govern the kingdom his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), oversaw and reigned over. After a fierce battle, the King and his kin embrace and celebrate throughout the evening. Once the nighttime arrives, the two go to a forest close by to perform a rite, with the help of the fool Heimir (Willem Dafoe), that will bond the father-son relationship into something worth more, an affinity between kings.  There is only one primordial condition to this ritual between the fire: if the worst tends to happen and the King perishes amidst battle, Amleth must avenge his death. And the worst indeed occurs when his father is pitilessly murdered by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). And his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), was kidnapped by the same people who performed the ruthless act. From that point on, he escapes on a rowboat out to sea and swears: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Two decades later, Amleth–now a Viking who raids several Slavic villages–receives a vision from a seeress (Björk, with a brief yet fascinating scene). She reminds him of his oath to the gods about exacting retribution for his royal progenitors. Because an act of violence and callousness reminds him of what happened to him, he conceals himself as a slave in a ship headed towards his false-hearted uncle’s new estate; Fjölnir’s perfidious act led to complete dismissal and exile.  As they make their way to the new domain, Amleth meets and romantically bonds with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a young sorceress who is willing to help him pursue retribution. In the estate, Amleth builds trust with Fjölnir and his loyal companions so that, when the time is right, he can strike his mighty sword against him and get vindication for his family name. Beautifully and carefully crafted by Eggers and company, The Northman takes the Norse myth that inspired Hamlet and makes it into a mesmerizingly ambitious and brutal revenge tale. Although there is a large kill count and garners its plentiful buckets of crimson red splattered around the muddy terrains, the film is about the tolls savagery takes on a person’s life choices and vitality–a nihilistic account of the everlasting succession of barbarity and brutality. There are several scenes in which Amleth rethinks his actions due to the visceral carnage caused by his influence (as he ransacks villages) or by others (the killings of his own people).  This then juxtaposes with the moralities and principles of the different types of people we see throughout the film: Vikings, kings, queens, sorceresses, ordinary folk, and the enslaved. This is a theme that comes back from Eggers’ previous features; however, in this case, it isn’t about religious convictions or the edges of sanity, but the cycle of violence. There’s also the dissimilitude between the male and female characters. Regarding the male characters, Eggers is fascinated by portraying the human body in all its ugliness (even though Skarsgård delivers a muscular berserker performance, harnessing the spirit of an apex predator while showcasing his washboard abs). There’s burping and farting (like Pattinson and Dafoe’s drunken ramblings in The Lighthouse) as the signs of manhood and bonding between the men. Yet, at the same time, we see their bodies abused and defiled as if humanity is meant to suffer for eternity. This helps to make The Northman not only a compelling watch but a challenging and hurting one as well (in a good way, of course). You can sense the physicality of the sword swings or the punches thrown during the fights.  On the other side of things, the women (and womanhood) are treated esoterically or mystical-esque–almost sacred. However, the movie doesn’t expand upon these characteristics as much as one would like to. However, thanks to Kidman and Taylor-Joy’s acting chops, this flaw is overcome mostly, but not completely. The other minor issues that the film contains have to do with its final emotional pull and its cold demeanor. Like most Shakespearian play adaptations or other similar works, there will be many who already know the grand scheme of things (not the brilliant final battle but its conclusion). That wasn’t the problem; the problem was that its ending overall isn’t as emotionally enthralling as one might expect, nor does it reach the thematic richness of The Witch’s finale. When compared, it feels a bit smaller. Nonetheless, you are in awe of Eggers’ directorial abilities, most specifically because this is a grander scope, with a budget of 75 million dollars (thanks to Focus Features for giving such an innovative auteur a big bag of cash to realize his visions).  Most of The Northman’s elements are exquisitely detailed (the costume design by Linda Muir and Louise Cassettari, Craig Lathrop’s production design, and the entire sound team) to take you back to the bestial 10th century. In addition, the work of cinematographer Jarin Blaschke is pretty darn good. The way he shoots the film’s action set pieces is outstanding. He lets them breathe and develop slowly with tracking shots so the viewer can be way more immersed in the story. Blaschke also isn’t afraid to let the camera linger in front of the actor’s faces so we can sense every emotion the characters are going through. There is a lot to admire in Eggers’ latest, and it’s possible that, with a rewatch, you could appreciate the details more and analyze the themes in-depth. The reflections of the cycles of violence passed down from generation to generation is a fascinating concept, and Eggers finds a way to balance feral entertainment with simplistic scenes of dramatic heft. The studio interference comments that appeared a few days ago don’t seem like much happened; it doesn’t appear to have narrowed his vision, as it has his stamp all over the 137-minute runtime. By the time the end credits hit, you will be waiting for it to begin anew, and that is one of the highest compliments you could give a movie of this size and breadth. "
"May 9, 2023",positive," Alexander Skarsgård leads a stellar cast in Robert Eggers’ latest, The Northman, which provides all the weirdness, gore, beauty and singularity that you would expect from this director’s take on a Viking tale of vengeance. It’s a classic Eggers equation, adding together (met) expectations of his stylised and violent version of an historic epic with rabid commitment from his actors, which certainly equals a movie with undeniable power – whether it’s to everyone’s tastes or not. On only his third feature-length film, following The Witch and The Lighthouse, it’s impressive that the writer and director already has a distinguishable-enough style that audiences can know what to expect and strap themselves in accordingly. However, for every horror fan that thrills at the (literal) gut-spilling and decapitation, as well as repeatedly bizarre religious rituals around bonfires, there are others less enraptured by his bold vision, which does have a tendency towards indulgence at moments. With young Viking prince Amleth (played ably by Oscar Novak before Skarsgård) at its heart, The Northman follows the youngster’s growth as he flees his home following the murder of his father King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Powered by his own personal motto to avenge (his father’s death), save (his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman)) and kill (his treacherous uncle), Amleth returns years later to carry out his plan. The Northman’s great cast lives up to what you’d hope from such starry and suitably Scandinavian-heavy billing. Everyone has whole-heartedly embraced the intensity Eggers likes to draw out from his actors (sometimes it’s exhausting simply watching), even if it’s only little snippets of delightful bizarreness we’re treated to from Björk and Eggers returner Willem Dafoe. Claes Bang is a worthy adversary to Skarsgård, with the irresistible suave charm he had as Dracula for the BBC in 2020 replaced by steely aggression, while Nicole Kidman has a properly meaty role in which to sink her teeth. Anya Taylor-Joy also returns to an Eggers’ role, after leading 2015’s The Witch, once again lending her ethereal beauty and delicate touch to the part of tough-as-nails slave Olga. However, the film rests mainly, and comfortably, on Skarsgård’s massive shoulders. Dialling it up to what can only be described as beast mode for a fair chunk of the film, he has the physique, presence and (Swedish) pedigree for it, and we’ve seen him show off his brand of almost noble savagery before in spades in his international break-through role on vampire show True Blood. Although a more accessible film than The Lighthouse, sharing a similar ability with The Witch to ground itself in the history and faith of its setting, The Northman does lean heavily into its weird rituals and visions, alongside the dark violence of Viking gore, which is exactly where you’d expect to find Eggers. The Northman’s chuckles are few and far between due to its near-unrelenting grimness, although odd moments of light relief are peppered in – consider yourself warned if you don’t think you’ll be in the mood for a man having his freshly chopped-off head placed up his a**e.

"May 9, 2023",positive," In Matt Reeves’ The Batman, Robert Pattinson tries out “I’m vengeance” as The Caped Crusader’s latest cinematic catchphrase. In Robert Eggers’ The Northman, Alexander Skarsgård’s Prince Amleth takes it up a few notches, preparing himself in the style of Kill Bill’s Beatrix Kiddo and Gladiator’s Maximus Decimus Meridius for a roaring rampage of bloody, gladiatorial revenge on his nasty uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang, whose character is soon enough “Fjölnir the Brotherless”). Loosely inspired by the medieval Scandinavian legend that gave birth to William Shakespeare’s famous and tragic Dane (Hamlet), The Northman — despite a whopping budget that started at an estimated 65 million and finished closer to 90 million — is not likely to see the same kind of box office receipts enjoyed by Reeves’ 2022 blockbuster. Even so, one marvels that in Eggers’ short career he has been able to accomplish that rare feat: the delivery of auteurist visions immediately recognizable for meticulous period details and a commitment to uncompromising storytelling craft. The Northman also retains the filmmaker’s deep respect for the weird and the uncanny. Both The Witch and The Lighthouse (93 and 109 minutes to the 137 of Eggers’ 2022 film) are weirder and more uncanny, however, due in no small part to their closer proximity to the horror genre. The Northman has a few tricks up its sleeve, but Amleth’s mantra — “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir” — is indeed the essence of the plot. Eggers — writing this time with Icelandic lyricist, poet, novelist and performer Sjón — plays it straighter and safer than expected. A key twist cracks the door to a stunning possibility that should lead Amleth to ask himself a variant of another Pattinson-affiliated meme staple: “What if I’m the bad guy?” Had Eggers and Sjón focused on the intricacies and complexities of that idea, The Northman’s inevitable climactic duel — a spectacular, one-on-one, Gates of Hel holmgång visually reminiscent of Obi-Wan’s dismantling of Vader alongside the lava flows of Mustafar — might have delivered something unforgettable. The Northman has much to recommend it. Even though Björk’s part is small and not especially significant, fans can rightfully cheer the big screen return of the Icelandic musician, absent (with the exception of Drawing Restraint 9) since she paid the price to an abusive Lars von Trier in Dancer in the Dark more than two decades ago. Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga of the Birch Forest adds enough promise to make one wish the movie was called “The Northwoman,” while Willem Dafoe’s holy fool Heimir is better than any CG effect. And I just can’t stop thinking about the striking orthodontics or dental adornments worn by the screaming shield maiden. Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor’s Arden Shakespeare edition of Hamlet claims the story is second only to “Cinderella” as the world’s most-filmed, although the flood of Dracula variants, Sherlock Holmes iterations and versions of A Christmas Carol are in the conversation. Eggers has joked that his long-gestating remake of Nosferatu could be cursed by the ghost of F. W. Murnau, but I hope he gets to it in the near future. The Northman’s carefully choreographed, single-shot takes and startlingly lit close-ups — designed in collaboration with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke — blow the spatially disorienting and over-edited style of so many contemporary action films completely out of the fjord. Greg Carlson (@gcarlson1972) is a professor of communication studies and the director of the interdisciplinary film studies minor program at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota. He is also the film editor of the High Plains Reader, where his writing has appeared since 1997."
"Feb 18, 2023",positive," The Northman is practically bursting with testosterone. The story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Viking Prince hellbent on revenge, Robert Eggers‘s third film is essentially a case study in the destructive nature of unyielding masculinity. True to form, Eggers’s attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking and the meticulous director transports us to the Viking Age, a time when physical strength was synonymous with survival. But despite its singular title, The Northman is also filled with complex female characters subverting its rigid power structure. Three women, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and a mystical Seeress (Björk) all play pivotal roles in Amleth’s destiny, a battle with his sworn enemy on an Icelandic volcano. Eggers’s film may focus on the male obsession with dominance and destruction, but he juxtaposes this theme with the so-called “mysteries of women,” the intellect needed to navigate a world based on physical power. The men of The Northman live and die based on the strength of their bodies, but its women survive by the strength of their cunning. Queen Gudrún’s introductory line is a harbinger for the dark road ahead. As her excited son brings news of the King’s return, she delivers a sharp warning that he is never to enter her chamber without an invitation. Quickly softening, she expresses both love for her husband and concern for her son, whom she worries is not yet old enough to take over the kingdom. In the midst of Fjölnir’s coup, a disguised Amleth watches the conqueror carry his screaming mother through the village and declare her his new bride. Incapable of saving her, he is forced to leave her behind. Queen Gudrún has now become the damsel in distress he must rescue and his inability to do so will haunt him for the rest of his life. Years later, an adult Amleth has been adopted into a viking clan raiding the Land of Rus. After brutally conquering a village, he wanders into the ruins of a temple and encounters a blind Seeress with a galvanizing prophecy. She reminds him of his long ago oath and places in his hand a symbol of the tear he shed in the fragility of his childhood. Essentially shaming him for his weakness, she tells him it’s not enough to simply be strong. He must demonstrate his strength by conquering the man who once stole his power. She also foretells of a Maiden King who will play a role in his destiny, but once again, he has no interest in the female element of his fortune. Though we learn little of her origins, the Seeress first identifies Amleth as a slayer of her people and brother to the men who took her eyes. Perhaps she views her spiritual knowledge as a tool to emasculate him as revenge for her suffering. Powerless in the face of a strong enemy, she defends herself by reminding Amleth of his weakness and sending him off on a path of destruction.  Amleth finds the perfect opportunity to resume his quest with the shipment of slaves his clan has just captured. They are bound for the homestead of Fjölnir the Brotherless, now living in Iceland after losing his stolen kingdom to another conqueror. Amleth poses as a slave and sneaks aboard the ship. With no kingdom to fight for, his mission is now solely personal. Assuming his mother has merely been feigning love for the man who kidnapped her, he seeks to save her and reassert himself as the conquering hero. Though he likely sees his quest as altruistic, he is ultimately attempting to assuage the guilt he carries from leaving her behind as a child.  Aboard the ship, Amleth meets Olga of the Birch Forest, a captured maiden from the village he’s just conquered. Known as a spell-speaker, she practices a feminine Earth magic and vows to free herself through cunning. Though Olga asks for his help, Amleth soon learns that she is more than capable of defending herself. She resists Fjölnir’s unwanted advances by lifting her skirts to show that she is menstruating and wiping the blood in his face. She poisons the stew with mushrooms causing the “black dreams’’ that allow Amleth to wreak further havoc. Impressed with her bravery and spiritual knowledge, he asks about her practice. Olga tells him that her magic will stoke the flames of his sword and that the thread of her fate now entwines with his. Her flexibility stands in contrast to his rigid obsession. While Olga is content to listen to the Earth and follow her cues, Amleth will destroy anything that stands in the way of his chosen fate.  Amleth soon learns that the mysteries of women may have more bearing on his destiny than he once believed. On the eve of his vengeance, he confronts Gudrún with his true identity. Hoping for a joyful reunion, he instead learns a devastating truth. She was part of the plot to kill Amleth’s father. A slave stolen from a village very much like Olga’s, Gudrún was claimed and assaulted by King Aurvandil and Amleth is the product of a coupling she describes as savagery. She truly loves Fjölnir and was not screaming but laughing on the day in which he freed her from his brother’s control. Even worse, she is the one who demanded Amleth’s head. Seeing her first son as a product of her trauma, she ordered his death to destroy all reminders of her painful past. Mother and son now find themselves in opposition. He threatens the happy life she’s finally found, and she is one of the murders he’s sworn to kill.  Finally reckoning with the mysteries of women, Amleth is forced to confront the lie on which he’s based his life. Without the strength to physically dominate, the women who surround him have used cunning to align themselves with a strong protector. Gudrún found Fjölnir just as Olga found Amleth. Though both women genuinely love their chosen partners, these relationships likely began as necessary manipulation in search of powerful shelter. The Seeress gets her revenge by playing on Amleth’s fear and distracting him with the memory of his inadequacy. The women of The Northman survive by embracing their perceived weakness and using them as a cover to manipulate the minds of men obsessed with strength.  Ethics and nobility have very little place in this world and Gudrún and Olga must align themselves with the best bet for their own survival. Amleth is our hero because he is the lens through which we view the story, but he is a member of a Viking raid that slaughters villagers and burns children alive. The father he idolizes returns to his kingdom with slaves captured from a village he conquered on his voyage. The amulet he gives his son was taken from the neck of another prince, presumably after his murder. Though Fjölnir is presented as a villain, Gudrún sees him as a liberator, having freed her from a life with Aurvandil. But Fjölnir is a conqueror as well. He attempts to rape Olga and only backs down because she offends him. Neither heroes or villains, these men are simply a product of their destructive environment and the pillars through which the women must navigate. Interpretations of Eggers’ intended message may vary, but his fiery conclusion demonstrates the futility of Amleth’s quest. He does achieve his revenge, beheading Fjölnir next to a stunning lake of fire, but he is mortally wounded in the process. Both men fall to the ground, finally victims of the violence that has dominated their lives. Amleth dies on the battlefield, a highly prized end that guarantees him passage into Valhöll, the majestic afterlife for slain warriors. Though Amleth has achieved his stated goal, an alternate interpretation shows that he’s thrown his life away on a meaningless prophecy. Failing to understand the mysteries of women, he’s dedicated his life to saving a mother who does not want to be rescued, avenging a lecherous king, and murdering the man who actually saved his mother.  Pregnant with Amleth’s twins, Olga is now the sole survivor of his prophecy and bearer of his family’s line. Given her dedication to a more nurturing faith, perhaps she can steer his descendants away from obsessive destruction in a more sustainable direction. Her daughter will be the Maiden King that prophecy foretold and, with her mother’s guidance, will have the opportunity to reject the world of violence so prized by her ancestors. With her Earth magic, Olga will teach her children to embrace the constructive threads of their lives wherever they may lead.  A new breed of creature-features was unleashed in the 1990s and continued well into the next decade. Shaking off the ecological messaging of the past, these monsters existed for the sake of pure mayhem. Just to name a few: Tremors, The Relic, Anaconda, Godzilla, Deep Rising and Lake Placid all showcased this trend of irreverent creature chaos. Reptiles and other scaly beasts proved to be a popular source of inspiration for these films, but for that extra crawly experience, bugs were the best and quickest route. Spiders, in particular, led some of the worst infestations on screen in the early 2000s. And on the underbelly of this creeping new wave — specifically the direct-to-video sector — hangs an overlooked offering of spider horror: Arachnid. In 2000, Brian Yuzna and Julio Fernández launched the Spanish production company Fantastic Factory. The Filmax banner’s objective was to create modestly budgeted genre films for international distribution. And while they achieved their goal — a total of nine English-language films were produced and shipped all across the globe — Fantastic Factory ultimately closed up shop after only five years. Arachnid, directed by Jack Sholder (Alone in the Dark, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge, The Hidden) and based on a script by Mark Sevi, was the second project from the short-lived genre house. Yuzna was drawn to the concept largely because of its universal appeal; a monster was marketable in any region, regardless of cultural preferences or restrictions. There was also the fact that spiders give everyone a case of the heebie-jeebies. By having extraterrestrial forces be the cause of the spiders’ mutism and immensity as well as other urgent problems within the story, Arachnid incidentally pays respect to Hollywood’s golden age of schlock filmmaking. The opening sequence indeed shows a stealth plane’s pilot (Jesús Cabrero) trailing a UFO and its translucent passenger to an island in the South Pacific, but the alien business is kept to a minimum going forward. There is no time to process this seismic revelation of life beyond Earth before moving on to the film’s central plot.  Several months since the E.T. was last sighted — and after being snuffed out by one of its own accidental creations — a medical team from Guam heads to Celebes (better known as Sulawesi nowadays), in search of whatever is behind a new illness. The doctors (played by José Sancho and Neus Asensi) already suspected a spider bite, although they failed to consider the biter could be the size of a tank. With The Descent’s Alex Reid as the snarky pilot of this doomed expedition, one who has ulterior motives for accepting the job, the film’s core characters go off in search of a spider and, hopefully, a cure. The title makes it seem as if there is only the one arachnid in the story, but once Chris Potter and Reid’s characters plus their team step foot on the island, they encounter other altered arthropods. Yuzna felt Sevi’s script needed more creatures along the way, especially before the spider showed up in full view. The bug horror commences as one gunsman succumbs to a burrowing breed of crab-sized ticks, and random characters fend off a horrific centipede with reptilian qualities. These are just the appetizers before the greatest arachnid of them all arrives. The late Ravil Isyanov, here playing a zealous but sympathetic arachnologist, becomes a human Lunchable for the spider’s eggs. And one of the doctors gets a face full of corrosive spider spew. So, there is no shortage of grisly predation in the film, with a few bits of the monsters’ handiwork possessing a haunting quality to them. Shot quickly and cheaply, Arachnid is fast-food horror. It’s convenient and designed for immediate consumption, and will likely not linger on the palate. Usually there is not a lot worth remembering with these slapdash genre productions, however, this is one case of spider horror where the extra effort made a difference. Apart from the egregious use of digital imagery in the outset, Jack Sholder’s film primarily employs practical effects. And these are not rubber spiders dangling from strings or being flung at the actors, either. Fantastic Factory aimed much higher by securing DDTSFX (Pan’s Labyrinth, Hellboy II: The Golden Army) and creature designer and makeup artist Steve Johnson (Species, Blade II). Arachnid, while far from flawless, somewhat redeems itself by having chosen practical effects and animatronics over CGI, which had become the new normal in these kinds of films. And this class of creature-feature was definitely not getting the sort of advanced VFX found in the likes of Eight Legged Freaks. Steve Johnson’s spider was not the easiest prop to work with, and it lacks the movement and versatility of a digital depiction. However, there is no beating that sense of weight and occupation of space that makes a tangible monster more intimidating. Viewers will have trouble recalling the human characters long after watching Arachnid, yet the humongous headliner remains the stuff of nightmares. Over the years, the director has spoken critically of the film. He originally held off on agreeing to the offer to direct in hopes that another project, a Steven Seagal picture, would finally manifest. No such luck, and Sholder accepted Arachnid only on account of his needing the work. He said of the film: “I thought I could […] make it halfway decent, but I discovered there wasn’t a whole lot I could do.” Nevertheless, Sholder’s experience as a director of not exactly high-brow yet still rather entertaining horror is evident in what he has since called a “dud.” While there is no denying the reality and outcome of Arachnid, even the most mediocre films have their strokes of brilliance, small as they may be."
"Dec 26, 2022",neutral,"Northman is one of Robert Egger best films. The scope, the scale, the atmospheric building of Norse mythology is groundbreaking. Along with some insanely well acted performances and beyond thrilling action and revenge based story. Must Watch Masterpiece!"
"Dec 4, 2022",positive,The Northman creates a unique saga that taps into something truly primal before one hell of an ending.
"Oct 11, 2022",positive," Epic, all-encompassing filmmaking unlike anything seen in  theatres today, The Northman tells its story of brutal revenge with a  potent blend of Scandinavian mythology, sword-swinging action, and  Shakespearean dramatics.  Based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth (which in turned  inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet), The Northman blends the brute of John  Milius’ Conan the Barbarian and the mysticism of John Boorman’s Excalibur in a Viking movie that is as much about old-world religion as it is a tale of  revenge, in which questing warrior Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) receives help  in the form of three witches who foretell prophecies of destiny. Swearing vengeance upon the head of his uncle Fjohir  (Claes Bang) for the murder of his father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan  Hawke) and enslavement of his mother Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), the hulking  Amleth schemes his way into Fjohir’s isolated isle village where he dispatches his  enemies with extreme prejudice. The Northman is a film as strange as it is engrossing,  the use of Norse mysticism creating a world ancient in spirit and brutal in violence.  Filmed in varied locations in Northern Ireland, The Republic of Ireland, and  Iceland, director Robert Eggars along with cinematographer John Blaschke (The  Lighthouse) capture the greys, the mist, and the ancient landscapes  upon which this tale of mysticism and destiny take place. Skarsgard delivers one of his best turns yet as Amleth, blending  hulking brutality with moments of introspection as he encounters supernatural  elements beyond his comprehension, along with the legacy of a kingdom savagely  taken from him. Good too is Anya-Taylor Joy as Olga of the Birch Forest, a  soothsayer and slave who finds love and solace in Amleth’s arms. Ethan Hawke  and Willem Dafoe leave an impression in minor roles, especially Dafoe who takes  his penchant for portraying strange characters to new grimacing heights.  Eggers, who previously impressed with The Witch and The Lighthouse, has forever changed the Viking film with The  Northman, an intoxicating and epic blend of violence, mysticism, and  breathtaking visuals that establishes the presence of a heavyweight filmmaker whose  distinctive vision is needed now more than ever. "
"Oct 3, 2022",positive," If you love “Hamlet” but you’ve always thought the ending was too upbeat, then “The Northman” is the movie for you. Spectacle, pageantry and myth combine with blood, mud and abs for a dazzling, uproarious Viking spree in which Alexander Skarsgård seeks to avenge the murder of his father with the aid of Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Queen’s Gambit”) and Icelandic national treasure Björk.  Robert Eggers (“The Lighthouse”) brings to life the Norse legend that also inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” that of prince Amleth, who is robbed of his birthright when his father, the king, is murdered by his own brother. The murderous Fjölnir (Claes Bang) claims not only his brother’s crown but his queen (Nicole Kidman) as well. The young prince narrowly escapes his uncle’s wrath and is presumed dead, but when we meet him again years later, he is all grown up into a revenge-seeking Viking, ruthless, bloodthirsty, well-trained and handy with an ax.  Ethan Hawke plays the doomed King Aurvandil, and the film’s first scenes are vital to the emotional core of the film, which threatens at times to get lost in gore. Vital to the story is a long sequence with young Amleth and Aurvandil in a trippy ceremony led by Willem Dafoe, who you absolutely want as your spirit guide through any ancient Nordic hallucinogenic journeys in which you connect with your ancestors and your fate. This ceremony bonds young Amleth to the father he reveres, and Hawke’s presence, although brief on screen, is felt throughout the rest of the film. Without this well-established emotional connection, Amleth’s bloody adventures would have felt meaningless. Any one of the elements of wild action, fabulous fantasy or high drama could have outweighed the other at any point, but Eggers keeps things in balance throughout the film’s lengthy run time. The characters are archetypes from ancient lore, but grounding moments bring them alive as people who we care about. Kidman was particularly effective as Queen Gudrun, from whom we do not hear much for at least half of the film. When the long-sought-after reunion between mother and son takes place, she unleashes a stunning onslaught of emotion, and Kidman is electrifying, subverting expectations of maternity, to say the least. But the real reason to watch “The Northman” is because of how it looks. Eggers develops the stylized sensibility of his earlier films on a grand scale here, reveling in the visual spectacle of vast Icelandic mountains, swiftly flowing rivers (of both blood and water), forests, intestines, fire, birds and much more. Recurring visions are rendered gorgeously, turning this ancient myth, which was eventually translated into “Hamlet,” one of the cornerstones of the Western canon, into a moving illuminated manuscript.  Contemporary bodies tell a tale you read in your English class and — similar to the even trippier, recent “The Green Knight” adaptation — this film does not feel old-fashioned in the slightest. It is highly accessible but never anachronistic. A visceral and vivid dreamscape of an action film, “The Northman” delivers if you like to see people fighting but want to feel intellectual about it. It’s a fascinating historical myth that also happens to have a bloody, heavy-metal heart. “Top Gun: Maverick”: After more than 30 years of service as one of the U.S. Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission, the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick’s late friend and radar intercept officer, Lt. Nick “Goose” Bradshaw.

"Sep 24, 2022",positive," King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) returns to his kingdom with the bounties of war. He greets his wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and gifts his young son Amleth (Oscar Novak) with a trinket that he had pillaged. It’s a gift fit for a man, not a young boy, and the starting point for Amleth’s journey into manhood. The King has returned from war grievously injured and he refuses to succumb to injuries or die as a “grey beard.” He will die in battle and before he does, he wants to ensure that his son is ready for the duties that will be bestowed upon him upon his death. In these early scenes of The Northman, Robert Eggers sets the stage for a visceral, otherworldly exploration of Norse mythology and religion. The King and Amleth venture into a smoke-filled inner sanctum where Heimir the Fool (Willem Defoe) acts as their guide, summoning the spirits of their ancestors and their descendants to help with this passage from boyhood into manhood. But it’s the tragedy that follows that launches Amleth onto a different path, one marred with pain, vengeance, and obsession. When they depart from Heimir, King War-Raven is slaughtered by his bastard half-brother Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) and the Queen is taken. Amleth barely escapes with his life, though given the trajectory that he is set upon, the vengeance that consumes his life, perhaps a part of him died that day. With the young boy’s vow to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir, The Northman moves forward in time until Amleth (now Alexander Skarsgård) is a grown man and an active and willing participant in the pillaging and plundering of neighboring villages. It’s violent, bloodthirsty, animalistic, and true to the history of the Vikings. The men don wolf pelts, beating their chests, howling at the moon, drinking herbed wine (laced with, presumably, hallucinogenic mushrooms), sending them straight into Berserker mode. It’s here, in this half-slaughtered village, that Amleth first encounters Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), whose striking white-blond hair sets her apart from the rest of the villagers. As they are rounding up the villagers to ship off as slaves, Amleth learns that they are destined to be delivered to the farm that Fjölnir has made for himself after being ousted by another king. He seizes this opportunity, cutting his hair and branding himself as a slave to be sent to Fjölnir. On the journey to Fjölnir’s, Olga recognizes him as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but they form a connection that perseveres, even in the worst of times. Upon his arrival, Amleth discovers that his mother has remained with Fjölnir and they have had a son together. She seems, at least to outside observers, to be happy. Both as a wife and as a mother to Fjölnir’s eldest son, Thórir the Proud (Gustav Lindh) and their son Gunnar (Elliott Rose). While he could take swift action and avenge his father, Amleth paces himself. There is trust to earn, slaves to free, seeds to sow, and uncomfortable truths to uncover. Olga is presented to him as an alternative path for his life, a deviation from a life filled with vengeance, hatred, and self-isolation. She is gentle and kind, but deadly in her own right. She is a perfect match for Amleth, willing to fight alongside him for a future together, but ultimately the temptation of Valhalla is too strong. While The Northman does present a shockingly-accurate portrayal of the 9th century, it does employ a healthy dose of “Hollywood magic” to create a compelling and engaging story for the 21st-century audience. While not quite a true story, Amleth is a figure from Scandinavian legends, and the basis for William Shakespeare’s tragedy Hamlet. The connection between the two stories is impossible to ignore—right down to the pointed Oedipus complex. As someone who has spent the better part of her life entranced with the rich wonders of Norse mythology, Eggers is the first to portray Norse spirituality, Valhalla, and figures like the Seeress (Björk) and Halla the Maiden (Rebecca Ineson), with the sort of respect that they are owed. These aren’t Party City Vikings, these are Vikings whose blood, sweat, and tears are palpable. The Seeress and Halla aren’t objects to be desired—these are women designed to be feared and venerated. If The Dig whet your appetite for Viking boat burials, then The Northman will be a feast for the historical soul. With the sweeping, immersive cinematography, and the way in which the film fully embraces the beauty and horror of Nordic history, The Northman is positioned to be Robert Eggers’ best film yet. He leaves no stone unturned, reminding the audiences of how violent, superstitious, and duty-bound the Nordic people were. Eggers’ script, which he co-wrote with Icelandic author Sjón, provides the groundwork for powerful, unexpected storytelling. As raw and masculine as so much of the film is, perhaps to the extreme, even, it’s still focused on the heart of things with a keen, intentional line drawn towards the reverence of the feminine. Skarsgård is utterly transformed by this role, more beast than man in the heat of battle, but still a boy desperate for the love he never received as a child. It’s a tragedy because Amleth was forged by the negligence of the elders around him, shaped into a weapon of vengeance that ultimately brings him swiftly into the gates of Valhalla. But even in the tragedy of it all, there’s a hope that blooms among the leaves of his family tree and the promise that his line will continue, with purposeful emphasis on his daughter. The Northman, coupled with last year’s oft-overlooked The Green Knight, stands as a stark reminder that there is still a place in cinema for gorgeous, inspired odysseys, rife with literary allusions, deep-seated spiritual meanings, and an exploration of complex human emotions. Vengeance is a potent drug, more deadly than any hallucinogenic tonic, Berserker, or rabid dog. It comes in the dark of the night and strikes right at the heart of even the strongest Viking."
"Sep 8, 2022",positive,"This brutally violent, yet soaringly lyrical action epic is quite unlike anything captured on screen before. "
"Sep 1, 2022",positive," The Northman is an epic the likes of which we hardly see in Hollywood anymore, carefully curated by a master of the medium & packed with powerhouse performances. From his very first feature film, it’s been clear that Robert Eggers is a bit of a rulebreaker. Whether it comes to tackling shocking or seemingly taboo subject matter or turning in scripts that are often borderline incomprehensible to those who aren’t well versed in 17th or 19th Century English, there’s no denying that Eggers has quickly established his own signature style in today’s cinematic space (which is no small feat), advancing to become one of the most defining auteurs of the era, who is beholden to no artistic restriction. And, as a result of knocking it out of the park twice in a row with cinephiles and critics with 2016’s The Witch and 2019’s The Lighthouse, Eggers was granted his least creative constraints yet with this year’s The Northman. Along with differing in distribution from his first two films (both of which were distributed by A24, while Northman is in the fine hands of Focus Features), The Northman comes with a $90 million budget – over 20x The Witch’s and 9x The Lighthouse’s – and a runtime of nearly 2 ½ hours, while The Witch and The Lighthouse ran for 93 minutes and 109 minutes, respectively. Since the start, we’ve known that The Northman was going to be a story told on an unprecedented scale for Eggers, but while some artists achieve new professional actualization when their creativity can’t be curbed, others crumble under the pressure of making the jump from indies to blockbusters and meeting studio demands. Luckily, Eggers is no such artist, delivering his best film to date with The Northman – an epic the likes of which we hardly see in Hollywood anymore, carefully curated by a master of the medium. Our chaotic chronicle commences as a young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) awaits the arrival of his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke, of The Before Trilogy and Moon Knight), from war. Injured, Aurvandill confides in his wife and Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, of Big Little Lies and Being the Ricardos) that he must start showing Amleth the ways of the world in preparation of possibly becoming king himself someday soon, with these teachings being relayed by Aurvandill’s friend – and local “fool” – Heimir (Willem Dafoe, of Spider-Man: No Way Home and Aquaman). However, upon leaving their communion, Aurvandill and Amleth are attacked by Fjölnir (Claes Bang, of The Square and The Girl in the Spider’s Web), Aurvandill’s brother and Amleth’s uncle, with the former succumbing to his slaughter and the latter escaping to the ocean, vowing to return to avenge his father and save his mother. Years later, we find that Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, of True Blood and Passing) has taken up with a pack of traveling raiders, abandoning his quest in favor of mindlessly savage and superficial pursuits. But a chance meeting with the Seeress (Björk, of Dancer in the Dark) reminds him of his true purpose, sending him back to his homeland, where he discovers that Fjölnir has lost his family’s kingdom and is now instead a feudal lord, with Gudrún as his wife, who has bore his son. Posing as a slave, Amleth slowly integrates himself into Fjölnir’s feudal community, where he also falls for fellow slave – and sorceress – Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, of The Queen’s Gambit and Last Night in Soho) who shows him an alternative path in life, one defined by hope instead of hurt. Yet can he ever escape the emotional corruption that has consumed him since childhood, or is violence doomed to beget more violence until the end of time? As soon as this story starts, audiences are instantly enraptured by the immensely eerie yet utterly enthralling aesthetic Robert Eggers is so famously known for – combining Jarin Blaschke’s consummate cinematography with staggering sound work from James Boyle, James Harrison, and Steve Little, and Sebastian Gainsborough and Robin Carolan’s striking score – as his trusted crew is not only firing on all cylinders but additionally operating at a higher level than ever before as a result of being given their greatest cinematic canvas yet.  Every shot is a sumptuous masterwork, fully immersing us in these brutal yet oddly beautiful environments, so that we too can see the dawn of the sun as distinctly as Amleth and his fellow slaves or hear the horrific hacking-and-slashing as if such slayings were happening only a few feet away. Few creatives have such a commendable command over the synthesis of cinematic sights and sounds as Robert Eggers does, and that’s the first thing that separates The Northman from similar historical revenge sagas like Braveheart or Gladiator – for starters, none of ‘em look or sound as good as this one. Similarly, though The Northman clearly takes after the set-up of a famous Shakespearean play (Amleth = Hamlet, anyone?), Eggers and co-writer Sjón (Lamb) do enough to differentiate their take on the classic tale (despite Amleth serving as inspiration for the tragedy of Prince Hamlet in the first place) to shape a story that stands on its own. Structurally, the passage of time added between Aurvandill’s passing and Amleth’s revenge serves to make his mission more meaningful and monumental, while an additional character arc for Kidman’s Gudrún (this adventure’s alternate for Hamlet’s Gertrude) and an entirely original character in the form of Taylor-Joy’s love interest Olga not only fine-tune the female players in Amleth’s (*cough* Hamlet’s *cough*) life but also present him with new quandaries to consider. His relationship with Olga in particular is not only conceptually riveting from start-to-finish but ultimately unbearably emotionally resonant, as he’s forced to choose between a potentially prosperous future with her or putting away the pains of his past for good, with ruinous results. Likewise, Eggers and Sjón cleverly complicate Amleth’s crusade to avoid advocating for a message that revenge or violence is in any way rewarding or fulfilling, most notably with tragic third act revelations that completely reframe Amleth’s entire expedition – and existence – up until this point, assuring that every action that follows is accompanied by a piercing prescience indicating that Amleth will never achieve the alleviation from this anguish that he so desires. The two also candidly challenge the suggestion that one’s fate is set in stone, especially via Taylor-Joy’s Olga, as she pleads with Amleth to remember that he has a choice in life and can break this cycle of violence, releasing him and everyone else from this collective enmity. Eggers and Sjón compassionately characterize the viking culture of the era to show what belief systems they subscribe to and why, but they simultaneously establish an engrossing dialogue between tradition and philosophical transformation, making this the rare revenge epic that has more on its mind than murder. Every actor in this exhilarating ensemble is similarly at the top of their game, no matter how many scenes they star in, led by Alexander Skarsgård in an awe-inspiring animalistic turn as the assiduous Amleth, prevailing when it comes to portraying his protagonist’s propulsive physicality but excelling just as efficiently when it comes to his essential emoting in the affecting third act, bringing a greater insight into just how broken this behemoth of a man truly is.  Though most of the movie does center around his titular Northman, every other performer matches his might when asked to contribute their piece to the plot, from Willem Dafoe and Björk with startling near-single-scene performances, to Ethan Hawke’s admirable ardor as King Aurvandill, to Claes Bang’s frigid ferocity as Fjölnir, to Anya Taylor-Joy’s opulent optimism as Olga, and, last but not least, to the glorious Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún, who all but steals the show in one momentous monologue to Skarsgård’s Amleth as things start to head south in the homestretch, uprooting our entire perception of her part in a way only an adept actress as she can do. Stylistically and thematically, The Northman is undeniably Robert Eggers’ crowning achievement as a director to date, with the auteur succeeding at shaping a raucous revenge saga that stirs the soul as much as it stuns one’s senses. Paired with his positively capable cast and crew, Eggers brings this era back to life in fierce fashion, throwing us into a time and place filled with ferality and fatality but not devoid of faith for a better future, delivering a dark depiction of the sobering struggle between fate and free will. After making a name for himself in the indie world and now leveling up to blockbuster fare with ravishing results, it remains to be seen what challenges are left for Robert Eggers to conquer, but it’s safe to say that, if The Northman is any indication, he’s unquestionably up for the task."
"Aug 24, 2022",positive," Twentieth-century softies like me may experience a film like Robert Eggers’ The Northman as a contemptuous but invigorating slap in the chops. Life was hard in AD 895, and every frame of the movie is there to show it, in all its magic-hour, snow-flecked beauty and all its torn-flesh, bloody-mud-puddle ugliness. Like Eggers’ two previous films — The Witch and The Lighthouse, both of which I adore — The Northman devotes itself to recreating a time long past, along with its moods, attitudes and details of day-to-day life. It would be easy indeed to parody The Northman, with all its shrieking madmen and howling to the black sky and chanting in the Old Languages. But Eggers offers up this material so earnestly, and with such carefully crafted art, that to lampoon it would feel callow and vile.  I’m about 75% on board with the film — it runs a bit long, and we start to feel it with about half an hour left to go — but I’m glad it was made, and I hope its poor showing at the box office won’t put Eggers in movie jail. This is the sort of expensive, excessive fantasia that sniffs around in deeper, darker nooks of cinema largely forgotten about and lifts the art form. The Northman is loud, with a brooding score and metal clashing against metal, but it has more in common with silent film than with anything else around. Based on the legend of Amleth (which in turn spawned Hamlet), it seems to want to take us back to the beginning of drama, or at least the birth of many tropes. It tells the most elemental of stories, the one about the son avenging his father, and grafts a lot of pagan strangeness and gore onto it.  Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is out to get his stinky uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who murdered Amleth’s father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), and married his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). For years, Amleth grunts and growls and readies himself for the moment when he realizes his oath: “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Amleth’s entire life becomes about that, after which, he guesses, he’ll just kill himself or something, because his life will no longer have purpose. Amleth does pursue a brief interest in the young sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who proposes another level of purpose to Amleth’s life. But mainly his fate seems to be mired in rage and pain and blood. It may take a little bit before a viewer recognizes that Amleth as presented here isn’t really the hero, just the protagonist.  The images appear to be charged by the post-human energies of spirits and fae. The shadows and scents of femininity seem to reduce these crude, brutal men to animals, and the women, dealing with this off-the-scale-toxic masculinity, are in danger of becoming inhuman wretches themselves. Queen Gudrún, for instance, certainly comes across as vindictive and cruel, but to what extent have the culture of 895 and its sickening rules (rape is no big deal, it’s part of every king’s victory lap) made her that way? There are other men, though, noncombatants, fools, he-witches, who have wiser heads — until they lose them to someone with a hotter head, plus a sword. The Northman seems simple, or simplistic, until we start turning it around and peering at it.   The sensibilities we see in the movie are very remote from ours. We could almost be watching aliens. Sometimes the film has a harshly musical Icelandic vibe; Eggers recruits the Icelandic poet Sjón as his co-scripter here, and puts Björk in majestic electrocuted-penguin garb as a character called the Seeress. As I said, the narrative begins to drag a little, but the compositions and the colors of night and the cast’s dedication to exploring long-gone behaviors — all of this is first-rate. The Northman might be my least favorite Eggers project, but that means nothing — oh, it’s only a B+, or maybe even an A-. Eggers goes big here, and uses paints he hasn’t used before. His three films feel alike, in that they could all unfold in the same uncanny, demon-haunted universe at different times, but they’re also very distinct accomplishments. Eggers is still a major reason to stay interested in whatever movies are becoming."
"Aug 8, 2022",positive," I’d love to have been a fly on the wall for the pitch. “Um, it’s an adaptation of a 12th-century Norse folk tale about a prince avenging the death of his father — you know, Shakespeare, well this one inspired Hamlet. It’s going to be really violent and much of it will be subtitled in Norse. But the farting and burping scene with Ethan Hawke is really going to work — trust me, Ethan’s put in a lot of work. Oh and we got Björk for the witch.”"

As Nicole Kidman says in her AMC cinemas ad the kids are loving to parody on TikTok, somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this. For Old Nic, here playing Queen Gudrun, that place is ancient Iceland and the heartbreak is the impending death of her husband King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke). He has returned from a pillaging trip with a brutal stomach wound and the desire to pass the royal mantle to their son Amleth (played as a young man by Oscar Novak).  Amleth escapes to the sea, chanting to himself as he rows to safety the mantra, ""I will revenge you father, I will save you mother, I will kill you Fjolnir."" Years later, Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgard) has joined the berserkers, a Viking killing machine, biding his time to one day enact his planned revenge. Branding himself as a slave, he stows away on a slave trader vessel destined for the village uncle Fjolnir now lords over and is befriended by feisty sorceress slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy).  There's an element of supernatural horror to the film, which is something Eggers did so well in his debut film The Witch that introduced Anya Taylor-Joy to the world. "
"Jul 26, 2022",positive," Hey, so you might have noticed my reviews haven’t been as frequent this year. Well, due to both professional and personal reasons, I’ve not been able to give the site as much attention as I would like. Your girl has got a lot of plates spinning right now, and as much as I love doing it, Alternative Lens isn’t as important as my ultimate career aspirations or my mental health. However, that didn’t mean I stopped seeing as many movies. In fact, I’ve seen so many more so far this year than I had by this time in 2021. So as a result, my bi-annual attempt to catch up on everything I didn’t have time to do a full review of, or didn’t have much of a take to warrant doing one, or just saw way too late, is now MUCH larger than it’d usually be. But if you REALLY need to know my thoughts on a movie as soon as I’ve seen it, give me a follow on Letterboxd here: https://letterboxd.com/AltFilmLens/. I’ll often do my quick thoughts on movies straight after I’ve seen them, including first watches of older films or revisiting movies I’ve seen before. So if you’ve been missing me on here and looking for more AltLens content, head on over to Letterboxd. It’s where all the cool kids are these days. (Disclaimer: I only saw this movie because I had time to kill and was able to see it for free. I would never have bothered otherwise, ‘cos I ain’t giving any of my money to Mumsnet Anita Bryant.) Most films end up being overhyped and can’t help but be disappointing once you finally see them. This is one of those rare exceptions. Everything Everywhere All at Once takes advantage of every aspect of the cinematic form to tell a story you couldn’t do justice in any other medium. It’s up there with Mad Max: Fury Road, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Matrix, in that it’s a movie that fully embraces the spectacle and artistry of cinema whilst never forgetting about what really matters: story, character, and theme. Michelle Yeoh has never been better. Stephaine Hsu is a revelation. Ke Huy Quan: truly a star reborn! I hope this is just the start of a renaissance for him. And who could ever say a bad thing about James Hong or Jamie Lee Curtis? But the real stars here are the Daniels. The screenplay and direction are just pure perfection. Yes, one could nitpick about certain logic gaps, but if you’re focusing that much on those insignificant details, then you’re watching movies wrong. The way they’ve balanced all the genre elements and absurdist comedy whilst also tackling some pretty dark and serious subject matter is the stuff of legends; the kind of excellence that will be studied and gushed over by film academics for decades to come. If there’s a better movie than this in 2022, then 2022 will have been a bloody landmark year for cinema. 10/10! “There are honestly worse movies this year, but on a moral level I’d rather you watch them than this, because at least there you don’t have to give a portion of your purchase to Prosecco Orson Scott Card.” No, if you read my review in full, you’d see I had plenty of criticism of the film itself; mainly the sloppy writing and lack of whimsy. I would have given the same score regardless of any personal feelings about the screenwriter and her opinions. It’s just an added reminder to readers about the commerce behind art which, whether you ignore it or not, exists and has an impact on the success of a piece. Also, this is my website. There’s no code of conduct stopping me from expressing my personal opinions. If I were writing this for another site, I would probably hold back those thoughts, but here I don’t have to. You don’t have to like my opinion, but not you or anyone else gets to police what I say. I thought folk like you were all about “freeze peach” and all that?"
"Jul 15, 2022",negative,It is disappointing that The Northman goes past what would have been a truly radical ending and extends itself for a zany climax that qualifies as Valhalla porn.

The Northman, a medieval nordic epic written and directed by Robert Eggers, begins with a familiar setup: a young prince loses his family and kingdom in an act of fraternal betrayal. King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) is assassinated by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), while his young son Amleth watches; the young prince also sees Fjölnir kidnap his mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), as part of a bloody coup to seize Aurvandil’s title and land. 




Barely avoiding capture, Amleth escapes and rows away, repeating a vow to avenge his father, kill his uncle, and rescue his mother—an overture to the story of a hero. (The film is based on a Scandinavian legend, recorded in the 13th century, that may have inspired Hamlet.)
We next see Amleth (played as an adult by Alexander Skarsgård) years later, now a formidable warrior applying his martial prowess to raiding Slavic villages. His revenge oath has been indefinitely deferred in favor of pillaging with a band of shamanic berserkers; he isn’t yet aware of Fjölnir’s movements, that his uncle has lost his land and fled to Iceland. Only after the urging of a mystical figure played by the musician Björk does Amleth resume his quest. He disguises himself as a slave bound for Fjölnir’s settlement; once he arrives, he plans a series of escalating attacks with the help of another captive, a Slavic sorceress named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). The campaign eventually destroys the remnant’s of Fjölnir’s kingdom, and Amleth faces his rival in a final duel at the top of a volcano.
Although The Northman represents Eggers’s most ambitious project yet, both in its narrative scope and budget, he is known for choosing stories like this—spooky historical dramas that can skew melodramatic—and managing to avoid sentimentality and shtick through obsessive, anthropological detail. In his previous films (The Witch, a horror film set on the edges of a 17th-century New England Puritan settlement, and The Lighthouse, a darkly funny 19th-century drama that follows two bickering lighthouse keepers in their descent into madness), Eggers has a knack for collecting period-specific ephemera—phrases from accounts of demonic possession, antique camera lenses, a museum-replica pagan rattle, and hand-stitched costumes—to make a coherent facsimile of a world. When the method works, tenets that might seem prosaic to modern viewers become vivid and urgent, located within a faithful reproduction of the setting that produced them.
Although there are flashes of this sensibility throughout The Northman, the film falls into an awkward middle ground between blockbuster epic and the cerebral historical dramas that preceded it, not quite filling either prompt. Moments of revelatory strangeness come inconsistently, and they feel disjointed from a plot that’s too unwieldy for verisimilitude alone to carry. The sequences that lack a sense of context to animate them can feel rote or even silly—a scene in which Amleth duels a ghost skeleton for a magic sword, for example; a couple of instances of animal-based deus ex machina; or the abrupt end of Olga and Amleth’s romantic relationship, soundtracked with a swell of music that make its pathos feel forced. Still, beyond the less convincing scenes, there are glimpses of a more interesting story that reflects Eggers’s broader interest in outcasts, grievance, and the futility of honoring one’s fate.

The AfD’s Secret Plan to Deport Millions From Germany

The AfD’s Secret Plan to Deport Millions From Germany



Linda Mannheim 






The parts of The Northman that take place in Iceland are set during a period early in the country’s colonization, about 16 years before the establishment of its parliament in 930 ad. The choice was intentional: The Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, who cowrote the script with Eggers, told The New Yorker that he “realized that we could slip in a family there, that settled early and then just disappeared from the face of the earth.” In his other films, Eggers has chosen settings on the fringes of a more formal society, which is effective for horror because it makes the consequences of interpersonal friction more dire. To see the danger of these places feels like a forgotten instinct: These small and isolated communities have no guarantee of survival, making their members both acutely dependent on and vulnerable to one another.
When we first see Fjölnir’s settlement, a cluster of buildings in a wide green valley in the shadow of a volcano, it feels precarious, barely rooted in the earth even before the machinations of a vengeful prince work to dismantle it. It’s the kind of place that, in Sjón’s words, looks like it could “just [disappear] from the face of the earth.” Sod-roofed structures covered in fresh grass appear halfway to being swallowed by the ground. With vast stretches of uninhabited wilderness as their alternative, a human village, even one as violent and miserable as Fjölnir’s, binds its inhabitants to it: “Even if you did escape this farm, you’d only be carrion for the blue fox and selkies,” another captive tells Amleth.

In Iceland, for Amleth, two tenets meant to ensure the preservation of social order soon come into conflict: the taboo on murder and the duty to enact vengeance on murderers, especially those who kill kings, whose position of invulnerability is necessary for the strength of the state. This paradox—whether to carry out a string of killings to symbolically buttress the sanctity of life—is at the center of many tragedies, including Hamlet. In The Northman, Amleth doesn’t dwell much on these social and moral intricacies: At one point he kills an opponent during a sports match by headbutting him to death. Yet he decides that he can’t take his final revenge on Fjölnir until the terms of the prophecy made by the seer in the Slavic village are met. “It was foretold that I would slay my father’s killer in a burning lake,” Amleth says. “Until that day comes, I will torment the man who made my life hell…. We thirst for vengeance, but we cannot escape our fate.” In the meantime, with Olga’s help, he executes a gruesome series of attacks on Fjölnir’s men, laden with religious symbolism, which the settlement’s priestess at first blames on a “distempered spirit.”
In this sense, The Northman resembles other recent films—The Green Knight, for example, based on the Arthurian chivalric romance, and Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman—that place preordained male violence in a nihilistic, almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic. These films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a person’s life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary, incidental, or vaguely foolish. Partway through Amleth’s campaign, his mother, Gudrún, confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited Fjölnir’s act of betrayal. Enraged, Amleth kills his uncle’s son, but he isn’t dissuaded from his goal. At the beginning of his final confrontation with Fjölnir, instead of rescuing Gudrún, Amleth murders her in a struggle.
In these films, the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time; their blood feuds, which give them purpose, contain no inherent depth, eloquence, or special insight. By the film’s conclusion, Amleth’s commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect, rolling forward on the strength of its own, preordained inertia. If in Hamlet a prince’s desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia, The Northman’s Amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien. This single-minded devotion to fate would benefit from Eggers’s anthropological insight; without it, we’re left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny, no matter how destructive, may offer transcendence in a grim, chaotic world. “Hate is all I have ever known,” Amleth tells Olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill Fjölnir. “But I wish I could be free of it.”
The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning. Enslaved laborers are killed at random; in the continuous shots of battle that Eggers favors, half a dozen discrete, horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds. During the raid on the Slavic village early in the film, Amleth rips out a man’s throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf. But the film suddenly cuts ahead, to just after the battle. Amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over, panting and bleeding from open cuts, their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain. A separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raid’s aftermath. In the longer view, Amleth’s group, dominant in battle, gains the connotation of hired muscle, useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards.
That moment has curious implications. It presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled, and casts Amleth’s quest in an almost entrepreneurial light. But those threads aren’t pursued. Soon after, Amleth hears about Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom and his departure to Iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe. “Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer,” the fighter says, laughing, as the cycle of fate starts over again.
 Barely avoiding capture, Amleth escapes and rows away, repeating a vow to avenge his father, kill his uncle, and rescue his mother—an overture to the story of a hero. (The film is based on a Scandinavian legend, recorded in the 13th century, that may have inspired Hamlet.)

It’s the kind of place that, in Sjón’s words, looks like it could “just [disappear] from the face of the earth.” Sod-roofed structures covered in fresh grass appear halfway to being swallowed by the ground. With vast stretches of uninhabited wilderness as their alternative, a human village, even one as violent and miserable as Fjölnir’s, binds its inhabitants to it: “Even if you did escape this farm, you’d only be carrion for the blue fox and selkies,” another captive tells Amleth.

In Iceland, for Amleth, two tenets meant to ensure the preservation of social order soon come into conflict: the taboo on murder and the duty to enact vengeance on murderers, especially those who kill kings, whose position of invulnerability is necessary for the strength of the state. This paradox—whether to carry out a string of killings to symbolically buttress the sanctity of life—is at the center of many tragedies, including Hamlet. In The Northman, Amleth doesn’t dwell much on these social and moral intricacies: At one point he kills an opponent during a sports match by headbutting him to death. Yet he decides that he can’t take his final revenge on Fjölnir until the terms of the prophecy made by the seer in the Slavic village are met. “It was foretold that I would slay my father’s killer in a burning lake,” Amleth says. “Until that day comes, I will torment the man who made my life hell…. We thirst for vengeance, but we cannot escape our fate.” In the meantime, with Olga’s help, he executes a gruesome series of attacks on Fjölnir’s men, laden with religious symbolism, which the settlement’s priestess at first blames on a “distempered spirit.”
In this sense, The Northman resembles other recent films—The Green Knight, for example, based on the Arthurian chivalric romance, and Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman—that place preordained male violence in a nihilistic, almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic. These films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a person’s life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary, incidental, or vaguely foolish. Partway through Amleth’s campaign, his mother, Gudrún, confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited Fjölnir’s act of betrayal. Enraged, Amleth kills his uncle’s son, but he isn’t dissuaded from his goal. At the beginning of his final confrontation with Fjölnir, instead of rescuing Gudrún, Amleth murders her in a struggle.
In these films, the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time; their blood feuds, which give them purpose, contain no inherent depth, eloquence, or special insight. By the film’s conclusion, Amleth’s commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect, rolling forward on the strength of its own, preordained inertia. If in Hamlet a prince’s desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia, The Northman’s Amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien. This single-minded devotion to fate would benefit from Eggers’s anthropological insight; without it, we’re left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny, no matter how destructive, may offer transcendence in a grim, chaotic world. “Hate is all I have ever known,” Amleth tells Olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill Fjölnir. “But I wish I could be free of it.”
The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning. Enslaved laborers are killed at random; in the continuous shots of battle that Eggers favors, half a dozen discrete, horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds. During the raid on the Slavic village early in the film, Amleth rips out a man’s throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf. But the film suddenly cuts ahead, to just after the battle. Amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over, panting and bleeding from open cuts, their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain. A separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raid’s aftermath. In the longer view, Amleth’s group, dominant in battle, gains the connotation of hired muscle, useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards.
That moment has curious implications. It presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled, and casts Amleth’s quest in an almost entrepreneurial light. But those threads aren’t pursued. Soon after, Amleth hears about Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom and his departure to Iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe. “Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer,” the fighter says, laughing, as the cycle of fate starts over again.
 Although The Northman represents Eggers’s most ambitious project yet, both in its narrative scope and budget, he is known for choosing stories like this—spooky historical dramas that can skew melodramatic—and managing to avoid sentimentality and shtick through obsessive, anthropological detail. In his previous films (The Witch, a horror film set on the edges of a 17th-century New England Puritan settlement, and The Lighthouse, a darkly funny 19th-century drama that follows two bickering lighthouse keepers in their descent into madness), Eggers has a knack for collecting period-specific ephemera—phrases from accounts of demonic possession, antique camera lenses, a museum-replica pagan rattle, and hand-stitched costumes—to make a coherent facsimile of a world. When the method works, tenets that might seem prosaic to modern viewers become vivid and urgent, located within a faithful reproduction of the setting that produced them.
Although there are flashes of this sensibility throughout The Northman, the film falls into an awkward middle ground between blockbuster epic and the cerebral historical dramas that preceded it, not quite filling either prompt. Moments of revelatory strangeness come inconsistently, and they feel disjointed from a plot that’s too unwieldy for verisimilitude alone to carry. The sequences that lack a sense of context to animate them can feel rote or even silly—a scene in which Amleth duels a ghost skeleton for a magic sword, for example; a couple of instances of animal-based deus ex machina; or the abrupt end of Olga and Amleth’s romantic relationship, soundtracked with a swell of music that make its pathos feel forced. Still, beyond the less convincing scenes, there are glimpses of a more interesting story that reflects Eggers’s broader interest in outcasts, grievance, and the futility of honoring one’s fate.

The AfD’s Secret Plan to Deport Millions From Germany

The AfD’s Secret Plan to Deport Millions From Germany



Linda Mannheim 






The parts of The Northman that take place in Iceland are set during a period early in the country’s colonization, about 16 years before the establishment of its parliament in 930 ad. The choice was intentional: The Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, who cowrote the script with Eggers, told The New Yorker that he “realized that we could slip in a family there, that settled early and then just disappeared from the face of the earth.” In his other films, Eggers has chosen settings on the fringes of a more formal society, which is effective for horror because it makes the consequences of interpersonal friction more dire. To see the danger of these places feels like a forgotten instinct: These small and isolated communities have no guarantee of survival, making their members both acutely dependent on and vulnerable to one another.
When we first see Fjölnir’s settlement, a cluster of buildings in a wide green valley in the shadow of a volcano, it feels precarious, barely rooted in the earth even before the machinations of a vengeful prince work to dismantle it. It’s the kind of place that, in Sjón’s words, looks like it could “just [disappear] from the face of the earth.” Sod-roofed structures covered in fresh grass appear halfway to being swallowed by the ground. With vast stretches of uninhabited wilderness as their alternative, a human village, even one as violent and miserable as Fjölnir’s, binds its inhabitants to it: “Even if you did escape this farm, you’d only be carrion for the blue fox and selkies,” another captive tells Amleth.

We thirst for vengeance, but we cannot escape our fate.” In the meantime, with Olga’s help, he executes a gruesome series of attacks on Fjölnir’s men, laden with religious symbolism, which the settlement’s priestess at first blames on a “distempered spirit.”
In this sense, The Northman resembles other recent films—The Green Knight, for example, based on the Arthurian chivalric romance, and Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman—that place preordained male violence in a nihilistic, almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic. These films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a person’s life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary, incidental, or vaguely foolish. Partway through Amleth’s campaign, his mother, Gudrún, confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited Fjölnir’s act of betrayal. Enraged, Amleth kills his uncle’s son, but he isn’t dissuaded from his goal. At the beginning of his final confrontation with Fjölnir, instead of rescuing Gudrún, Amleth murders her in a struggle.
In these films, the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time; their blood feuds, which give them purpose, contain no inherent depth, eloquence, or special insight. By the film’s conclusion, Amleth’s commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect, rolling forward on the strength of its own, preordained inertia. If in Hamlet a prince’s desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia, The Northman’s Amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien. This single-minded devotion to fate would benefit from Eggers’s anthropological insight; without it, we’re left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny, no matter how destructive, may offer transcendence in a grim, chaotic world. “Hate is all I have ever known,” Amleth tells Olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill Fjölnir. “But I wish I could be free of it.”
The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning. Enslaved laborers are killed at random; in the continuous shots of battle that Eggers favors, half a dozen discrete, horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds. During the raid on the Slavic village early in the film, Amleth rips out a man’s throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf. But the film suddenly cuts ahead, to just after the battle. Amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over, panting and bleeding from open cuts, their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain. A separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raid’s aftermath. In the longer view, Amleth’s group, dominant in battle, gains the connotation of hired muscle, useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards.
That moment has curious implications. It presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled, and casts Amleth’s quest in an almost entrepreneurial light. But those threads aren’t pursued. Soon after, Amleth hears about Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom and his departure to Iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe. “Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer,” the fighter says, laughing, as the cycle of fate starts over again.

"Jun 29, 2022",positive,"The Northman isn’t exactly a triumph, but with its many knockout moments, it represents a big step forward for the youngish director Robert Eggers, who for the first time has a big budget ($90 million) to work with. "
"Jun 28, 2022",positive," [CAUTION: There are some very general, spoiler-ish observations in this review that concern its closing scenes and the relationship between those scenes and the endings of Robert Eggers’ previous films The Witch and The Lighthouse.] It’s kind of amazing how many films I’ve seen built upon the Inigo Montoya mantra. (Let’s say it together: “You killed my father. Prepare to die.“) It’s even more amazing how fundamental that storyline is, considering the fact that I have never met a single human being whose father has been murdered by a traitorous acquaintance. Nor have I ever met anyone who had an opportunity to go on a revenge quest. And yet, just this morning, in conversation with a wise counselor, what was I wrestling with? I was tending to some wounds that I suffered as a young boy during a season of my father’s unemployment. At the time, I believed — passionately — that teachers and school administrators had wickedly conspired against him top end his job as a teacher. I remember feelings of rage, helplessness, and humiliation over the idea that anyone could take power away from my parents in ways that would make them suffer hardship. That was only the beginning. There was a lot that I know now that I did not understand then. I had a lot of growing up to do. Thus, even though I am weary of revenge narratives, I feel some measure of understanding and sympathy for the deeply wounded young hero of Robert Eggers’s new film The Northman. He too, as a young boy, witnesses his father “removal” from a place of power and influence. He too suffers emotional trauma and lets his fury harden into resentment that becomes a controlling factor in his life. Revenge is foolishness. But that doesn’t mean that stories about it are worthless. Sure, there is an epidemic in American entertainment of stories that glorify revenge — and that’s a toxic trend. But tales of vengeance can follow a righteously angry hero to so many possible conclusions: not only a violent reckoning or ruin, but also grace, forgiveness, reconciliation. I love Lee Isaac Chung’s film Munyurangabo, which I saw a whole decade before he made the Oscar-winning Minari. It’s a powerful story of a revenge quest that leads its angry and heartbroken antihero to a surprising turn. It’s a surprising story that finds hope at the end of a journey that began in trauma and wrath. Such stories are very rare throughout human history. But even if revenge tales end in the achievement of violence, they can become meaningful tragedies. In choosing violence over long-suffering and love, an antihero can illustrate the wages of sin and provide us with a cautionary tale. Consider Hamlet: the choice to answer killing with killing leads to greater consequences for everyone. I’ve always found the prevalence of such violence in mythology interesting — Celtic tales, Greek myths, whatever the origin — for how it illustrates the values and beliefs of particular peoples, places, and times. I first learned about the Norse god Vidar, also known as “The Silent God” and “the God of Revenge,” while paying very little attention during a boring college class on mythology. You want Vidar on your side if you’re on a revenge quest. After all, according to his origin story, Vidar knows the territory: Wreaking vengeance, he tore apart Fenrir, the wolf who had killed his own literal god-father: Odin. But why is Vidar described as a god of silence and revenge? The combination struck me as curious. Was Vidar silent because silence is an essential talent for someone who is determined to sneak up on a dangerous tyrant and kill him? That makes sense — especially if the villain might be anticipating such retaliation. Could it also be that a god of revenge is violent precisely because he is silent about his anger? Bottle up hard feelings and you’ll end up with a volcanic eruption. That’s some heavy wisdom — I’ve learned it from watching others in my family and community. I’ve learned it in my own experience. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that contemporary revenge narratives influence a culture that has such a huge appetite for them. The increasing violence in American culture wars seems to me to be influenced by these stories. Make an audience angry enough, and they will cheer for all manner of violence. And that includes Christian audiences, as evidenced by the popularity of Braveheart among evangelical Christians, and their increasing support for violent uprisings against their culture-war enemies (even though such uprisings are obviously contrary to Jesus’s own teachings). So, I had good reason to approach Eggers’s new movie with skepticism. Reading about the basic narrative arc of The Northman, I became nervous that this might become just a fancier, more enthralling version of the kind of narrative that Quentin Tarantino consistently serves up: a lurid feast appealing to an audience’s bloodlust. And, even more worrying than that — a Nordic revenge story? Right now? A story about clans of white people warring like animals in an endless cycle of violence and retaliation… making speeches about defending their bloodlines? Doesn’t that sound like the glorification of what’s going on all around us in the world right now and threatening not only our hopes for peace and justice but even our hopes of an inhabitable planet for future generations? I admire his two previous films The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2020). Both tell stories of characters who remove themselves from the “trouble” of society (as if that will help). The efforts of those characters fail — as they distance themselves from some sources of trouble, they learn the hard way that they have brought plenty of trouble with them into their isolation. Now, suffering in remote places, they have no community to rely on for help. Even more troubling, both films depict their doomed protagonists devolving into a kind of ecstatic madness, a victory that I don’t believe audiences are meant to believe in or celebrate. I think we’re supposed to recoil at their choices and at the frightful consequences. I interpret both as cautionary tales — or, better, cautionary nightmares — about how our impulses can lead us straight to hell. And I think we are shown that, just the Satan of Milton’s Paradise Lost determines to “make a heaven of hell,” so these characters fail to discern the gravity of their error, thinking they have somehow triumphed. What’s more, I think Eggers’s filmmaking powers are formidable. While both stories strike me as meaningful and worth studying, The Witch and The Lighthouse also look and sound extraordinary, their exquisite aesthetics conjuring a powerful sense of spiritual darkness, their scripts composed with a richly literary complexity, the lines delivered by actors who have mastered difficult dialects. Or is it just another Braveheart, justifying vengeful violence in the name of some kind of god, throwing fuel on the fire of the violent fantasies of the “culture warriors” who threaten democracy? For many moviegoers — perhaps most — The Northman will play like a darker, bloodier version of Gladiator, in which the audience roots for a suffering hero. He never quite says it, but the mantra is there all the same. He might have said “My name is Prince Amleth. You, Fjölnir The Brotherless, killed my father, King Aruvandil War-Raven. Prepare to die.” Instead, he says, “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” We watch Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) gird up his loins and sharpen his lances to carry out violent vengeance against a tyrant (Claes Bang) who took the throne of his father (Ethan Hawke) by treachery, and also made the queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) his own by force. The Northman is basically the ur-Hamlet, a version of classic story that pre-dates any of Shakespeare’s concerns about Ophelia or the role of the Players in “catching the conscience of the king.” This is the most fundamental of revenge quests. This Amleth doesn’t care about wordplay. He devotes his life to the long game of stealth and vengeance, his intent easy readable in the creases of his forehead and the scowl of his posture. Amleth gets a decade-long training in Viking masculinity, complete with  fireside dances and chants, hand-to-hand combat, costumes of animal skins, communion with wolves and with witchcraft (including a Seeress played by none other than the great sorceress of pop music: Bjork!), and with a sort of Crossfit program that involves a lot of rowing. It’s easy to root for him… at first. But there is a strange contradiction at the movie’s heart — manifested in the character of Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). Amleth and Olga form a tenuous bond of mutual support as they earn their way up the chain of slavery to Fjölnir The Brotherless, until they find themselves in  Iceland — Fjölnir has been driven out of his own kingdom and forced to settle elsewhere — at the edge of Fjölnir’s inner circle and family. When they get there, Amleth is troubled to discover that the story he has told himself throughout his life has been a false narrative. Fake News. Those events that traumatized him in childhood, they weren’t as simple as he’d imagined. It wasn’t just a case of the Evil World committing sins against a Saint. Olga, the tender and beautiful slave who sees Amleth’s hardship so clearly, becomes a beacon of wisdom and hope in his life. It’s seems only right that she’s played by Anya Taylor-Joy, the actress who has, in my opinion, eyes that seem to have been custom made for the camera’s attention (yea, more than the eyes of any actor living or dead). Her tremendous, shining eyes give Olga a sense of seeing so much more than Amleth’s narrow and bloodshot eyes ever could. She eventually comes to see a hope for the two of them to break away from the path of violence and find a more meaningful and rewarding life somewhere else. She wants to set Amleth free from the dangers of clinging to the source of his wrath, that false narrative he has believed, that false narrative that he might now see clearly and overcome. Here is an opportunity to show audiences something so much more than — so much better than — the bloody revenge for which so many of them seem to have an insatiable appetite. If I can trust my first experience with the film, I think Olga becomes the movie’s conscience. We embrace Amleth’s doubts, his momentary fear that he might not have any moral high ground to stand on here, as he waves his sword around and challenges his foe. Will Amleth choose to reject the wiser, more complicated understanding of what was really happening in his youth? Will he hold to his original emotional response, as reasonable as it might have been once upon a time, even though he now has a chance to see that it was childish, and that it will only lead to more bloodshed and folly? I think we are supposed to side with Olga in her appeal to dissuade Amleth from his quest. I have a hard time believing that Eggers us to side with Amleth in abandoning a future with his family in favor of the glory of a battle to the death. I think Eggers wants us to see that this is an old, old story, and that today we can be enlightened enough to glimpse a brighter path. So much depends upon how we interpret the film’s closing moments — which I won’t spoil here. They complicate matters significantly, and give those who disagree with me their best evidence.Several of the critics I trust the most are upset about this movie, making strong arguments that it is not only disappointing but dangerous. I completely respect these arguments. So, rather than claim I have “the right reading” of this film, I’m inclined to borrow an expression from Winston Churchill (who was speaking about Russia, not Hamlet, when he said them): Eggers’ film is “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” It’s going to get people talking. But at this point, I do have a different interpretation of the film — particularly because I can’t stop thinking about Eggers’s two previous films. Both The Witch and The Lighthouse give us central characters who “turn to the Dark Side,” so to speak. In their minds and by their chosen values, they triumph — sure. But they do so at the cost of their own souls. At the cost of their souls. I am inclined to argue — only every so slightly, and I’m wide open to being persuaded otherwise — that The Northman is right in step with those films. I believe that Amleth is a tragic figure, one who is deluded into thinking he has triumphed, but from whom we must keep a skeptical distance, refusing to celebrate him as triumphant, horrified by what has become of him and what will probably likely become of his family. His self-affirming vision at the end is not unlike the ecstatic ascension of the young woman possessed at the conclusion of The Witch. In the film’s fiery volcano finale, I couldn’t help but hear the distant echo of Young Obi-Wan’s cry: “You were the chosen one!” Yeah, Amleth might’ve been, if he’d listened. The most heroic figure I know had a singular response to unfathomable evil, and in his response I find hope for an ultimate deliverance. After all, once you have started down the Dark Path, if you don’t seize upon the moments of grace that are offered you, well… as the little green guru says, “forever will it dominate your destiny.” I prefer the Shakespeare version of this story, for the record. It gives us a clearer vision of wisdom and folly. And its truth can set us free.  But I think Eggers’ version will stick with me. Amleth’s dawning realizations about all that he misunderstood in childhood — these resonate with me. Some of the work I am doing now is learning to accept revelations about my childhood that were a long time coming. In a sense, it’s yet another injury, another realization of betrayal. It wasn’t a case of my family being “the Good Guys” and the world around us being “The Bad Guys.” The impulse to draw lines in such a binary fashion is understandable when someone is hurt, but it’s also childish, and it can cause us to take a bad situation and make it far, far worse. I look back at many years of speaking with contempt for those who I believed to be antagonistic toward my family. I look back at the stories I believed, the stories I told myself, and how they hardened into fury and resentment that have probably burned years away from the potential span of my life. The truth is setting me free — but not before the lies (some of which have been self-inflicted) have done a world of damage. I’m grateful for storytellers who have helped me see the cost of vengeful impulses. I’m grateful for the Gospel’s vision of a braver response that can lead to help and healing. Thus, I’ve broken away from the masses that cheer for the fulfillment of revenge quests. Stories of violent heroism always seem like tragedies to me. Violence is cyclical, after all: If you respond to violence with violence, all you’re doing is perpetuating violence in a way that all but guarantees it will continue. Instead of going all Braveheart and raising a weapon in a roaring challenge, Christ receives his enemies’ violence with open arms, suffers it, and refuses to let it remain in the world. In canceling violence, he saves us  from sins. That is the kind of courage and character I find worth celebrating. Amleth is too blinded by rage, and by a perverse cultural milieu of what we now call “toxic masculinity,” to see the better path. And that is why his story is such a tragedy. Hopefully it will be received by audiences for what I believe it is: a memorable, harrowing, cautionary nightmare."
"Jun 26, 2022",positive," There’s a recurring wave of unease that subsumes much of Robert Eggers’ “The North-man”. Every moment seems to exist on the verge of disruption, as if ephemerality is baked into the structure. And so, we gain excitement from watching chaos manifested. Ruptures and disruption are critical to what is at work here, so much so that the first image of the film is a volcanic eruption that envelopes the screen. Danger is imminent. And of course, it is. This is a miserable and punishing world. How wonderful, then, that for all the cruel misery at work “The Northman” feels propulsive and exciting even as we work our way, methodically, to inevitable areas of tragedy and despair. This world might be miserable, but the filmmaking on display is energising and exciting. Eggers’ film, co-written with Icelandic poet Sjón, is based on the legend of Amleth (our hero) by Saxo Gramma-ticus, a tale of Norse mythology that is more readily remembered as the source for Shake-speare’s “Hamlet”. Although, thinking of “The Northman” as a Viking version of Hamlet misses out some of the specific weirdness that feels endemic to Eggers’ work as a filmmaker over his three-film oeuvre. Whether implicit, or explicit, Shakespeare remains an influential figure in film over the last two centuries and Eggers variation on the very familiar tale of the embittered son avenging the name of his dead father is one that feels innately familiar. But nothing in Eggers’ approach to this story feels familiar or banal. I spent a lot of “The Northman” remembering how dull I found so much of the approach to the narrative in Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth” earlier this year. Of course, Coen was working with a more straightforward adaptation of that particular play but the most telling attitude of Eggers’ take on the angry vengeance at the root of his film (a similar emotion that is essential for “Macbeth”) feels tactile and visceral in a way that resists any notions of austerity, remoteness or reticence. Eggers’ approach is confrontational. He demands our attention and then plays with our senses, bringing “The Northman” to climax after climax that challenges our perception of this world. A brief prelude, where we meet the young Amleth and learn about the dynamics of this world, effectively establishes this this tactility. Jarin Blaschke’s camera moves through the shadowy castle in a way that makes even the most regal parts of this world look grimy and uncomfortable. So, we meet Nicole Kidman’s Queen Gudrún, who is imposing and fearsome as much as she is beautiful and beguiling. Her energy provides an intriguing dynamic with Ethan Hawke’s weary King Aurvandill, who offers a paternalistic countenance that feels warm but ambiguous enough for Amleth to spend the rest of the film wishing to avenge him. King Aurvandill’s murder is an early highpoint that confirms Eggers willingness to confront the magnetic violence at the heart of this world. The camera does not avert its gaze, but confronts us with unbridled brutality. Young Amleth’s flight from the scene is a wonderful sequence as the film moves from the past into the present in a mesmerising bit of camerawork. “The Northman” is winningly engaging at every turn, and is best when it becomes an unabashed technical marvel. It’s definitely Eggers’ least actor-focused script, so within that it’s no surprise that the most effective turns are by actors from who we know have always been able to do the most with the least. Hawke’s paternal gaiety commands the first sections, Willem Dafoe’s manic energy lingers long after we see him last and – of course – Kidman .in a film overwhelmed by competing versions of masculinity, offers a sly and confident performance that’s punctuated by her eyes darting in the background in every scene – contemplating, if not always commenting on, the action around her. Each performer feels more interesting when opposite her. It is a role that in truth feels too brief but effectively teases the promise that is manifested in a late scene with Skarsgård that improbably ends up feeling like the highpoint of a film with so many eclectic fight-sequences. But, everyone is good, even if limited by the parameters of the film, which sees these characters less as individualised figures and more as part of a fabric of hate, vengeance and brutality that this Viking world is built on. In this way, it lacks the unpredictable looseness of “The Lighthouse” (Eggers’ best film) but offers a clarity of vision that retains the kind of technical specificity that is so key to his work so far. What I find most compelling about “The Northman” is the way it recognises the cruel brutality of this world and the angry malfeasance of humanity but still feels exciting and exhilarating and that, for me, is the most significant aspect. There is a consistent propulsive energy at work in “The Northman” that is its best asset. How strange that a film that is so full of the most miserable aspects of human nature feels so energetic. For all the death and blood and gore, “The Northman” offers the kind of visceral thrills that feel tapped into the full aesthetic parameters of what cinema can offer. It’s one of the highlights of 2022 thus far."
"Jun 24, 2022",positive," Satanic goats don't talk in The Northman. Heartthrobs don't masturbate while fondling mermaid figurines, either. Still, within ten minutes, pre-teen Viking prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, The Batman), his glory-seeking warrior father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke, Moon Knight) and jester-meets-shaman Heimir (Willem Dafoe, Nightmare Alley) descend into a fire-lit cave to take hallucinogens, growl, grunt, bark like wolves and fart like it's a god-given superpower. If viewers didn't know who's behind this bold, brutal, brilliant, and blood- and guts-strewn Scandinavian opus before then, there's no doubt from this trippy scene onwards: after The Witch and The Lighthouse, writer/director Robert Eggers' touch, approach and style have become that distinctive just three remarkable features into his helming career. As he first demonstrated with his potent pilgrim horror movie, then doubled down on with his mesmerising oceanside nightmare, Eggers crafts chaotic celluloid dreams about faith- and sanity-stretching dances with madness and mania. He makes features so striking that they're haunting, rippling with the devotedly realistic and the hypnotically occult in tandem. Eggers' work isn't merely meticulously tense and atmospheric; it proves blisteringly visceral to the point of feeling inescapably tangible. Indeed, his steadfast commitment to authenticity spirits the whole concept of immersive filmmaking high into movie Valhalla. See: the vivid period-appropriate detail in The Northman's Nordic villages, which'd only be more evocative if they'd time-travelled in from the ninth and tenth centuries. Sense: the entrancing swirl that springs from all of the above, complete with Eggers' unfailing idiosyncrasies. Experience: the sublime tussle with myth, fantasy and folklore that results, as it has in each of his features, to both plunge into and interrogate his history-set reveries. In this untamed and laid-bare portrait of the past, something is rotten in the state of Iceland — as it was in Denmark via William Shakespeare, and in the Pride Lands of Africa in both versions of The Lion King. Writing The Northman's screenplay with poet, novelist and Björk collaborator Sjón (Lamb), Eggers takes his cues not from Hamlet, however, but from the Old Norse legend of Amleth that inspired the iconic tragedy. The narrative still involves a son anointed to be the future king, a tragedy that shatters his regal family, and a dastardly uncle who gets murderous to seize the throne and his brother's wife, of course. And, it keeps following its protagonist as he wages a determined odyssey of feral revenge against the man who reshaped his fate so ruthlessly. ""I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir."" That's Amleth's vow as a boy on a north Atlantic island in 895 when he witnesses the latter's (Claes Bang, Locked Down) treachery. He flees after hearing his uncle bay for his head, too, and seeing him carry off Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, Being the Ricardos) as a spoil of his victory. Two decades later, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, Succession) is a hulking, wolfskin-clad Viking berserker, living life flinging whatever weaponry he can find while viciously pillaging through the lands of the Rus. But amid the bloodlust, gore and piling-up body count, the intense marauder is thrust back onto his vengeance-seeking path. A Slavic seeress (Björk, in her first film role since 2005) whispers stark truths about his current savagery and lapsed mission against Fjölnir, reigniting his yearning for that promised slaughter — and the single-minded behemoth learns that his uncle is now sheep-farming in Iceland, having lost the kingdom in another coup. A line from Hamlet comes to mind: ""now could I drink hot blood"". By the time Amleth brands himself to pass as a prisoner of war, slips onto a slave ship and ensures he's among the new captives at Fjölnir's ranch, he's already literally done just that. But his thirst for honouring his father, rescuing his mother and slaying his uncle remains unquenched, and he soon has help from and the heart of fellow servant Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, who scored her big break with The Witch alongside Eggers). How that quest eventuates won't surprise anyone familiar with the Bard, but The Northman still astonishes again and again. As only visionary filmmakers can, Eggers refuses to take any expected turn or make a single predictable move even while playing with a plot that's long spilled its thrills across popular culture, and while slashing into a genre — Viking epics — that's rarely far from screens. High among The Northman's joys and wonders, both large and small, sits its cast — with Skarsgård fulfilling a decade-plus journey from playing True Blood vampire Eric Northman to both starring in and producing this, which he's been trying to bring to fruition for just as long. His muscular power and presence as the epitome of rage and revenge is pulsating, not to mention physically commanding, and buying Amleth as the lacerating spirit of both a wolf and a bear is one of the easiest things about the film. His Big Little Lies co-star Kidman also turns in a ferocious performance, and the pair's evolution from that TV hit's husband-and-wife dynamic to this flick's unhinged mother-and-son duo drips with the requisite Oedipal creepiness. Elsewhere, Bang does brooding villainy like he's born to it, as he showed in Dracula; 22 years after playing Hamlet himself, Hawke delivers a 20-minute supporting-player masterclass; and the inimitable Taylor-Joy ensures that no one else could ever be pictured in her pivotal part. Plus, that Eggers finds small roles for The Witch's Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson doesn't go unnoticed. A ravaging rampage of a film — a movie beating with unshakeable fury, as metal a Viking saga that's ever likely to be made, and equally thunderous and off-kilter — Eggers' best feature yet wouldn't be what it is without its weight and spectacle, though. It's a picture of brusque poetry in its dialogue, its curt lines laden with importance but never trite (Amleth's stated juggling act to find ""kindness for my kin and hate for my enemies"" included). It's a work of elemental potency in its sweepingly shot imagery, with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (a veteran of all three of the director's films) painting with light, the stunning landscapes, and the wind, rain, snow, mud, fire and ash that lurks upon it. That's true in the head-splitting game of Knattleikr that makes just one primal centrepiece, the climactic naked volcano sword fight and the many supernatural-laced sights in-between. And, it all contributes to a breathtaking cinematic onslaught that savvily turns hellishness into movie heaven — all without shying away from the costs and sacrifices of Amleth's crusade; serving up a simplistic revenge fantasy; or excusing, glorifying or downplaying the relentless violence that informs every moment."
"Jun 19, 2022",positive," Cada vez somos más voces —incluida la mía— las que, puede que en una señal de senectud prematura, ponen el grito en el cielo mientras se llevan las manos a la cabeza frente a un presunto estado de la industria cinematográfica actual en el que la creatividad y el riesgo, o bien parecen haber muerto a favor de las franquicias y las fórmulas, o han quedado desterradas a las profundidades de los gigantescos y laberínticos catálogos de las plataformas de streaming. Pero, en medio de lo que parece ser un cambio radical en la tendencia de los hábitos de consumo, producción y distribución, aún quedan autores y compañías que continúan arriesgando y llevando a las salas de cine títulos que, en pleno 2022, casi podrían ser considerados como pequeños milagros. Sin ir más lejos, el estreno de 'X' de Ti West está a la vuelta de la esquina, pero la muestra más reciente de esta suerte de résistance fílmica es la descomunal épica vikinga 'El hombre del norte'.  Después de enamorar —más en el circuito de festivales que entre el público tradicional, todo sea dicho— con su excepcional debut 'La bruja' y esa pesadilla febril monócroma titulada 'El faro', Robert Eggers ha vuelto a la carga con una nueva rareza en la que terror, venganza y mitología nórdica se dan la mano en uno de los espectáculos más sugestivos y viscerales que hemos podido disfrutar en la gran pantalla durante los últimos años. Todo aquél que esté familiarizado con la obra previa de Eggers podrá intuir de buenas a primeras que 'El hombre del norte' no es, en absoluto, un filme convencional. Una vez más, el natural de New Hampshire ha vuelto a manifestar su enorme pasión por los grandes cineastas europeos al filtrar las bases narrativas y conceptuales de 'Conan el Bárbaro' a través del prisma de leyendas como Carl Theodor Dreyer, Werner Herzog —es complicado no pensar en su 'Aguirre'— o el Tarkovski de 'Andrei Rublev'. Aunque los avances publicados hasta la fecha puedan invitar a pensar en una orgía de violencia, espadazos y vendetta a la escandinava —elementos que están presentes, y en no pocas cantidades—, la cinta se revela mucho más interesada en representar a fuego lento el folclore de la zona mientras lo introduce bajo la piel del espectador abrazando códigos propios del horror y sin titubear al apostar por lo onírico; generando una atmósfera tan magnética como malsana y enrarecida. Si estas pretensiones resultan tan satisfactorias es, en buena parte, gracias a un tratamiento formal excepcional y, a su manera, hermoso, que podría invitar a pensar en una alternativa multimillonaria a la magnífica 'Valhalla Rising' de Nicholas Winding Refn. El mimo volcado en la planificación y la puesta en escena por parte de Eggers se combina una vez más con la dirección de fotografía de Jardin Blaschke —su DOP de cabecera—, que imprime sobre 35mm instantáneas inolvidables; incluyendo unos primeros planos arrebatadores rodados con lentes Petzval. Por desgracia, el talento desbordante que destila cada una de sus escenas, la visceralidad que envuelve su trama y el brillante modo en que se traslada a la pantalla no será fácil de digerir para todo el mundo, en parte, gracias a unos tráilers que ponen toda la carne en el asador obviando un tono y una cadencia que poco tienen en común con Schwarzenegger desmembrando enemigos en la mencioanda joya de John Milius. No obstante, quien se entregue sin prejuicios a los muchos placeres que ofrece 'El hombre del norte' descubrirá una de esas obras únicas y en peligro de extinción condenadas, injustamente, a pegarse un batacazo tremendo en taquilla."
"Jun 19, 2022",positive," THE CONTRACTOR (2022). A standard operating procedure is employed by The Contractor, a military-minded thriller with nary a novel idea in its stridently routine screenplay. Chris Pine headlines as James Harper, a Special Forces sergeant who’s involuntary discharged from the Army after the use of contraband drugs to treat his battle-earned injuries. Cruelly deprived of his pension, he’s encouraged by his best friend (Ben Foster) to take a high-paying job with an underground military outfit run by a no-nonsense veteran (Kiefer Sutherland). James is assigned to eliminate a scientist (Fares Fares) with ties to ISIS, only to learn that he’s been misled by the ostensible good guys who of course now want him terminated as well. Pine and Foster, who played brothers in 2016’s excellent Hell or High Water, now co-star as brothers-in-arms, but, like pretty much everything else in this drab undertaking, there’s nothing fresh or noteworthy about their characters or their performances. The only character of note is Virgil, the lonely caretaker of a remote safe house — Eddie Marsan makes us feel the weight of this man’s haunting memories and crushing isolation, and it’s a shame that the part is so small. Director Tarik Saleh effectively stages a couple of shootouts, but that’s not enough to save this otherwise inert actioner. THE GUILTY (1947) / HIGH TIDE (1947). As with Repeat Performance (reviewed last week), the Flicker Alley label has teamed with the Film Noir Foundation and the UCLA Film & Television Archive to revive and restore two more noirs from 1947 and lovingly bring them to Blu-ray and DVD. Whereas Repeat Performance was a standalone title, The Guilty and High Tide have been released in a double feature edition. Cornell Woolrich, the prolific mystery writer adored by both Hollywood and François Truffaut (adaptations include Rear Window, The Window, Phantom Lady, and The Bride Wore Black), found his short story “Two Men in a Furnished Room” transformed into the decent “B” flick The Guilty. Bonita Granville, a former child actress best known for starring as Nancy Drew in the late-‘30s film series, plays twin sisters — one good and one bad, of course — who become involved with testy roommates Mike (Don Castle) and Johnny (Wally Cassell). When one of the siblings is murdered and all evidence points to Johnny, Mike takes it upon himself to find the real killer. The ending is sure to catch many viewers by surprise. Even better is High Tide, which opens with a car crash that has pinned down both private eye Tim Slade (Castle) and newspaper editor Hugh Fresney (Lee Tracy). As the pair eye the rising waters that will eventually drown them, the movie enters flashback mode and shows how they got to this point. It’s a twisty tale that paints Fresney as a crusader unafraid of the mobsters who rule the city and Slade as the former reporter who’s roped into this mess by his ex-boss. There are two sets of potential love triangles with some Venn diagram overlapping, a shocking murder within the newspaper building, a role for character actor Regis Toomey, who played a detective in The Guilty and plays one here as well, and, as with The Guilty, a surprise villain. Tracy, often cast as newspapermen (as in the 1932 pre-Code chiller Doctor X), gives one of his best performances as the wily editor who never slows down. Extras consist of film historian audio commentary on both titles; introductions to both movies by film historian and noir expert Eddie Muller; featurettes on Jack Wrather and John Reinhardt, respectively the producer and director of both films; and separate pieces on Woolrich and Tracy. A booklet is also included. THE HORSE SOLDIERS (1959). It sounds like a piece of trivia that can’t possibly be correct: Over the course of his career, one largely defined by his Westerns, John Ford only directed one feature focusing on the Civil War. (He also tackled the War Between the States in 1963’s How the West Was Won, but that was just one segment in a multipart movie.) It’s a shame, then, that The Horse Soldiers doesn’t rank more highly in his oater oeuvre: It’s beautifully photographed (by William Clothier) and contains some rousing set-pieces, but it’s hindered by thinly drawn characters and a scarcely believable romance. Based on an actual incident, this stars John Wayne as Colonel Marlowe, a Union officer tasked with leading a raid deep into Confederate territory. Strictly militaristic in thought and deed, he butts heads with Major Kendall (William Holden), the outfit’s doctor and a man disgusted with every aspect of war. Marlowe and Kendall are painted in broad strokes — unusual for a John Ford production — and the story grows convoluted when the group is forced to take along a Southern belle (Constance Towers) who has overheard their plans. Naturally, she and Marlowe begin as enemies and end as sweethearts. The Horse Soldiers is the third Civil War flick to hit Blu-ray within the past 12 months, but it’s not as exciting as Major Dundee or as complex as Shenandoah. LAST PASSENGER (2013). Here’s a pleasant surprise, an under-the-radar thriller that’s been largely undiscovered for nearly a decade now. In the tradition of Steven Spielberg’s Duel, it features an unseen force of evil at the controls of a vehicular instrument of destruction — in this case, it’s a train rather than a truck. A late-night train leaving London is carrying only six passengers when it becomes obvious that something isn’t right: The ticket-taker is missing and scheduled stops are being bypassed. Lewis (Dougray Scott), a widowed doctor traveling with his young son (Joshua Kaynama), sets out to investigate, alternately helped and hindered by the other passengers: a lovely event coordinator (Kara Tointon), an impertinent businessman (David Schofield), a testy London Underground worker (Iddo Goldberg), and a kindly grandmother (Lindsay Duncan). Writer-director Omid Nooshin immediately primes himself for success by creating interesting and well-rounded characters who hold our attention even before the thriller aspect makes its first appearance. Scott, forever known as The Man Who Would Be Wolverine (he was cast in the X-Men role before delays tied to his Mission: Impossible 2 involvement forced him to drop out), and Tointon make an appealing couple, and Nooshin doesn’t skimp on putting his protagonists through some hair-raising situations. THE NORTHMAN (2022). Writer-director Robert Eggers, at the helm of his third motion picture following 2016’s The Witch and the 2019 10 Best entry The Lighthouse, takes on Hamlet before it was Hamlet. Working primarily from a legend largely brought to light by 12th-century Danish author Saxo Grammaticus — a medieval saga that directly inspired Shakespeare to pen his magnum opus — Eggers and co-scripter Sjón have created a ferocious revenge tale that’s heavy on the blood and sweat but light on the tears. It tells the story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, who also produced), an Icelandic warrior seeking vengeance against the uncle (Claes Bang) who murdered his father (a miscast Ethan Hawke) and took off with his mother (Nicole Kidman). To get close to his target, Amleth disguises himself as a slave, an action that puts him in the same company as a captured sorceress (Anya Taylor-Joy) who shares many of his goals. The Northman is a rousing Viking yarn where the supernatural easily commingles with reality, a world in which witches and seers carry as much weight as kings and queens. It’s an absolutely immersive experience, with Eggers and team offering an up-close-and-personal seat to a searing, soaring spectacle. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by Eggers; a making-of featurette; deleted and extended scenes; and a look at Knattleikr, the violent game prominently featured in one exciting sequence. THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1998). There have been many screen versions of the Gaston Leroux novel (including the Universal classics with Lon Chaney and Claude Rains and the Hammer not-so-classic with Herbert Lom), as well as many take-offs and knock-offs (among them the imaginative Phantom of the Paradise and the idiotic Phantom of the Mall: Eric’s Revenge). I daresay Dario Argento’s interpretation might be the worst of them all, and, yes, I’ve seen the version starring Freddy Krueger as the Phantom. Co-written by Argento and frequent Roman Polanski collaborator Gérard Brach (Tess, The Fearless Vampire Killers), this gonzo picture takes plenty of bold chances, but when not a single one works, what’s the point? Here, the opera-house dweller isn’t a physical grotesquerie but a handsome man (Julian Sands, boring beyond belief) who, not unlike the abandoned baby raised by penguins in Batman Returns, was an abandoned baby lovingly raised by rats. Possessing telepathic(!) abilities, he develops a rapport with opera singer Christine Daaé (Asia Argento, awful beyond compare), who falls in love with both the Phantom and with suitor Raoul (Andrea Di Stefano, stiff beyond imagining). The bloodletting should please the gore-galore crowd; others will want to steer clear of the wreckage. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981). This dream project between Steven Spielberg and George Lucas is one of the all-time greats, a delightful thrill-a-minute flick in the grand swashbuckling and movie serial traditions. Harrison Ford is perfection-plus as Indiana Jones, so iconic a character that the AFI cited him as the second greatest movie hero of all time (just under Atticus Finch and just above James Bond) in its 2003 “100 Heroes & Villains” list. Every character is richly brought to life, particularly Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood, Paul Freeman’s Belloq (a frequently underrated villain), and, oh, yeah, that treacherous capuchin monkey. Nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director for Spielberg), it nabbed four statues for its film editing, visual effects, sets, and sound, as well as a Special Achievement Award for sound effects editing. Raiders of the Lost Ark made its 4K debut last summer as part of the Indiana Jones 4-Movie Collection. It’s now being offered as a standalone 4K feature in a new Steelbook edition that includes no extras but does contain a digital code and a mini-poster. The three sequels will likewise be released individually, with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arriving July 12, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade out August 16, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull due September 20. THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). While films about labor disputes between unions and management sound about as exciting as HOA board meetings, the truth is that there have been some solid dramas to emerge from this subgenre. Joining the likes of Martin Ritt’s Norma Rae and John Sayles’ Matewan is this all-but-forgotten film that was shot on location in New Hampshire. When the benevolent owner (Donald McKee) of a plastics company dies in an airplane crash, his widow (silent-cinema star Dorothy Gish in one of her few talkies) takes over and immediately promotes the likable Brad Adams (Lloyd Bridges) to supervisor, figuring he can serve as an effective bridge between the company, the union, and the factory workers positioned between the pair. But when Brad realizes that the only way to save the company from going under is to lay off half the employees, he quickly becomes persona non grata with his co-workers. With the writing credited to six individuals (including the gent who receives the unusual billing of “an original story suggested and developed from the research of”), this turns out to be a thoughtful picture with no easy answers (at least until the happy ending), and the supporting cast includes up-and-comers Ernest Borgnine, Murray Hamilton, Anne Francis, and Carleton Carpenter (who passed away this past January at the age of 95)."
"Jun 9, 2022",positive," A legitimate roller coaster ride, a love letter to watching a movie through the slots in your fingers because the frenzy at times can be just too much to bear (in the best way possible). Only a delightful sicko like Bay could direct something like this; that ambulance surgery scene is seared into my brain. COVID Rear Window. Steven Soderbergh is one of the most talented director from his generation if only because he can quite literally direct anything, any genre, at any time. The protest/van scene and the “Sabotage” sequence made me yell aloud in excitement. One of the best movies of the year; watching this and The Northman back-to-back was a hell of a way to spend a Monday. Well, this is much better than The Crimes of Grindelwald, one of the worst studio blockbusters I’ve seen in the last 10 years, and when it actually focuses on the beasts, it’s a fun time. Jude Law was an excellent Dumbledore pick, and he understands the assignment. Dan Fogler is always a hoot in these movies and really seems invested in the character, and Mads Mikkelsen is just such an improvement over [REDACTED]. The problem is that even the good stuff here feels wholly unnecessary. The first film in the series did a good enough job of actually living up to its promise, but trying to shoehorn the Dumbledore/Grindelwald saga in this series just was the wrong decision. That needed its own movie without trying to tie itself down. I quite enjoyed this for what it was, but I’m just unsure we really need another one of these movies. I’d be much more obliged to watch it after this one as opposed to that awful second film. It just all feels like content over cinema; something recognizable, something occasionally fun and compelling, just never … needed. Where the hell was all the love for this when it came out? Just a sleek, purposefully messy chamber piece heightened by Rylance chewing every bit of scenery and a really tight, purposeful script. The type of movie that would’ve done better in 2005, methinks. It helps that Dylan O’Brien, Zoey Deutch and Johnny Flynn are among the best in their young class of underappreciated actors. Graham Moore is a guy I’ve got high hopes for. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a nice little mob drama like this. Tom Cruise is the greatest movie star of all time. I think this settles the debate. He’s a weird cat, but the man understands the theatrical experience probably better than any actor to ever live. He’s created some of the most thrilling works ever, and pushes the limits every time into what he can do. There have been some greats, but Cruise is the king. He’s the best that ever was or will be. This is stellar. Top Gun: Maverick feels like The Irishman for blockbusters, with the criticism going much more outward than inward. If you’d like to ask Tom Cruise about his opinion on the state of studio filmmaking, here’s your answer. …so I think I know what answer he gave Marvel? It’s right up there with Creed and Star Wars: The Force Awakens for bombastic legacyquels, but it feels much more like the former in pushing the craft forward and in the latter in just delivering everything you were hoping for. A perfect blend of both approaches. All-time movie theater experience; one of the great sequels, too. A modest, intriguing little crime drama that lets Jesse Plemons kind of take over for stretches and do his thing, which I always approve of. Not sure if it fully lands that ending, but I really enjoyed the ride. FWIW: Nicolas Cage didn’t have to make this for folks to celebrate his talent (blessedly, we did that last year with Pig, and in 2018 with Mandy). This, at least to me, would’ve worked better as a Funny or Die short, but Cage and Pedro Pascal as BFFs is fun enough to help cover up the uninteresting plot. This isn’t the shocking satirical introspection into a generational actor/enigma it kind of billed itself to be, more an SNL-style movie where a man plays a meme. Cage is always game for whatever the script throws at him; I just wish they’d thrown more? It’s a lukewarm effort, but likable enough to sand over a very uninspired plot. You could legit do without all of the CIA stuff. Just cut it out. It is just empty air. The memorabilia scene is good. I wish the movie had been more of that. The Paddington 2 scene…I think it’s still too early to reference Paddington 2 in other movies. That’s just me, though. You do you. Phil Tippett spending 30 or so years to make this is a hell of a thing. More of a sensory experience than anything, but a punishing one, bent on pulling you into the depths of Tippett’s inferno. I wouldn’t last 5 minutes in this hellhole he imagined. I think that’s the point. Stunning imagery, blistering tone, downright horrifying in spurts, bleakly humorous in others. I really hope Tippett watched a lot of Seinfeld while he made this, or took a lot of really calm walks by the beach. This movie needed some Paddington 2 jokes, not The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. It’d be funny to me if they played this for a crowded theater full of kids instead of Minions: The Rise of Gru. Mad God…for the whole family! Not bad! Not quite among Eastwood’s best, but a very entertaining and well-made courtroom drama with some unexpected personality. It’s a damn shame Kevin Spacey is a criminal because he’s quite good in this and usually everything he does. John Cusack is also a fascinating foil, but I genuinely have no idea what type of journalist or writer he was and what his ethical boundaries were. Writing a book might open him up a bit to be more friendly with the subject, but if he’s an actual journalist, this is a crash course in how not to cover something. Nevertheless, a really good watch! It has its flaws, but it’s Eastwood, and the Lady Chablis (RIP) alone makes up for most of the slips-ups. What a performance! Bummed she didn’t get a chance to do more in the movies. Respect always to my Uncle Bobby for taking me to see this when I was 11. My brother was 9, and he was there, too. Special night! My mom had no idea. The “Luck of the Irish” gag is still to this day one of the funniest things from that absurdly great 00s comedy run, capped without peer by that Joel David Moore “that’s how he wanted to go out” line. I mean, you can’t do it better. The way he sells it, and the look on the guy next to him. The Lance Armstrong gag and like … okay let’s be real 15% of the very dated/probably offensive jokes you could do without. Outside of that, always one of the best studio comedies of its time during a time when studios actually made comedies. What a concept! I don’t want to be some sort of jackass and try to act like I know what happened in this movie because obviously *I have no idea,* but I’m pretty sure it’s about people who can’t let go of the past to the point where they become stuck there and can’t leave. So basically the Eagles watched this, said ‘wait a second,’ and wrote “Hotel California.” It’s also got the world’s most amped-up organ player going HAM on every stanza."
"Jun 8, 2022",positive,Gratuitously extenuating retina trips... A nightmare in its own right that portrays the tragedy and the end of a treacherous and ultra-masculinized world. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Jun 8, 2022",positive," In 914 AD, a young Amleth (Oscar Novak) bears witness to the betrayal of all he knows. His father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) is slaughtered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who claims his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) as his own. Narrowly escaping the odds against him, he is accepted by a neighboring Viking tribe, growing powerful under a personal vow of vengeance. When the adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) learns from a fallen seeress (Björk) his opportunity is at hand, the warrior disguises himself as a slave to fulfill his destiny, befriending Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) to aid him in his dire task. Biding his time to ensure a vengeance true to his word, revelations come to light as Amleth’s relationship with Olga grows, leaving him torn between what he is sworn to do and the potential rewards of abandoning his oath. Writer / director Robert Eggers has grand ideas, a visual style, and a healthy preoccupation with legend, morality tales, and mysticism. His freshman film The VVitch (also starring Anya Taylor-Joy) was well-received but met with mixed audience reaction, similar to his followup The Lighthouse (also starring Willem Dafoe who appears in The Northman as Heimir The Fool). With his latest film steeped in the old legends that also inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet — and some would add Disney’s The Lion King — Eggers soaks his production in destiny, ritual, and testosterone. Channeling a modern Conan the Barbarian mixed with bits of “Game of Thrones” and The 13th Warrior (which also draws from Beowulf), The Northman might be the director’s most mainstream film to date, but can it find an audience eager for its spectacle? Iceland is the backdrop for the old world of The Northman in the same way New Zealand became Middle-Earth for The Lord of the Rings; the sweeping expanse and wide spaces make this intimate epic feel larger and more affecting than it should and serves the story well. Some scenes appear almost black and white beneath gray overcast skies until interrupted by a flicker of firelight or a splash of blood, but not to the extreme of stylized films like 300 or Sin City. Eggers keeps everything grounded and practical as safely allowed. Alexander Skarsgård has stepped up his game, both in acting and training to look the part; it’s an amusing coincidence  it also feels like a potential backstory for his character Erik Northman on HBO’s “True Blood” series. The director has crafted an immersive experience that is decidedly adult, telling a classic tale as well as it can be told with a flare for the dramatic and death as a constant companion. Earning its running time of just over two hours, it boasts a single moment of amusement and a lifetime of satisfaction. Half of the top-listed cast makes only a brief appearances, although the way Willem Dafoe’s character is given extra screen time is as ghastly as it is wonderful. Nicole Kidman lends her craft to bring another matriarch to life, exceeding her similar role in Aquaman. Anya Taylor-Joy is ethereal as always, playing Olga as more aware than everyone thinks and smart enough to hide it from her enemies. The Northman’s world is built upon men ruling and women wanting… unless they’re the cunning kind of woman who learn to elevate their station, the queens and spiritualists who survive those seated upon thrones. Beastly warriors, assassinated kings, and soothsaying seers look down upon a brutal landscape where the common person could be free one moment and conquered the next with little to say in how their fate will play out.  With outlandish war preparations and coming-of-age scenes ready-made for after-hour Renaissance festival drum circles, Eggers goes all-in with his low-fantasy Dungeons & Dragons settings. The spectacle of it makes for great storytelling, but the plot hinges on the idea that “this is not the way,” punctuated with a father’s admission that one doesn’t know each day whether they’ll awaken as a king or a slave, and it’s best to be prepared for both. Because Robert Eggers has since announced his desire to tackle Nosferatu, sadly, we must wait."
"Jun 7, 2022",positive," We know we know. We need to get better about always reviewing things in a timely manner here at TFE. Here are quick takes on some movies we have said too little about -- at least in a reviewish kind of way, two of which we'd heartily recommend and one quite unexpectedly... In the same way as we wondered ""Is it necessary?"" when Spielberg announced that he would remake West Side Story, we must now get used to the idea that Ben Aflleck is going to remake Witness for the Prosecution. Is it necessary? I can't find it anywhere, but I am dying to see the French version of Deep Water since I was informed of its existence. Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Louis Trintigant play the leads. Enough said. I don't think Affleck or Skarsgard have much screen presence. There's a bland oatmeal vibe to them that I can never get past. But I'll probably see The Northman for Bjork and Kidman. It came and went so fast, I did not realize that AbmbuLAnce was stylized that way, and now I'm newly annoyed at a movie that barely exists. I swear, if someone tied him up to a chair and forced him to watch a Bela Tarr film.  I believe that his head will explode.  Michael Bay is and always will be the worst filmmaker working today. I swear, if someone tied him up to a chair and forced him to watch a Bela Tarr film.  I believe that his head will explode.  Michael Bay is and always will be the worst filmmaker working today."
"Jun 7, 2022",positive," “The Northman” underwent an intense series of reshoots last year, this after politely received test screenings put a damper on the possibility of it being released in 2021. Eggers’ third feature has had a somewhat problematic journey thus far. What we have here is an ambitious and massive film that is said to have a $90 million budget. Its screenplay was co-written by Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón Sigurdsson, but the ambiguously spooky storytelling of Eggers’ earlier films is replaced with a more mainstream approach here. That’s perfectly fine. This isn’t the kind of movie that will break any sort of cinematic mold, but it’s rousingly entertaining stuff. Watch it on the big screen with a large audience, if you can. “Never discount a true filmmaker, even with studio interference. “The Northman” runs 140 minutes and I was never bored, and that means something these days. It feels, obviously, very familiar, as it’s based on the legend of Amleth, which inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, but it’s incredibly well–directed.” “What “The Northman” lacks is the artful ambiguity of Eggers’ first two films, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse”. The influence of studio notes is apparent throughout.” “But it’s not that much of a slog, and despite a little too much CG with a climax happening at the mouth of an active volcano, two naked men fighting, not the best endin, Hollywood doesn’t really make epics of this kind anymore.“ “You can tell Eggers wanted a more elevated, visually-driven movie but the reshoots made it more ‘entertaining.’ Hopefully a director’s cut shows up someday, more of a pure Eggers version. The off-the-top influences are “Hamlet”, “Gladiator” and Game of Thrones”. “Alexander Skarsgaard’s lead performance is stellar. Ethan Hawke, as Skarsgaard’s murdered king-father, is in the film for maybe 10 minutes. Nicole Kidman, Hawke’s wife-queen, has a few scenes (her screen time comes to roughly 20 minutes) that she just nails. Anya Taylor Joy cuts a vivid figure, but a terrible accent.” “How many heads are split open with axes? I’d say about a dozen. The killings are extremely brutal. A fair amount of intestine spilling. There’s some kind of nod to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, he reports, and the skull of Yorick makes an appearance.”"
"Jun 3, 2022",negative," Borges, el hombre que sabía todo de los libros, aunque confesara haber cometido el mayor de los pecados, o sea, no haber sido feliz, declaró muchas veces su amor y admiración incondicionales a las leyendas escandinavas y a las sagas islandesas. Imperdonablemente las desconozco. Imagino que el coguionista y el director de El hombre del norte las han devorado. Y, por supuesto, han leído a un tal Shakespeare, la persona que mejor ha descrito con palabras lo que ocurre en el cerebro y en el corazón de la gente. En esta película existe eco no solo de personajes como Hamlet. También de Macbeth y Ricardo III. Al servicio de una historia con pretensiones de espectáculo, de llevar a los cines al gran público, algo que solo consigue últimamente ese cine tan vacuo, bobo, clónico, fabricado por computadora, que lleva el sello de la factoría Marvel. Lleva la firma del director estadounidense Robert Eggers, avalado con prestigio crítico, aunque no entienda los motivos, ya que su aclamada El faro me pareció una tontería pretenciosa, inútilmente retorcida, complacientemente violenta, insoportable. En El hombre del norte la violencia no es psicológica, sino ante todo física, incluyendo más de una imagen de gente con los intestinos colgando. La venganza obsesiva protagoniza su temática. La que planea un hombre, cuyo padre, rey de Islandia, fue asesinado por su felón y traidor hermano cuando él era un crío. Y también se casó con la viuda. A lo largo de dos horas, que no me resultan aburridas, pero tampoco apasionantes, este ser prematuramente destrozado sobrevive duramente como esclavo, con el único fin de matar al que causó su desdicha. También aspira a liberar a su madre de la persona que destrozó a su familia. Pero habrá sorpresas con poder alucinatorio para el vengador. El pasado está lleno de aristas. Y se agradece el giro perverso del guion. La sórdida realidad huye de lo que podría ser adecuado o convencional. El hombre del norte posee cierta fuerza visual, también un ritmo adecuado a la brutalidad que están describiendo. Puedes acabar saturado de tantas peleas, del desparrame de vísceras, de enfrentamientos feroces. Todo es primitivo y salvaje. Miembros cercenados, sangre interminable, gritos y aullidos. Con el alivio de una historia de amor con presente tan crudo como pocas esperanzas de futuro. Al sombrío protagonista lo encarna el chico de moda, Alexander Skarsgård, hijo de ese actor modélico y sobrio llamado Stellan Skarsgård. Por ahora, prefiero al padre. Y aunque resulten inicialmente irreconocibles, también aparecen secundarios de lujo, como Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawke y la enigmática Björk, haciendo lógicamente de bruja. Pero el trabajo que más me convence es el de la siempre creíble actriz Nicole Kidman. Su careto lleva mucho tiempo alterado o tieso por el comprensible terror al envejecimiento, pero su talento permanece intacto, haciendo de buena o de mala. Al llegar a mi casa vuelvo a ver, después de mucho tiempo, la deliciosa La princesa prometida. No es casual. Como El hombre del norte, habla de una venganza, plagada de duelos entre espadachines, peleas, personajes pintorescos, una historia de amor que el destino no pudo quebrar. Todo es de broma, con el humor y la ironía protagonizando situaciones graciosas y delirantes, con capacidad para captar la atención y la pasión de un crío enfermo al que su abuelo le lee un libro. Todo es imaginativo e inteligente en esta preciosa película, empezando por el extraordinario guion de William Goldman. Me duermo pensando en ella. No en El hombre del norte."
"Jun 3, 2022",positive," Robert Eggers aka Bobby Eggs is back, this time with a Viking epic featuring the talents of a Skarsgaard and Bjork. Does he bring us the blockbuster we've been advertised, or another classic Eggers indie pic? Is this this film that wins over Brian? We're talking all things NORTHMAN this week before Weekly Recommends and after a lil update on the 2022 Movie Draft."
"Jun 1, 2022",positive," The story: In this Viking saga set mainly in Iceland, Prince Amleth (played by Oscar Novak as a child and Alexander Skarsgard as an adult) witnesses the murder of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), at the hands of his uncle Fjolnir (Danish actor Claes Bang). Fjolnir also kidnaps his mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Amleth grows into a warrior and a witch (musician-actress Bjork) starts him on his path of vengeance, where he meets priestess Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). His first two features, released to acclaim, were works of horror. The Witch (2015, starring Taylor-Joy in her breakthrough) and The Lighthouse (2019), with their eloquent wordiness, spawned Internet memes. The films were unabashed love letters to gnarled old things living in realms beyond time. Norse warriors of old are revered in heavy-metal music and comic books and recently have been featured in drama series. Eggers, with Icelandic novelist and co-screenwriter Sjon, consider most pop-culture depictions inaccurate. Here, in a screenplay adapted from a legend (one that supposedly inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet), Vikings are superstitious slavers and bloodlust-driven fighters. But they are also settled, relatively wealthy pastoralists and merchants with trade links with the remnants of the Roman Empire. The story stays close to realism in another way. It holds that the legends are true and in the 10th century, the beings of Norse mythology - such as the Valkyries (female spirits guiding the dead to the next world) and the Fenrir (the giant wolf god) - were real. It goes without saying that one's fate is inescapable. But if you go in expecting this to be paced like a Marvel movie, you will be disappointed. The beats are much slower and, when supernatural creatures appear, they do so like the Great Eagles in The Lord Of The Rings films (2001 to 2003). They unravel a knotty plot problem, then vanish."
"Jun 1, 2022",neutral," Robert Eggers returns to the big screen for The Northman, an epic historical action drama that serves as his most ambitious, high-budget project yet. A career that began with low-budget horror films The Witch and The Lighthouse, Eggers has arrived in theaters with a good, old-fashioned revenge thriller. The emphasis here is on old-fashioned, as he masterfully transports us back to 895 A.D. for a movie about Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Viking on a mission to kill his uncle, who killed Amleth’s father and kidnapped his mother two decades prior. This is a triumphant effort from Eggers to tell a more mainstream narrative while keeping in tune with his distinct stylings. Those who have seen Eggers’s previous work know that he is partial to graphic, surreal imagery carefully constructed to be as evocative as possible. Eggers brings some of that to The Northman, giving his characters striking visions that lead to a beautifully unique cinematic experience. At the same time, he crafts a story of vengeance that serves the characters very well. Amleth’s words, “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir,” echo through the screen. At its core, the story is conventional. Amleth’s journey is what originally inspired The Tragedy of Hamlet, with the protagonists’ names serving as anagrams. Eggers tells a very Shakespearean tale, opening with a gripping prologue that introduces the audience to Amleth as a child. Oscar Novak does an incredible job in his scenes as young Amleth, and he shares the screen well with Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe, who provide excellent work with their brief screen time. As they perform a spiritual ceremony on all fours, their dedication to the craft is admirable. They behave like animals and sell a scene that could have been lost without the right performers and direction. What Eggers has mastered as a filmmaker is transporting his audience into a time entirely different from our own. Once his films begin, total immersion starts as you enter an experience unlike any other. The craftsmanship and attention to detail in every bit of The Northman are stunning, with believable, immaculate production design. While some films set in the past make the mistake of having everything feel polished and artificial, this movie is gritty, with dirty costumes in settings that complement the film’s dark tone. This is also Eggers’s first venture into large-scale action sequences. While the film’s focus isn’t the action, the movie features some of the most gripping battle sequences of the year. There are long takes with copious amounts of bloody, brutal violence that can be shocking. The barbarity of every insane fight scene matches the fierce nature of the Vikings and demonstrates the strength of Amleth as he embarks on his plan of vengeance. Skarsgård, who has shown his physical prowess in The Legend of Tarzan, outshines himself with his masterful stuntwork in this film. As far as the film’s story goes, the easiest complaint is that it uses familiar ingredients. Amleth’s goal of revenge is conventional, but it is perhaps the only accessible aspect of a movie that is uninterested in making things relatable for a 21st-century audience. The film is based on a classic legend, and Eggers does an excellent job of putting his artistic voice onto it. The second act can slow down at times, but the sublime cinematography and the performances are very engaging. Anya Taylor-Joy continues to outdo herself as an actress, and Nicole Kidman is phenomenal, as is Claes Bang as the film’s antagonist. Eggers also knew the right moments to bring his characters into dramatic directions, with a shocking revelation that pushes the protagonist into dark places. The Northman is an exceptionally crafted film with unconventional visuals and a filmmaking voice behind it that is powerfully unique. There is graphic violence and dark moments all over this film, and it is a story brought to life wonderfully by a cinematic auteur. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 7 equates to “Good.” A successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out, but it may not appeal to everyone. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films."
"May 31, 2022",positive," Blood runs, mud flies and bones crack — in crisp, percussive ways you’ve hopefully never heard in real life — throughout The Northman, a grand, gut-spilling Norse epic that feels at once earthily ancient and thrillingly modern. Plunging us into a Viking Age of elemental survival strategies and unfettered masculine brutality, Robert Eggers’ film shows off all the immersive world-building a huge Hollywood budget can buy, minus any obvious studio lacquer: everything here feels whittled from stone, woven from flesh, grown from the ground up, and then destroyed in a frenzy of bruising, exactingly choreographed warfare. By the time Björk shows up in a cameo — her first film appearance in 17 years — as a hollow-eyed mystic, you feel genuinely transported to another dimension. The Northman is a film touched by madness, that also happens to know exactly what it’s doing. With so much overwhelming sensory detail at play,  Eggers keeps the story back-of-a-postcard simple. When his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), is murdered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), young Prince Amleth flees and grows into the formidable form of Alexander Skarsgård, returning years later to avenge his father’s death, rescue his mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman, revealing complex layers of feminine desire and pragmatism in this testosterone-driven tale) and reclaim his kingdom. If it sounds familiar, that’s no accident. Eggers is working from the medieval Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which centuries later trickled down into Shakespeare’s Hamlet; in Hollywood terms, The Northman shares DNA with The Lion King, if not a whole lot else. But as with Eggers’ previous films, the febrile period visions The Witch and The Lighthouse, it’s less about the story, and more about the go-for-broke telling, from the rich, flavourful historical idiom in which he writes — this time in collaboration with revered Icelandic poet Sjón — to the vast, visceral, carved-in-wood imagery that gives the words their weight. Meanwhile, the stripped, linear narrative is complicated by an anxious, uncertain moral conscience that you don’t find in, say, Gladiator: Amleth is unwaveringly determined to have his revenge in this life or the next, yet as much as we understand his motives, the more he slashes and slays his way toward that goal, the more we question its value. Disturbing and exhilarating at once, The Northman is troubled by toxic cycles of male violence, even as it gets us waist-deep in battle."
"May 29, 2022",positive," Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, who is determined to win back the kingdom stolen from his father, in Robert Eggers’ “The Northman.” (Photo by Aidan Monaghan, courtesy of Focus Features.) Like the muscular fighter and the seductive sorceress at its heart, Robert Eggers’ “The Northman” besieges and bewitches the viewer in equal measure with its realistically bloody and enthrallingly haunted view of life among the Vikings. It’s near the end of the 10th century C.E., and a Viking castle is awaiting the return of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and his cohort from their latest battles. The queen, Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), prepares for the king’s arrival, as is their teen son, Amleth (Oscar Novak). Aurvandil takes Amleth on a vision quest — involving a steam hut, psychedelics and the leering jester, Helmir (Willem Dafoe) — that’s the first step of the lad’s eventual ascension to his dad’s throne. But Arvandil’s brother, Fjölnir (Danish actor Claes Bang), has other ideas. He leads a group of soldiers to assassinate the king, kidnap Gudrun, and declare himself the new king. The only mistake Fjölnir makes is letting Amleth get away. The lad rows a small boat out to sea, with three vows on his lips: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Years pass, and Amleth — played as a strapping adult by Alexander Skarsgård — is still reciting those vows, but as a soldier in a mercenary army. After his group pillages a village, he rescues a Slavic maiden, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), from getting killed in the melee. When he hears Olga is being shipped off with some newly enslaved villagers to Iceland, where Fjölnir now lives, Amleth becomes a slave himself to join the voyage and finally exact his revenge. In Iceland, Amleth discovers Fjölnir has already lost Aurvandil’s kingdom, and the new settlement he leads is managed through fear by Fjölnir’s sniveling prince, Thórir (Gustav Lindh), who looks like a Dark Ages version of Jared Kushner. Amleth works cautiously at first, scoping out Fjölnir’s new kingdom before taking it down. Amleth also teams with Olga, who is as ruthless as he is. “Your strength breaks men’s bones,” Olga tells Amleth, adding, “I have the cunning to break their minds.” Eggers — as he did in his first two films, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” — creates a world where harsh reality and mysticism live side by side. In long, fluid takes, Eggers captures the unrelenting violence of marauders ransacking villages and slaughtering the locals. But the script, which Eggers wrote with the Icelandic writer Sjón (“Lamb”), also leaves room for psychedelic spirit journeys, visits with vision-seeing priestesses (one of them played by Björk), and the influence of dreams on Amleth’s gory reality. Taylor-Joy, following her run that included “The Queen’s Gambit” and “Last Night in Soho,” continues to be one of the most fascinating young stars to watch. Kidman makes the most out of her one surprising moment, and Bang (“The Square,” “The Burnt Orange Heresy”) brings a weary menace to the traitorous Fjölnir. But “The Northman” forces all eyes toward Skarsgård, who presents Amleth as a brawny, brooding hero who must learn that the childhood ideas of vengeance must inevitably yield to the adult reality that many things are not what they appear to be.  Fans of “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” low-budget movies that orchestrated an atmosphere of dread, were going to be curious what Eggers could do on a larger scale. What he’s created is an authentic-looking and dream-filled world of a thousand years ago, sometimes beautiful and often brutal — but always fascinating."
"May 28, 2022",positive," A savage and mesmerizing Viking saga like no other, Robert Eggers’ The Northman leaves your senses bludgeoned by the time the credits roll. Like The Witch and The Lighthouse, which made Eggers an indie horror darling, his latest has an obsessive intrigue with pastoral history, baroque language, and pagan mythology, albeit on a much larger scale. With a budget of nearly 90 million dollars, this visually striking odyssey is distinguished by its heavily researched set pieces, authentic costuming, dreamlike vistas, and visceral, bone-cracking battle sequences. It’s the 9th century in Scandinavia as we’re introduced to Prince Amleth, the son of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). When the battle-weary ruler returns to his dilapidated kingdom and beautiful wife, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), after years of fighting wars and scouring the countryside, he takes young Amleth to a sage (Willem Defoe) for an initiation ceremony where they ingest psychedelics, howl like dogs, and experience visions of their family tree. This is pure Robert Eggers’ territory – a dark realm where uncertainty, paranoia and magic coexist. The spell quickly ends however, when the child witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) murder his father. As the boy escapes into the wilderness, he vows to avenge his father and save his mother from his uncle’s tyranny. Several years later, a bearded and sinewy Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) travels the Scandinavian countryside with other grunting, homicidal Vikings. These musclebound marauders invade small villages and decimate entire families before feasting on their food and wine. One night, after a particularly brutal skirmish, Amleth encounters a bejeweled Seeress (Bjork) who informs him that his uncle fled to Iceland with his mother who he recently took as his bride. With his thirst for revenge rekindled, Amleth jumps on a ship and insinuates himself with a group of slaves bound for Iceland, including the alluring Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). From here, the movie ratchets up the tension as Amleth aims to exact his revenge on his uncle. If the story sounds familiar (a young man avenging his father’s murder by the uncle who married his mother), you probably heard of a play called Hamlet. Inspired by the same Scandinavian folktale, you can discern the contours of that play in the film’s narrative. Eggers simply exhumed its bones and slapped some muscle on it. Instead of a brooding Danish prince who wails, “To be or not to be,” our hero is a twisted ball of hate and cunning. He’s not apprehensive about killing his uncle as much as enjoying the process of tormenting him. It’s Shakespeare on psychedelics and Swedish Death Metal. If The Northman shares anything with other Hamlet adaptations, it’s the spiritual exploration of moral uncertainty, which questions the glory in killing another man, even if it’s justified. Co-written by Eggers and Sjon (Lamb), the film is not without a misstep or two. In constructing a world where loathing, lust and violence are a way of life, the filmmakers forgo levity and human empathy. Although we understand Amleth philosophically, we don’t feel an emotional connection to him or anyone else. A little nuance and humor would’ve gone a long way, especially since Eggers’ somber tone and often incoherent antediluvian dialogue already keeps us at a distance. But these are modest gripes for a work that achieves greatness on such an impressive canvas. Every frame of Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography is a carefully rendered baroque painting, while the score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough pushes us deeper into the ether with transcendent rhythms and primordial drums. Taking cues from films like Excalibur and Conan the Barbarian, Eggers is able to weave hypnotic hallucinatory sequences into the film’s embroidery without losing sight of the central plot. It also never hurts to have a remarkable cast. Skarsgard inhabits Amleth with such ferocity, you wonder if he had a mental breakdown on set. Bang’s murderous uncle balances repressed rage and existential confusion with an amazing fluidity, while Kidman’s Queen Gudrun absolutely slays. She’s frightening. And the always mesmerizing Taylor Joy adds a bit of romance and grace to a movie brimming with machismo. The real star however is the movie’s ethereal and paranoid atmosphere, which Eggers crafts with a sculptor’s precision. He’s proven himself to be a genuine filmmaker. Unlike a lot of contemporary directors who edit their movies like overly eager children on a sugar high, Eggers brings a sense of patience and curiosity. With a Kurosawa-esqe flair, he uses long tracking shots and detailed production designs to pull you into the dark landscape, while maintaining an undercurrent of menace. Even if some of the thinly drawn characters get buried under a mountain of mud, bone, and gristle, The Northman is a compelling experience. It’s also one of the most brutal and astonishing films of the year."

"May 27, 2022",positive," Imagine being Robert Eggers right now. Stunning audiences in 2105 with the captivating The Witch (and also introducing them to the incredible Anya Taylor-Joy), following up in 2019 with the near-indescribable The Lighthouse – we’re now here with an epic for the ages. A feast for the senses, Norse mythology has never looked this good on the big screen nor felt as vitally visceral. What follows is a cinematic marvel. Continuing his partnership with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, the signature visual style with Eggers is present, correct and as brutally beautiful as we would expect. Each shot is a feast for the eyes – there’s something hauntingly captivating about every single frame. And there’s much to be haunted by here. This is a film that is as vicious and violent as you would hope for from a tale with these origins. It’s to point of near-ecstatic deliciousness that we bare witness to such primal and pulsating savagery. The reason it is so compelling is the substance that comes with the ascetic. Skarsgård in particular is a tour-de-force, a hulking embodiment of unbridled obsession with fate & destiny. It feels wrong to describe his undeterred quest for retribution as a pleasure to watch yet, thanks to Eggers at the helm it genuinely is. Within the barbarity, there’s wonderful teasing out on the threads than bind and drive us – how humans are dammed to follow a path that is not of their own choosing. "

"May 23, 2022",positive," Con solo dos películas en su haber: La bruja (2015), una de las cumbres del terror contemporáneo, y El faro (2019), una pesadilla expresionista que mezclaba en un salto sin red terror y comedia bruta, el cineasta norteamericano Robert Eggers da el salto a las grandes superproducciones (90 millones de dólares) de la mano de Universal y Focus Features con El hombre del norte, una película de vikingos -¡gran subgénero que nos ha dado películas de la talla de Los vikingos (1958) de Richard Fleischer o La furia de los vikingos (1961) de Mario Bava!-, que cruza el folk horror más lisérgico -hay mucha brujería e iconografía pagana absolutamente deliciosa- con la violencia más salvaje y gore que uno se pueda llevar a la cara (algo realmente poco habitual en los blockbusters norteamericanos). El cineasta la ha definido como un cruce entre Andrei Rublev (1966) de Andrei Tarkovsky y Conan el bárbaro (1982) de John Milius, una definición tan atrevida como acertada, a la que habría que añadir algo del nihilismo bruto de una de las joyas del género como es Valhalla Rising (2009) de Nicolas Winding Refn. El hombre del norte es una historia de venganza clásica ancestral de la literatura nórdica. Tanto es así que dicen que inspiró a Shakespeare para su Hamlet (1603), de ahí que el protagonista, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), sólo cambie una hache de sitio en su nombre. La raíz shakesperiana, en la línea de Trono de sangre (1957) de Akira Kurosawa, donde también se mezclaba las traiciones familiares y los asesinatos descarnados con el horror brujeril, es clara en la película de Eggers, donde el protagonista buscará saborear la sangre de su tío Fjölnir (un buen Claes Bang), responsable del asesinato de su padre (Ethan Hawke) y nuevo marido de su madre (Nicole Kidman, pocas veces tan aterradora como en esta película).  El hombre del norte  llega a las pantallas no sin polémica, tras las quejas del realizador por la injerencia de la major a la hora de realizar cambios sobre el corte final, al parecer, tras no haber funcionado del todo bien los “test screenings” realizados. Posición que el mismo Eggers ha debido aclarar esta misma semana diciendo que dichos cambios, al final, han mejorado la película al hacerla más accesible. Como no tengo ni la más remota idea de qué significa toda esa cháchara, vamos a hacer oídos sordos a la algo desastrosa campaña de marketing de la película (posters promocionales inclusive) y centrarnos en el resultado final que sí hemos podido ver. Y, visto lo visto, creo que El hombre del norte, incluso aún más que Dune (2021), es uno de los blockbuster de autor más brutales, a contracorriente y suicida que se hayan podido ver en pantalla grande. Eggers cambia de escala pero lo hace sin dejarse nada por el camino de aquello que convierte su cine en tan excitante y aterrador.  Jugando entre la abstracción, como digo, con una contundente iconografía terrorífica vikinga -la labor de documentación histórica y artística ha debido ser tremendamente exhaustiva-, y la fisicidad más visceral y gutural que uno pueda llevarse a la cara -es incontable el número de desmembraciones vistas en la película-, Eggers buscar que su Hamlet tenga fuertes raíces dramáticas -qué bien le sienta a la película el contrapeso romántico con el personaje de Anya Taylor-Joy- que luego no duda en solucionar con sólida densidad emocional y un placer por el gore analógico que hace que todas las películas de super-héroes por comparación parezcan Peppa Pig.  La película, claro, no deja de ser algo realmente extraño, pero extraño en la línea de la sublime El caballero verde (2021) de David Lowery: una puesta en escena magnífica, entre lo alambicado y lo brutalmente directo, en una narración que avanza sin miedo hacia el fatalismo existencial. Ojalá la taquilla responda a tan arriesgada propuesta."
"May 23, 2022",positive,"Nicole Kidman steals her scenes in this immaculately crafted tale of revenge. The action brings the heat, but the story may leave you cold. "
"May 20, 2022",positive," Although Robert Eggers has only three feature films to his name so far, audiences already know what to expect from his work. Otherworldly, weird, intensely individual and universal at the same time, with a strange sense of humor and a fascination with esoteric within a well-worn mythic structure, Eggers’s films examine the heart of darkness within cultures at once foreign and deeply familiar. Whether or not he’s always successful in his project, he’s yet to make an uninteresting film, and he hasn’t broken that streak yet. His latest, The Northman, is a Norse epic, feminist diatribe, and family drama in one, and is exactly what you’d expect from the director  and writer of The Witch and The Lighthouse. The Northman follows Amleth (Alexander Skarsgaard), the son of King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) and Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), who vows vengeance when his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) murders his father and kidnaps his mother. As a child, Amleth escapes the assassination to join a band of marauding Vikings, and we next see him laying waste to a Slavic village and carrying off the strongest inhabitants as slaves. When a chance encounter leads Amleth to discover where his uncle has gone, he believes the fates have given him the opportunity to fulfill his promise. He disguises himself as a slave to be transported to Iceland, where his uncle, mother, and cousins tend a sheep farm. There he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Slavic woman who complicates his single-minded quest for vengeance. If Eggers’s previous films were difficult and confounding, The Northman is far more accessible…but that’s no knock against it, nor does it reduce the cultural or mythological complexity of the narrative. Eggers has a clear concept of the genre in which he’s working and brings similar sensibilities about faith and horror that he did to his first two films. Despite being on a grander scale, The Northman is just as claustrophobic and intimate as its predecessors—the windswept oceans and mountains of Norway and Iceland replace the wilds of Puritan New England and the crashing waves of the Atlantic Ocean, but are still the sites of isolation and intense interpersonal relationships shaped by social and religious systems, and individual psychosis. In Eggers’s films, the characters are embedded in their society, its cultures and traditions and faiths, and are shaped by it, victims and victimizers alike. He understands, perhaps better than any of his contemporaries, the violence inherent in the system and the circuitous nature of trauma. The story evades glorifying Norse or Viking culture while respecting the world in which the characters live. Amleth is trapped in a circle of trauma and toxicity, but he has the choice to break free from it—the superstructure of the narrative itself does not require his sacrifice, as it does Oedipus or even Hamlet. The film rather supposes that it is his belief in his fate that traps him within the cycle. Olga presents an alternative, a worship of the earth and the offer of rebirth, that Amleth begins to work towards. But it is Amleth’s culture of destruction and patriarchy that seems to doom him; without mincing words, Eggers exposes the cult of death inherent in toxic masculinity. The Northman deftly appears to be about one thing while slyly indicating that it will be about something else. As with The Witch and The Lighthouse, Eggers utilizes a deceptively straightforward story informed by legend or myth (a family plagued by a witch, two men stranded in a lighthouse, a son taking vengeance for the murder of his father) to explore the complexities within the cultures he depicts and attempt to say something about our own. Eggers returns to myth and legend again and again, in different milieus, yes, but with the same basic idea—to dig into the past that has so shaped our current culture. In its own way, The Northman is a challenging film by being so deceptively simple; it refuses easy categorization (this is not a Norse fantasy epic, as much as some PR firms want it to be) and utilizes the recognizable narrative to interweave a deeply complex mythos of history, religion, superstition, and legend. It contains spectacular performances and a writer/director who has only become more assured in his work as time has gone on. While the violence, blood, and mud won’t be for everyone, The Northman is a rewarding film for those who venture into its wilderness."
"May 20, 2022",negative,"A historical epic without the epic, a revenge plot with all the agency of revenge removed. What is left?  A two and a half hour plodding viking re-enactment."
"May 20, 2022",positive," 
Robert Eggers, one of the most vital contemporary American film-makers thanks to his uniquely captivating movies The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), scales things up considerably for this historical epic about a Viking prince's
quest for vengeance.
 Sometime around the 10th century, a Scandinavian king (Ethan Hawke) returns home from war to his queen (Nicole Kidman) and adolescent son Amleth (Oscar Novak). After partaking in a ritualistic rite of passage with his father, Amleth witnesses the king's brother, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), murder his father. Thought dead, Amleth escapes, vowing revenge, and grows up to be a hulk of a man played by Alexander Skarsgard, now with considerable abilities as a killer honed by years of being a Viking berserker. After an especially bloody raid (which includes a bravura single-shot sequence in which Skarsgard pummels multiple poor souls), Amleth encounters a Seeress (played by Icelandic singer Bjork), who informs him that his opportunity for revenge will soon present itself. Sure enough, Amleth is able to get himself sold as a slave into his now-deposed uncle's ownership, where he plots to kill Fjolnir and rescue his mother, who is now Fjolnir's wife. Apparently spurred on by Swedish star Skarsgard's desire to make a Viking movie, Eggers teamed up with Icelandic novelist/poet Sjon to write the screenplay based on the myth that also inspired Hamlet. Both of Eggers' previous films demonstrate a proclivity for intense visions of the past informed by dream-like imagery and a grimy, muddy aesthetic. As you might imagine, those skills are very well-suited to a bloody Viking epic, and there is a wide variety of aesthetic wonders to behold here. In a post Game of Thrones world, it's a challenge to make anything medieval seem especially brutal or bold, but Eggers easily clears that bar, evoking a primal, mythic quality that widens the eyes. But although there is not a single dull moment in this big-budget fever dream, there is a minor sense that something has been lost, emotionally speaking, with Eggers working on such a large canvas. He may be slightly better suited to more intimate storytelling. That said, it feels like a miracle that this film exists, and it's worth celebrating for the pure artistic ambition of it all. Big swings like this are always a good thing. Skarsgard looks the part but can never quite shake a slight contemporary quality. The Witch breakout Anya Taylor-Joy is great as a fellow slave, and The Lighthouse star Willem Dafoe is a hoot in a brief role as a jester/soothsayer. Danish actor Bang is fantastic as well, but in the acting stakes, Kidman (who played Skarsgard's wife in Big Little Lies) is the real star player here, once again displaying her ability to draw upon unparalleled levels of intensity in her performing.

"May 19, 2022",positive," El hombre del Norte (The Northman, Estados Unidos/2022). Dirección: Robert Eggers. Guion: Sjón y Robert Eggers. Fotografía: Jarin Blaschke. Música: Robin Carolan y Sebastian Gainsborough. Edición: Louise Ford. Elenco: Alexander Skargard, Claes Bang, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, Willem Dafoe. Distribuidora: UIP. Duración: 136 minutos. Calificación: solo apta para mayores de 16 años. Nuestra opinión: buena. La nueva película de Robert Eggers era una de las más esperadas del año. Se había creado una corriente de genuina y generalizada curiosidad por saber cómo se manejaría el talentoso creador de La bruja y El faro por primera vez con muchísimos recursos a su disposición: una producción de elevada escala, una historia mucho más ambiciosa y un vasto elenco de estrellas. La elección de una historia tan intensa, brutal, impetuosa y feroz como la que se narra en El hombre del Norte completa el cuadro. Ya sabemos que Eggers no se impone límites ni reservas cuando se decide a explorar los vínculos entre lo real y lo fantástico en escenarios en los que prevalecen los rituales arcanos, los temores religiosos y las conductas primitivas. Por eso, no hay palabra mejor que “visceral”, en su más amplio significado, como síntesis compacta de todo lo que ocurre aquí. Abunda aquí la exposición de cuerpos abiertos y desgarrados en unas cuantas batallas muy cruentas y también el carácter simbólico del término: los personajes se dejan llevar todo el tiempo por comportamientos desbordados y hasta inmanejables desde lo emocional. Sobre todo cuando perciben que es imposible torcer el destino que se les asigna. Por eso, aunque la acción transcurra durante el siglo X de nuestra era en algún lugar de los dominios vikingos, el escenario real es el de una verdadera tragedia clásica no demasiado difícil de comprender. Un rey guerrero regresa al hogar tras una larga campaña con la certeza de que será traicionado y, a la vez, deberá apresurarse para pasar el legado de su corona a un hijo todavía adolescente. El heredero, testigo mudo del instante en que la traición se ejecuta con crueldad en el propio seno familiar, debe escaparse para no quedar arrastrado por ella. Muchos años después regresará para cumplir con su venganza, aunque el plan se torna cada vez más arduo con la aparición de detalles inesperados. Como en sus películas anteriores, Eggers parte de la certeza histórica para tomar impulso y moverse una vez más a partir de ellas en las difusas fronteras que separan a la realidad del mito. Se apoya en cuidadas referencias visuales y arqueológicas para mostrar cómo se vivía en ese hostil rincón del mundo azotado todo el tiempo por la crudeza del clima y la ferocidad de sus habitantes. Estamos en medio de un universo sellado a fuego por un espiral de violencia que parece retroalimentarse todo el tiempo y no terminar nunca. Quienes hayan visto El faro y La bruja encontrarán aquí marcas parecidas: ritos tribales y brujerías, conductas primitivas, constantes pulsiones sexuales (que hasta incluyen el fantasma del incesto), ceremonias de iniciación y de camaradería, tendencia al exceso. Lo que no se aprecia del todo en El hombre del Norte es aquello que rápidamente convirtió a Eggers en un creador provocativo, original, capaz de crear una fusión nueva y distinta entre varios géneros: el terror, el cine fantástico, el drama histórico. Con la notable ayuda de sus colaboradores habituales (el director de fotografía Jarin Blaschke, la vestuarista Louise Ford, los directores de arte Craig Lathrop y Robert Cowper) y un rodaje en espléndidos escenarios naturales de Islandia, Eggers logra sostener esa atmósfera a través de una sucesión de planos y secuencias de inquietante, magnética y poderosa belleza. Pero detrás de ellas hay aquí menos misterio y sorpresa que en sus obras anteriores. Por más que se asocien, por ejemplo, ciertas conductas humanas a comportamientos propios del reino animal (cuervos, osos, lobos), El hombre del Norte nos cuenta una historia de venganza no demasiado diferente a otras que hemos visto antes. Mucho más sangrienta, eso sí. En un elenco exigido por un gran compromiso físico y anímico, Alexander Skargard y Claes Bang aportan presencia y entrega absoluta. Anya Taylor-Joy se luce en un breve y enigmático personaje de gélida belleza y acento eslavo. Nicole Kidman viste de elocuente teatralidad su inquietante papel, y Björk, Ethan Hawke y Willem Dafoe apenas tienen tiempo para mostrarse. En cuanto a Eggers, queda claro que a ahora dispone de muchos más recursos para contar historias a su manera, pero todavía no termina de acomodarse a esta nueva realidad. Dijo, por ejemplo, que le hubiese gustado que toda la película se hablara en el nórdico antiguo que escuchamos aquí solo en los momentos ceremoniales. Para el resto debió resignarse al inglés que se utiliza cada vez que un cine con pretensiones quiere instalarse en tiempos antiguos o medievales. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"May 18, 2022",positive," Vikings in pop culture have gotten a bit too cozy as of late. Instead of depicting them as the bloodthirsty, pirating, raping warriors that they were, conquering every new land and leaving a bloody trail behind them, we’ve gotten a defanged version of the terrifying conquerors. While recent shows like Vikings and Vikings: Valhalla show a version of Vikings with a heart of gold (and not a slave in sight) and games like Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla romanticize the wandering journey and noble soul of a Viking, Robert Eggers’ The Northman does neither. I’m not saying the game and those shows don’t have their own merit, but The Northman is not trying to curry your favor for its berserker protagonist.  Based on the legend of Amleth which inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet (something you quickly notice once you watch the movie) the only thing familiar about the world of The Northman is its plot. Indeed, from hauntings to Yorick’s skull, the film doesn’t deviate too much from the soul of the story we’ve gotten to know so well. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is a Viking prince on the run after witnessing the murder of his father Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) by the hand of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). He escapes as a child, vowing to return for vengeance and to save his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman).  Years on his own, plagued and infected by hate and vengeance have turned Amleth into nothing short of a beast. It isn’t until, during one of his blood-soaked raids, where he meets a Seeress (Björk) that he is righted once more. Sailing to Iceland disguised as a slave alongside a Slavic witch named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), Amleth schemes and seethes. Unlike Eggers’ previous features, there’s very little that is surprising or unexpected when it comes to The Northman. Those who label it as horror are fundamentally misunderstanding what horror is. This is a revenge story, closer in relation to The Count of Monte Cristo than The Witch or The Lighthouse.  Instead, Eggers proves that the connecting thread in his films is a distinct and enchanting blend of the bizarre and arcane with dashes of folkloric magic and indulgence in fantasy. Instead of dabbling in magical realism and making us question what is real and what is superstition, it is all real for these characters. Just as Thomasin can live deliciously, so too can Amleth become beast-like and wield magical blades.  It’s inspiring to see that stories like this can still exist. Ones that aren’t afraid to push the boundaries between genres, because while dubbing The Northman as a historical epic isn’t necessarily wrong, it would be inaccurate. Along with its violence and costuming and dead languages, there is also a surprising amount of humor, romance, and fantasy. From burping and farting to pretending to be literal wolves, the scenes that brought me surprising mirth were funny because of their unflinching intensity. The situation, as a viewer from 2022, is entirely comical, but for the characters, it’s real. That’s not to say that you aren’t meant to laugh at some of those scenes, they’re meant to be ridiculous.  On the same note, the scenes between Amleth and Taylor-Joy’s Olga are surprisingly tender. Wrapped within this story of Hamlet could have been a burgeoning story of a young Lord and Lady Macbeth. Olga is equal parts ethereal and vicious, far from a shrinking violet, her alliance and connection to Amleth ground his character in something real. She’s not there to be beautiful Ophelia and die, she is his partner, his savior, and his purpose when he becomes rudderless. It’s touching, to see the man who was once nothing but muscle and loud screaming and grunting noises turn into open himself up to a Slavic witch and speak of the future. Eggers blends these genres and tones together effortlessly, in a way that seems so simple but is difficult to accomplish. In The Northman, Robert Eggers sheds the title of a horror director. He shows just how far his range can lead him, and it is exciting to see him lean into that. Fueling his stories with healthy doses of fantasy only serves to prove this point and adds an extra layer of excitement when I think of what fantastical story he’ll conquer next."
"May 17, 2022",positive,"  Robert Eggers has carved a niche for himself making visually arresting, thoroughly researched historical films with supernatural and folkloric overtones. It’s hyper specific and gave us two of the best movies of their kind of the past decade, The Witch from 2015 and  The Lighthouse from 2019. Both movies are deeply unsettling affairs exploring several universal themes in the weirdest ways possible. His newest movie, The Northman, is by far his least weird. That, consequently, also makes it my least favorite. It’s not a bad movie in the least, it just feels like a lot of the Eggers special sauce got watered down, even if the brutality went way, way up. The Northman‘s attention to period detail is perhaps the most impressive of Eggers’ whole career. The scope of something like this is massive, utilizing the vast, frigid landscape of Iceland to explore several different cultures melded through pillaging and slavery. Norse, Celtic, Rus, and Pict characters all occupy the screen at the same time and they each feel different in their own particular way. I never once doubted the veracity of any element on screen. It truly feels like a journey through history. What doesn’t quite have the same feeling of immersion is the story. A young Norse prince named Amleth witnesses his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke),  murdered at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), is therefore taken as Fjölnir’s new queen. Though Amleth is himself sought for death, he escapes in a boat, vowing to return one day to avenge his father, rescue his mother, and kill his uncle. Years later, Amleth is a Bear-Wolf Viking raider, now in the ab-having portrayal of Alexander Skarsgård, the beefiest Skarsgård. After ransacking a Russian village, Amleth overhears a tale of King Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom. He is little more than a town chieftain in Iceland, but Amleth’s hatred and fire for vengeance has not died. Amleth disguises himself as a slave, and joins a caravan heading to Fjölnir’s town. Along with a cunning young Rus maiden named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), Amleth plots the slow destruction of his uncle and everything he holds dear. But, as is always the question, will revenge truly sate his bloodlust? This is one of the oldest stories in the world. I don’t mean just because this movie takes place in the late-9th century AD; you have seen this story before. It’s Conan the Barbarian, it’s Hamlet, it’s at least 50% of all spaghetti westerns. The revenge story cannot exist without effectively turning the avenger into a beast who has to choose whether to succumb to their hatred or go down a more forgiving path. The body count goes way up while they decide, naturally. Certainly it’s not like The Northman is wholly without the trademark Eggers touches. The moments when the movie truly shines are when the narrative brings in elements of folklore and superstition. When Amleth begins his nighttime raids of his uncle’s farm, we get a bit of the Norse magic and mysticism. Fjölnir’s elder son Thórir (Gustav Lindt) believes it to be the heretical magic of the Christian slaves they’d acquired from Ireland. Olga uses “Earth magic” she picked up in Rus. We see Norse ritual sacrifices to the god Freyja. It’s a fascinating mélange of different influences. While the movie definitely has its fair share of cool elements like that—Björk as an eyeless seer is a standout, and Willem Dafoe as a weird jester-meets-mystic is another—it all too frequently feels like they are at the mercy of the narrative, which is as rote and pedestrian as it gets. I love a good revenge story, don’t get me wrong, but The Northman feels trapped by it rather than using it to explore any other greater themes. Both The Witch and The Lighthouse explore some fascinating avenues of toxic masculinity. They show us men who are in various ways impotent and unable to enact the change in their own lives. Which, of course, leaves them open to the otherworldly forces which inhabit the forest or the sea that surround them. Here, the toxic masculinity feels both horribly destructive and unchecked. Adult Amleth is a ball of rage from his first appearance to his last, literally roaring or howling like the animals he emulates. His actions therefore lead other men—notably, but not limited to, Fjölnir—to reply in kind. This does feel like the men here are in their own ways impotent, but we never see an opposite. Brutality begets brutality and, justified or not, brutality is all there shall be. The cast is excellent, the cinematography from Eggers’ regular collaborator Jarin Blaschke is gorgeous, and everything about the time period feels perfect and rich. And yet, I can’t help thinking about how much more David Lowery seemed to do with his Arthurian riff, The Green Knight, last year. It too is a hero’s journey of sorts, about a man with an unsure future attempting to follow or upend his fate. But it’s so much stranger, so much more interesting in a number of different ways, and seems to use its mystical and mythological elements to a greater level of effect. The Northman is a gorgeous, textured depiction of its place and time, with so much to recommend it on both sides of the camera. I just wish it had found something deeper to show us, a more nuanced story to tell than what we get. And it’s not like there aren’t plenty of opportunities. A couple of moments in the story had me saying “Oh wow, that’s interesting!” But they ultimately only broke the rhythm of the typical genre conventions briefly. The flow of the revenge movie could not be contained for long. If you have any interest in seeing a visual interpretation of a Viking epic at its pinnacle, I would recommend seeing The Northman wherever has the best sound and projection near you. It’s a beautiful looking movie. However, don’t go in expecting the unpredictability of The Witch or The Lighthouse, to which The Northman simply can’t hold a candle, or torch."
"May 17, 2022",positive," Con tan solo tres películas Robert Eggers se ha convertido en uno de los directores más atípicos y personales del cine contemporáneo. Su forma de crear atmósferas, sus conexiones con el folk horror, su estilización visual y la manera en la que a través de sus personajes nos conectamos con lo más oscuro del alma humana lo convierten en un creador de lo más atípico, enigmático, radical a la hora de llevar siempre un poco más allá su propia cosmogonía. En ese sentido, 'El hombre del norte' es su película más ambiciosa, no solo en cuanto a presupuesto, sino también a la hora de maximizar la experiencia telúrica y sensorial por encima del relato.  Eggers se adentra en el universo vikingo abrazando toda su mitología mística y la contrapone a la brutalidad intrínseca de los guerreros berseker. Este cruce se plasma en la pantalla a través de un trabajo tan físico y visceral como alucinógeno. Por eso, buena parte de sus escenas, planificadas casi al borde del delirio a través de largas tomas de una complejidad titánica, parecen enfocadas a sumergir al espectador en una experiencia estética hipnótica en la que la épica se da la mano con la locura expresiva. Es sucia, brutal, sanguinolenta, pero al mismo tiempo, de ella emana de una belleza sobrenatural.  'El hombre del norte' es una pesadilla shakesperiana en torno a la obsesión en la que campa a sus anchas la rabia, pero también la poesía, que está llena de ideas imaginativas, que tiene una grandilocuencia pictórica inabarcable e imágenes poderosas para el recuerdo.

"May 16, 2022",positive," Just seven years ago, a little-known filmmaker named Robert Eggers debuted his brilliant feature-length debut, The Witch—an extraordinary exploration of 17th-century religious hysteria, familial dysfunction, and folk horror. The unqualified critical praise that followed its Sundance premiere was more than justified. Four years later, Eggers returned with The Lighthouse, an equally brilliant 19th-century dissection of isolation, madness, and mermaids. His second effort all but confirmed his status as a world-class talent working in or out of the art-horror sub-genre. Only Eggers’s contemporary—writer-director Ari Aster— deserves to be discussed in similar terms of talent or output. Eggers conveyed his singular obsession with period authenticity into every meticulously hand-crafted frame, in every intentional camera move, and in every heavily researched line of mythopoetic dialogue. Adapted by Eggers with Icelandic poet-novelist Sjón (Lamb) from the same source material William Shakespeare used for the slightly better-known Hamlet, this third feature-length film, The Northman, centres on Amleth (Oscar Novak), a prince and heir to a minor kingdom ruled by Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) and his queen, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Amleth’s idyllic existence is highlighted by a peculiarly unique father-son bonding session involving a shaman-fool (Willem Dafoe), hallucinogens, and literal animalistic howling, which ends abruptly at the sharpened edge of Aurvandil’s half-brother’s (Claes Bang) weapon. Fjölnir takes Aurvandil’s kingdom, makes Gudrún his wife, and orders Amleth’s execution. Amleth escapes certain death but only after promising to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. It’s far easier vowed than done and a multi-decade interlude begins, where Amleth, now an outcast without title or property, grows up into a mega-brooding, hulking berserker (Alexander Skarsgård). Between the foundational trauma of losing everything at an early, impressionable age and the unbreakable vow he made then, Amleth’s future seems to involve Viking-era pillaging, plundering, and dying in combat (hello, Valhalla). That’s before, though, an unnamed seeress played by Björk in a remarkably memorable cameo, reminds Amleth of an immutable fate defined by the vow he made decades earlier. Where Shakespeare’s conscience-stricken Hamlet fatally hesitates in taking revenge against his brother-killing uncle and duplicitous mother, sealing his own fate, Eggers and Sjón leverage the idea of hesitation into a conflict between fate. Alongside that existential struggle comes Amleth’s long-buried desire for domesticity in the form of Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy). Olga is a Russian woman taken as a result of The Northman’s first extended set-piece, an elaborately choreographed, four-minute single take that pits Amleth and his fellow berserkers against a lightly defended Russian village. (Spoiler: The Russian village doesn’t stand a chance.) As bravura as anything in Eggers’s short, remarkable career, that first set-piece will linger in the audience’s minds as both mesmerizing and horrific. The filmmaker deliberately challenges the audience to continue their presumptive identification with Amleth and his quest. It’s a risk Eggers obviously considered and accepted when making The Northman, though it’s certainly likely to make some moviegoers or viewers hit the pause button and either bail or become apathetic toward Amleth’s blood- and gore-filled quest. They’ll still be pulled in by Eggers’ obsessive attention to period detail and visual style, but may keep Amleth and the characters in The Northman at arm’s length, their individual and collective fates more like pawns or minor pieces swept off a chessboard by a temperamental toddler. For those who aren’t alienated by the outcome of that first, brutal set-piece, Eggers’ exploration of Amleth’s monomaniacal journey suggests an inherent, if not necessarily original, critique of revenge narratives (i.e., who becomes the point of identification and why). And for Amleth, whose life has been defined by an intractable, inescapable vow (fate less as a mystical or supernatural form than a social, cultural, and political one), that journey comes full circle back to the foundational, life-altering experience watching his uncle commit regicide. It’s a toxic, ultimately destructive form of masculinity that leads in only one direction at the metaphorical, if not literal, gates of hell. Even as Olga, a pagan witch of sorts, offers another option (i.e., domesticity), Amleth can only see the vow he must fulfill and the fate he must embrace. That Amleth can’t bring himself to see any alternatives becomes, like Hamlet’s well-documented hesitation, his fatal flaw. While it’s impossible to separate his narrative from his visual style, Eggers continues his seemingly meteoric ascent to world-class filmmaker status, expanding his toolkit to encompass a breathtakingly intense, attention-grabbing, single-take approach to scene and story creation unlike anything else. It’s an approach that can be expensive (a reported $90M budget for a superhero- and spandex-free film) and demands next-level commitment from his collaborators on either side of the camera, including cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, editor Louise Ford, production designer Craig Lathrop, and costume designer Linda Muir, all of whom worked on Eggers first and second feature-length films. All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men.

"May 16, 2022",positive," Raise your alehorn and sword for mighty Robert Eggers, a true visionary, for he is the helmsman of The Northman (now on Prime Video), The Lighthouse and The Witch (or The VVitch if you please), a most awesomely unholy celluloid triumvirate. His latest is a Viking revenge saga promising enough barbarity and attention to authentic period minutiae to render one slackjaw with awe. Alexander Skarsgard and his pitiless trapezius muscles take center screen as a berserker questing to slake his thirst for vengeance, and his journey brings him in contact with fellow medieval nutjobs played by Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe and, lured back into film by forces surely beyond our comprehension, the sovereign goddess Bjork. I’m under the impression that if one doesn’t watch The Northman one risks being slaughtered for one’s great weakness, so here goes.  The Gist: The Northman opens as every movie should, with a direful prayer to a volcano. It’s A.D. 895, a time apparently void of rational thought. Odin has brought King Aurvandill War-Raven (Hawke) home from battle to his wife Queen Gudrun (Kidman) and tween son Amleth (Oscar Novak). Aurvandill hugs the living shit out of his boy; it’s a man’s man’s man’s man’s man’s world. His subjects pose in firelight as if they exist in ancient paintings. He eyes his plunder. Chained female slaves parade solemnly nearby. Gudrun suggests they head to the bedchamber, but there’s no time for that – Aurvandill sports a torso gash that nearly rendered him paté for vultures. It’s time to initiate his successor to the Tree of Kings, which requires him to bring Amleth to Heimir the Fool and Also the Mystical Dealer of Scandinavian Psychedelics, who will have them bark and howl and run about on all fours like wolves and lap up the drugs and belch and fart and levitate in front of surreal visions and take a pledge of vengeance when fathers are killed in glory in battle and now Amleth is a man. Amleth has barely coming-of-age’d when Aurvandill is betray’d by his own brother. The boy watches as Fjolnir (Claes Bang) commits regicide and sends his men to commit nepoticide, but when Amleth escapes, he vows to commit avunculicide because one doesn’t take a stoned lupine-oath without being fully dedicated to it. YEARS LATER. Amleth is now played by Skarsgard and has oarboated his traps unto godliness. All the better to help one achieve fireside reverie in praise of battle, and then run fearlessly into such, putting an ax into lesser men until their blood runs down one’s chiseled f—ing delts, lats and abs – and one red droplet down his cheek like a tear. It’s a living. He visits the Temple of Bjork and she reminds him of his oath, and then a RAVEN alights and LOOKS him in THE EYE. He quits the Viking gig and cuts off his hair and brands himself like a slave and passes himself as such on a boat headed to Fjolnir’s sheep farm in Iceland. Fjolnir is no longer king but that doesn’t mean he deserves to still have his head attached to his body. That’s just logic. Over stormy seas the slavers doth sail, and Amleth meets fellow prisoner Olga of the Birch Forest (Taylor-Joy), who utters spells in foreign tongues. He shares his story and they do what everyone does on first dates in romantic comedies, they vow to help each other kill people. He can break men’s bones, she says, “but I have the cunning to break their minds.” This is love if I’ve ever seen it. They’re assimilated into Fjolnir’s enslavement ranks. Amleth looks up and sees his mother shooing ravens from her window. She is now Fjolnir’s wife and they have a young son and he has another son from a previous relationship who’s a sad, sorry weakling. Fate tugs at Amleth: He follows the fox to get to the He-witch, he consults the He-witch to get the rope, he uses the rope to get to the zombie, he vanquishes the zombie to get the sword and he’ll use the sword to get his revenge, which wiggled and jiggled and tickled inside him – but to what end? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: The Northman is sort of Mel Gibson’s The Green Knight. It recalls Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ and Braveheart in its gruesome old-world bloodletting, and shares kinship with the likes of Gladiator and 300. Performance Worth Watching: Kidman acts up a storm in a key scene that cracks this plot wide open, and proves that sanity is a seed that finds no purchase in this world. Memorable Dialogue: I’m pretty sure Amleth’s mantra, “I will avenge you Father, I will save you Mother, I will kill you Fjolnir” is the “My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die” for a new generation. I also feel Fjolnir’s pain when he declares, “This is not the work of my god. This is truly sorcery!” because I say the exact same thing when the Detroit Lions lose. Sex and Skin: Vaguely shadowy frontal nudeness by fire- and lava-light; exposed hindquarters when Amleth and Olga make love on the forest floor within a shaft of moonlight, surely dirty-talking about slaying thine enemies and such. Our Take: The Northman is lunacy delivered with dead sincerity, and you’ll either roll your eyes and be repulsed, or leap headlong into the flaming crazy and revel in it. The latter reaction is far more tempting for those of us familiar with Eggers’ immersive, unapologetically weird, unsettling visual style, rife with long, virtuoso shots; his occultic-spiritual nightmare stories; and his insistence upon authenticity, which borders on obsessive and dares us to find an anachronism. This Viking tale – co-written by Eggers and Icelandic poet-artist Sjon, and derived from the Saxo Grammaticus-penned legend that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet – is one damn thing after another, rotating among scenes of grotesque violence, whispered declarations and pagan rituals ranging from randy courtship dances to human sacrifice, because in this culture, putting people into this world is just as maniacally fun as taking them out of it. So what we have here is a revenge picture enriched by eye-widening things: surreal iconography, liturgical deliria, soothsayer Bjork, an old desiccated severed head whose incredibly distinctive bone structure is clearly that of Willem Dafoe – things we haven’t seen before. And that experience is such a rarity, something to be treasured. Eggers looks upon the not-tortured-enough morality of this strange world with an unjudging eye; it’s a kill-or-be-enslaved existence ruled by the most putridly toxic masculinity, the type that inspires a man to utter I WILL BECOME A HAILSTORM OF IRON AND STEEL as he plots to torture those who committed the gravest of betrayals against him. Discomfort may very well be Eggers’ intent, whether it’s the perverted joy we don’t want to admit we feel when Amleth, schooled in the cruel domination of those weaker than him, inflicts violence upon his foes; or the whiplash guilt we experience when we realize how not fun it would be to watch a movie about a Viking learning to turn the other cheek. This is, after all, not a Christian society – “Their god is a corpse nailed to a tree!” declares a Viking man known as Finnr The Nose-Stub, because his proboscis was sliced off and left for the squirrels. The Northman is perhaps a statement on the folly of revenge and, for that matter, that of fate itself, since the people of ca. 1000 A.D. likely could not fathom the concept of free will. Eggers’ more pointed goal may be simply to adhere unyieldingly and unapologetically to that worldview, so deranged, strange and fascinating to our modern eyes. Our Call: STREAM IT. The Northman marries the battle epic with the chimerical vision of a director who’s one of the best in today’s game. It’s weird and it’s wondrous."
"May 15, 2022",positive," Fans of director Robert Eggers will not be disappointed in his latest film “The Northman,” an epic Viking revenge saga that stays true to his vision and style. This extremely violent, bloody, and gory film is gorgeously crafted, the performances are masterful, and the care taken to make it as historically accurate as possible is something to be commended. Twenty years later, an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has become a warrior Viking, tearing through villages on a fighting and murdering rampage. When he learns where his mother and uncle are living, the man disguises himself as a slave and goes to work on their farm. There he meets the ethereal witch Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave who also possesses magical powers. After suffering for years, Amleth finally gets revenge on those who wronged him so long ago. Brutality rages in this film, and it’s not for weak stomachs. Blood, guts, and beheadings continue throughout. This is one of the most intensely violent films I have ever seen, and at times it’s a challenge to watch. Eggers seamlessly incorporates aspects of Viking mythology, from their spiritual beliefs to historical customs. Mysticism and fantasy in the form of valkyries and witches exist in his story, as does the savagery of their way of life in 10th century Iceland. It’s evident that the filmmaking team took their time doing exhaustive research on what it was like at the time in order to make the film as historically accurate as possible. For that reason, it feels like being transported back to the dark, barbaric past. The film gives a real sense of what it must have been like to be alive during that time. The attention to detail is incredibly precise, and the costumes and makeup are jaw-dropping. The performances are phenomenal across the board, from Skarsgård’s primal fury to Kidman’s wicked-tongued mother, there isn’t a dud here. The casting is excellent, and everyone fits their part. The film dives into strange and artsy territory, which may try the patience of viewers expecting no-holds-barred historical action. There are plenty of exciting scenes of bloodthirsty battles, but the script has some unexpectedly thoughtful moments as well. Thank you very much for this encouraging review. I was betwixt and between re watching the film having been a regular viewer of ‘Vikings’. I decided against seeing it and watched my usual fare instead, though I’ll definitely watch when it comes up for hire.
I had the feeling it may have been ‘in the style’ of ‘The Revenant’ which I did not like, due to my reservations with this. Well, it is very much like “The Revenant,” and it is SUPER violent and gory. That was difficult to sit through, but the historical accuracy of the costumes, rituals, etc. is something pretty special.

"May 15, 2022",positive,"With its naked sword fight on top of an exploding volcano, The Northman is rad...its blood-soaked tale of vengeance right in line with the great Icelandic sagas, an epic cinematic rendering of a story that has been told for at least a thousand years"
"May 15, 2022",negative,"Visually it is darkly stunning, but storywise it is all over the place. Nicole Kidman is one film and Alexander Sharsgard is in another. Anna Taylor-Joy doesn't know where the heck she's supposed to be.

"May 14, 2022",positive,Eggers' film didn't resonate with me after I left the theater. I never felt pulled into the orbit of Amleth's revenge close enough to really empathize with his plight. Gorgeously shot yet oddly hollow emotionally. 
"May 14, 2022",negative," I wanted to love Robert Eggers’s follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse, but maybe a big-budget Viking saga just isn’t the right fit for a wonderful weirdo like him? I was so looking forward to The Northman, I’m bewildered to report that it didn’t dazzle me, that I gazed on this Viking epic largely unmoved. A serious disappointment. And I like Viking movies. If I can get decent longboats, berserker fights, vengeful slaves, axe-throwing, and the chilling moan of those crazy goat horns, I don’t even mind if stuff gets a little cheesy. Bonus points for Ernest Borgnine in The Vikings (1958) yelling “Odin!” as he leaps into a pit of ravenous wolves, sword in hand. Backed by Universal’s Focus Features, The Northman is Robert Eggers’ first launch into studio filmmaking and mainstream Hollywood, with the director’s previous projects, The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), making waves on a much smaller scale as indie horrors. Unfortunately, The Northman’s opening weekend was a box office bomb, bringing in only $12 million domestically — $23 million in total globally — against Eggers’ quoted $70-90 million budget. The Northman is about a glowering, muscle-bound man-mountain named Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, son of Stellan) who as a boy witnesses the killing of his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), and the abduction of his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), by the king’s betraying half-bastard brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth vows revenge. If that sounds vaguely like Hamlet, it’s by design. It seems Shakespeare adapted his play from old Norse sagas, and director Robert Eggers is a stickler for them and Norse history in general, hiring scholars to fact-check him throughout the development process. But first Amleth has to escape, grow up, and channel his hate, “which runs like a freezing river through my veins,” into the berserker lifestyle. Finally, he resumes his quest for revenge, disguising himself as a slave so he can be shipped off with the others to the Iceland settlement run by King Fjölnir, who by now has already lost the kingdom he usurped in Norway. For the first time in an Eggers film, the casting is a distracting problem. In The Witch, the luminous Anya Taylor-Joy in her star-making debut led an inspired ensemble, and in The Lighthouse, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe gave performances of awe-inspiring conviction in impossibly demanding roles. But in The Northman, dull brooder Skarsgård makes you realize how highly watchable Arnold Schwarzenegger was in Conan the Barbarian (1982), which just happens to be one of Eggers’s inspirations, along with Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev. Even more frustrating is the fact that frequently standing next to Skarsgård is a far more scintillating actor, Anya Taylor-Joy, who’s given very little to do as Olga, a witchy slave captured in the raid on the Land of Rus by the gang of Vikings that included Amleth. Once in Iceland, Amleth and Olga sneak off frequently behind hillocks to plan their slave revolt. Olga says darkly, “Your strength breaks men’s bones. I have the cunning to break their minds.” Which sounds pretty cool, but unfortunately you sit through the entire film waiting for her to do some mind-breaking, and she never does. She mixes up a batch of hallucinogenic soup at one point, but that’s the extent of it. There’s something so basically off about the whole project, I can only wonder: What happened to you, Robert Eggers? Cowriting with Sjón, an Icelandic poet and novelist, Eggers brings his usual obsession with historical accuracy to bear on the film, cross-checking his script and locations and costumes and props and everything else against what leading scholars say about the North Atlantic at the turn of the tenth century. Eggers’s obsession with minutia led to wild choices like Alexander Skarsgård wearing the same pair of boots throughout the entire shoot, repaired with strips of leather when they fell apart. We must laud these excesses, this fixation on weird-but-true history, because it thwarts the typical Disneyfication of older, stranger worlds that we tend to see in Hollywood. And this approach worked wonderfully in Eggers’s triumphant debut, The Witch, and in his even more daring follow-up film, The Lighthouse. But somehow here it’s run him aground. All through The Northman, it seems as if the Viking epic was directed by someone working in the style of Robert Eggers but without his ability to zero in on the specific shots and scenes to make a compelling vision of the past come alive. In The Witch, it’s those handheld shots from the back of the family wagon, roughly sharing the point of view of the children as their Puritan community’s big wooden gates shut on them, consigning them to their fates in the terrifying seventeenth-century wilderness. In The Lighthouse, it’s those first black-and-white shots (in a vintage, square-shaped aspect ratio) of that godforsaken rock off the coast of 1890s New England. The Northman has all the lavish resources studios can command, and it looks extraordinarily handsome throughout, shot by the same gifted cinematographer as Eggers’s previous films, Jarin Blaschke. It’s got gorgeous scenery, wonderful firelit interiors, cool beards and braids, nice fur wraps, and even Bjork in a small role as a scary seeress. But somehow those key shots that ignite the imagination and deliver you into the power of the narrative never appear. Frankly, I don’t think I will do it again. Even if it means, like, not making a film this big ever again. . . . And by the way, I’d like to make a film this big. I’d like to make one even bigger. But without control, I don’t know. It’s too hard on my person. But he’s also walked back those earlier remarks, insisting that the film represents no loss of authorship and that the studio’s role through postproduction was necessary to achieve the best version of The Northman. Still, it seems clear that he’s ambiguous at best about the process of making big-budget mainstream movies that almost inevitably involve a lot of interference from studio brass. If you read about Eggers’s childhood as a wunderkind encouraged at every turn by intellectual and creative adults to fulfill his potential, it seems he’s had such a rarefied experience overall, it’s made him unlikely to thrive in the meat-grinder system of the mainstream film industry. As Eggers put it himself, when asked why he thought test-screening audiences were having trouble with earlier cuts of The Northman, he said, “Currently, with my best intentions, like, I’m not normal. I look like a poster boy for a Bushwick hipster, but that is where my relatability ends, I fear.” It’s that “I fear” at the end of the sentence that marks Eggers as a reader, a dreamer, one of those obsessive kids who lives in their heads full of art and history and fantasy and as a result talks in unusual phraseology even into adulthood. (Guess how I know!) Eggers admits he was initially indifferent to Norse sagas, which were “too macho for my sensibilities.” It was his wife, clinical psychologist Alexandra Shaker, who inspired him with her love of all that blood-spewing, bonebreaking, honor-killing folklore. And it could be that it’s just not an ideal meeting of writer-director and subject matter. The film’s an honorable failure, in my view, but I also feel a certain urgency in saying that the sooner Robert Eggers goes back to his previous independent mode of filmmaking on subjects that obsess him personally from the start, the better."
"May 13, 2022",positive," Es un hecho que la industria en Hollywood está cambiando. El que una película como El Hombre del Norte llegue a las salas de cine, con ese reparto, esa manufactura y esa profundidad en su narrativa, es prácticamente producto de una alineación astral vikinga. Robert Eggers forma parte de una generación de directores de género estadounidenses que han demostrado que una nueva narrativa no es ajena al público masivo. Jordan Peele, de la mano de Universal, y Ari Aster, con A24, se han encargado de revitalizar el cine de Estados Unidos al seguir apostando por la experiencia teatral. En el caso de la tercera película de Eggers, El Hombre del Norte, ésta es un evento inmersivo desde sus primeros segundos. Una voz grave y la imagen de un volcán humeante son nuestro primer contacto con la historia trágica de venganza de Amleth. Dicho relato está basado, en cierta medida, en la saga escrita por el historiador medieval danés Saxo Grammaticus en su Gesta Danorum. Estos eventos ocurren en poco más de 20 minutos de iniciada la película, pero Eggers se encarga de presentarnos toda una forma de vida vikinga. Incluso se da el lujo de proyectar un ritual en el que Amleth debe dejar la niñez para convertirse en un hombre con la ayuda de su padre (Ethan Hawke) y Heimir el Tonto (Willem Dafoe). Ya en su etapa adulta, el camino de Amleth (Alexander Skärsgard) naturalmente va a recordar elementos de historias de venganza. Pero prácticamente estamos ante uno de los primeros relatos sobre el camino del héroe hacia su destino, su vendetta. Desde el ya mencionado Hamlet hasta El conde de Monte Cristo, la venganza ha jugado un papel importante en las historias clásicas sobre la redención y la justicia. Para Eggers esto es importante con un personaje que prácticamente debe dejar a un lado su comportamiento animal más básico. Incluso así lo conocemos como un Berserker, guerrero que pelea semidesnudo sólo con pieles de animales. Simplemente tiene que esperar al momento exacto para cobrar venganza y cumplir esa promesa que le hizo a su padre, a su madre y hasta el criminal de su tío. Es entonces donde la línea entre cine de autor y producción de estudio se mezcla, mostrando un resultado como pocas veces vemos en pantalla. En la década de los 60 era común ver en Hollywood superproducciones épicas como Cleopatra o Ben-Hur. A finales de los 90 e inicios del Siglo XXI regresó el género épico brevemente con Corazón valiente y Gladiador, cintas épicas donde precisamente la venganza y justicia juegan un papel importante. Naturalmente todo eso cambia con dos eventos que han modificado el panorama. Las franquicias son las que mandan, con presupuestos grandes o pequeños, pero siempre favoreciendo a los títulos conocidos. Y, por otro lado, el streaming ya ha seducido a más público. Es por ello que algo como El Hombre del Norte es sumamente raro, por no decir único, de ver en pantalla. La visión de un director como Eggers, con una fijación por la historia y los detalles. Y, por otro lado, que una película de ese presupuesto y tamaño se haya producido. El Amleth de Skärsgard desde que lo vemos de niño es noble y bondadoso, es testigo de una muerte que a cualquiera lo dejaría mal psicológicamente (de hecho en la historia escrita por Grammaticus, Amleth finge demencia y así logra estar cerca de su tío para planear su venganza) pero que incluso con todo ese dolor, aún existe humanidad en él. Al igual que Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy),  quien sufre de los estragos de la sociedad vikinga, eso no la deshumaniza ni la convierte en una dama en desgracia, su personaje da pelea y busca tan sólo un lugar en el mundo. Y aunque la historia pueda ser por muchos conocida, Eggers y Sjón logran una dinámica interesante a lo largo de sus actos. Con el ritmo necesario en cada uno de ellos y con algunos giros de tuerca que algunos ya verán venir, la experiencia cinematográfica no disminuye. Al contrario, una vez presentado el verdadero rostro del destino de Amleth, no hay vuelta atrás. La historia toma una dirección hacia la vorágine y acción dignas de cualquier venganza vikinga. En medio de un volcán en lava ardiente y un destino que cumplir. Debido a la crisis sanitaria por COVID-19, en Cine PREMIERE te recomendamos revisar con las autoridades de salud las medidas sanitarias necesarias (especialmente el Lineamiento general para la mitigación y prevención de COVID-19 en espacios públicos cerrados) antes de acudir al cine a ver una película.

"May 13, 2022",positive,"This is a movie that doesn't shy away from emotions, it embraces them fully. The actors don't shy away from overacting, either, they revel in it, and this is both refreshing and entertaining."
"May 12, 2022",positive," He may be known for the arthouse rather than the mainstream but writer/director Robert Eggers' action and ideas are never knowingly undersold. Tone is incredibly important to this Viking tale of revenge, which is so full-on it could easily tip into parody, and Eggers makes his attentions clear from the off with a spot of portentous voiceover and strong visuals - it feels Shakespearean, and so, perhaps, it should, given that its central figure Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) was also the inspiration for Hamlet. Eggers previously tackled American puritanism with The Witch and late 1800s superstition in The Lighthouse, taking an immersive approach to the belief systems in his films. You genuinely feel how much his characters have faith in their gods and their folk tales as an extension of their everyday lives, to the extent that the dividing line between what is real and what is imagined becomes almost nonexistent. His films also have an elemental feel, that's particularly in evidence here, with water present as icy snow and waves, while fire is represented both in ritual and by way of volcano. The story, co-written by Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón is as old as the volcano itself and sees young Amleth witness the death of his Viking king father (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his dad's brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Going on the run, he chants the mantra that basically drives the story: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Eggers' mantra is equally straightforward: ""Go big or go home"". Eggers' approach offers some glorious moments, including an atavistic coming-of-age ritual in which Ethan Hawke and his young co-star Oscar Novak (playing Amleth as a child) bring home the Viking connection to the natural world as they howl like wolves or a viking raid, shot in a long take that brings home its murderous menance. The problem with Eggers' love of a big mood is that, as with all his films, he operates at such a high level of intensity that he has barely anywhere else to go as the action progresses. I longed for some of the subtlety and allegorical underpinning of David Lowery's The Green Knight - hinted at in the film's more mystical moments. Anya Taylor-Joy (who got her break in The Witch) turns up as love interest Olga - not that Eggers has much time for such fripperies, a shame given the matriarchal structures of Icelandic society - while Bjork has an enjoyable cameo as the Viking equivalent of Macbeth's three witches, although I do have to question the casting of Nicole Kidman as Amleth's mother (she is only nine years older than Skarsgård and looks a lot less than). You can also feel the studio at work when it comes to the film's final act, or rather, acts, uncertain whether to offer happiness or tragedy it tries, not entirely successfully, to go for both in a bid to provide something for everyone. There's plenty of might about Eggers' films but I could use a bit more heart."
"May 11, 2022",positive,"The Northman is brutal, bloody and violent, even a little gory at times. But its beautiful aesthetics displayed in every shot and every sequence place it above other movies with similar topics. [REVIEW IN SPANISH]"
"May 11, 2022",positive," Tras La bruja (2015) y El faro (2019), ese director de culto y de moda que es el estadounidense Robert Eggers concibió la película más ambiciosa de su carrera con una épica de venganza inspirada en la mitología vikinga para la que contó con un elenco de lujo y con un generoso presupuesto de 90 millones de dólares. El resultado es imponente desde lo visual, pero no tanto en términos dramáticos."
"May 11, 2022",negative," Los vikingos han sido un fenómeno muy popular en nuestra cultura pop contemporánea durante la última década. Aunque ya existen grandes películas de vikingos como Los vikingos (1958), El guerrero número 13 (1999) y la injustamente fallida Valhalla Rising (2009), solo con la serie Vikings (2013 - 2021) se puede hablar de un verdadero hype, que también ha penetrado en el popular mundo del juego con Assassin's Creed Valhalla y God of War, entre otros. Ahora el director de cine estadounidense Robert Eggers también ha hecho uso de este tema. Este director es popular entre los cinéfilos y amantes del cine indie por sus anteriores películas La bruja (2015) y El faro (2019), en las que combina lo histórico con lo oculto de una forma cinematográficamente muy inusual. Para todas sus películas, Robert Eggers lleva a cabo una investigación histórica, lee en profundidad el tema y se deja asesorar por varios expertos. En este caso, entre otros, el reconocido arqueólogo Neil Price, especializado en vikingos y chamanismo. Y así, aunque The Northman es mucho más un thriller de venganza fuertemente mitológico que un recuento de la historia; es, con mucho, la película vikinga más realista en términos de historicidad, desde la ropa hasta la armadura y los ritos. Especialmente con esto último The Northman destaca, ya que otras películas y series nunca han profundizado tanto en la mitología nórdica y sus rituales. Desde el punto de vista de un historiador, lo único que se podría criticar es la falta general de color en la película, como ocurre con la mayoría de las historias ambientadas en la Edad Media. Pero esta frialdad es también el estilo del director, como en este caso. Se agradece que Robert Eggers no haya rodado esta película íntegramente en blanco y negro, como hizo con El faro. Pero hay una gran diferencia con sus dos películas anteriores: esta vez Robert Eggers no ha rodado para el estudio de cine independiente A24, sino para el mucho más grande Universal Pictures. Esto probablemente también le permitió conseguir un presupuesto de 90 millones de dólares, seis veces más de lo que costaron sus dos películas anteriores juntas. Ahora uno podría temer que Robert Eggers haya vendido su alma por el gran estudio cinematográfico, pero aquí podemos dar el visto bueno. Robert Eggers sigue siendo fiel a su estilo y The Northman lleva claramente su firma. Hasta qué punto el estudio ha interferido en sus libertades artísticas, por supuesto, es imposible de decir. En una entrevista, Robert Eggers afirma que sólo hubo compromisos de no mostrar los genitales masculinos para que la película también pudiera proyectarse en otros países como China. Audiovisualmente, se pueden ver y oír los altos costes de producción de la película. La fotografía, la música y el diseño de sonido son del más alto nivel, aunque no cabe esperar nada revolucionario. La película se rodó principalmente en Islandia, pero también en parte en Irlanda debido al coronavirus, con posterior postproducción digital. La trama se esboza rápidamente: en el año 895 d.C., el joven Amleth (interpretado posteriormente como adulto por Alexander Skarsgård) debe suceder a su padre, el rey vikingo Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), en el trono de un pequeño reino. Pero este rey es asesinado por su propio hermano Fjölnir (Claes Bang) para apoderarse de su trono y reino. El joven Amleth debe huir y busca venganza. La historia se basa en la antigua saga danesa de Amletus, que inspiró el Hamlet de William Shakespeare. Seguimos a Amleth, que busca la venganza, en su locura por la sangre, la suciedad y el barro durante más de dos horas. ""Ahora ves el mundo a través de los ojos de un hombre"" le había anunciado su padre a Amleth poco antes de su muerte. Esta cámara asume por completo el papel de sus ojos supuestamente masculinos. Sigue a nuestro personaje principal en todo momento y no permite ninguna distancia. Al igual que Amleth, la cámara se deja capturar completamente por el odio y el fanatismo. El gran problema aquí es que el motivo de la venganza no arrastra al espectador lo suficiente. Para mí, el punto llegó a los 20 minutos, cuando sólo pude seguir la loca sed de sangre de nuestro ´héroe` sin comprender y negando con la cabeza. Probablemente el propio Amleth no cree en su plan de venganza en todo momento. Tras un largo periodo de represión y olvido, primero tuvo que ser persuadido de nuevo por un Norne (una figura fatídica de la mitología nórdica) para llevar a cabo este plan asesino. Tendría una profecía que cumplir. Posteriormente, todas las atrocidades cometidas se justifican por esta profecía hilada por las Norns. Todo esto es extremadamente determinista y parece que no hay forma de salir de este ciclo de violencia y venganza para nadie. En ningún momento Amleth actúa aquí como una persona autónoma; siempre sigue siendo un hombre impulsado. Cuando las cosas no están claras, siempre recurre a las Norns y a las brujas para que le dicten el camino a seguir. El protagonista de la película está manipulado y no es el dueño de su propia historia, aunque la cámara nos lo haga creer. La imagen del héroe aquí es muy anterior a la Ilustración, una imagen realmente contundente y totalmente primitiva. Sin embargo, el elemento psicológico es el que marca el ritmo de la película cuando los límites de la locura se vuelven muy fluidos. En El Faro, esto seguía ocurriendo debido a las circunstancias, el aislamiento y el exceso de alcohol. En cambio, en The Northman, estas secuencias son una expresión de las convicciones de los personajes, especialmente en la conexión con lo mitológico. En el mundo de los vikingos, tal como lo muestra Eggers, la religión no es simplemente un aspecto parcial de la vida, sino que la impregna por completo. Una y otra vez vemos a Amleth o a otros perderse en visiones, mezclando los mundos físico y espiritual. Genial, por ejemplo, es una aparición desgraciadamente muy breve de la cantante de culto Björk como vidente que recuerda al protagonista su destino. La trama de venganza basada en la figura legendaria de Amletus es la parte más débil de la película. Eggers y su coguionista Sjón (Lamb), no consiguen distinguirse de forma significativa de las miles de historias de venganza con las que se inunda el mercado cinematográfico cada año y tampoco parece importarle, ni a sus personajes. Se pueden calificar benévolamente de clásicos. De forma menos benévola, son bastante aburridos y carecen de cualquier forma de caracterización digna de mención. Hay que reconocer que esto es bastante inusual en este tipo de obras históricas. La idea de una personalidad es un poco más reciente. Sin embargo, a veces es difícil mantener el interés por el destino de los personajes individuales. Hasta cierto punto, esto se compensa con el conjunto absurdamente destacado, que una y otra vez tiene momentos de brillantez. Especialmente queda en la memoria un monólogo de Nicole Kidman -que interpreta de forma un tanto irritante a la madre de Alexander Skarsgård después de que ambos aparecieran como matrimonio en Big Little Lies- en una escena clave en la que todo el marasmo se vuelca de nuevo ante el público. No es agradable, pero es aún más fascinante. Justo antes del final habría una oportunidad para que la película rompiera esta ley de violencia contundente y deconstruyera el motivo de la venganza y la masculinidad primitiva en los metros finales: habría una forma de que Amleth escapara de la locura, de que se liberara de la fatídica red de los Norns. Pero la película le prohíbe hacer esta elección. ""Sólo los tontos intentan escapar del destino"". Y como no se nos permite ser tontos, nosotros, como público, seguimos siendo testigos de la locura hasta el amargo y ardiente final. Además, la historia de amor, algo hilvanada aquí y allá, no le toca a uno en absoluto. No es muy creíble y esta película oscura y fría es incapaz de evocar verdaderas emociones. Dado que la violencia ha entrado en nuestro mundo real de la manera más brutal, no podemos evitar ver esta película bajo la influencia de la situación política mundial actual. La lección que debemos aprender de la película: no nos dejemos guiar por un supuesto destino predeterminado, aunque la situación parezca no tener camino ni alternativa. Sí, seamos tontos en la duda,rompamos la rueda de la violencia y la venganza en cuanto haya la más mínima posibilidad de hacerlo. Si no lo hacemos, sólo dejaremos atrás tierra quemada, como en las películas, y libraremos la batalla final a las puertas del infierno (nuclear), donde sólo puede haber perdedores. Debemos tener cuidado de no dejarnos embrujar por nuestras Norns actuales y embarcarnos en un camino brutal y sangriento en el que, a partir de cierto punto, ya no hay vuelta atrás. Porque ya no nos espera ninguna valquiria y las puertas del Valhalla, a diferencia de las del infierno, hace tiempo que se cerraron. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"May 11, 2022",positive," Su nueva película es épica, masiva y ostentosa, pero lo que ha perdido en intimidad y ambigüedad lo compensa con una dirección sublime y estilizada. El hombre del norte (The Northman, 2022) es una magnífica ópera visual. Su trama, un relato de venganza relativamente primitivo, no esconde grandes sorpresas. Pero hay una indudable cualidad hipnótica en la composición del film: es a la vez bello y horripilante, violento y esotérico, elevado por su cosmogonía y rebajado por el melodrama. Hay un balance delicadísimo de antinomias en juego y Eggers lo ejecuta con la destreza de un maestro de su propio arte. La película adapta la leyenda nórdica que inspiró el Hamlet de Shakespeare, acerca de un príncipe vikingo y su violenta venganza contra el asesino de su padre y captor de su madre. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), un guerrero dedicado a arrasar aldeas poseído por un frenesí sanguinario, es un héroe menos psicológicamente refinado que su contraparte teatral. No hay lugar para la duda o la introspección. La historia es sencilla porque la perspectiva del héroe es sencilla, simplificada por un juramento repetitivo y arengada por visiones fantásticas. Si hay un hilo conector entre las tres películas del director - que habita pasados históricos con la comodidad y verosimilitud de un viajero del tiempo - es este: sus personajes tienden a ofuscar su entendimiento del mundo (y de sí mismos) invocando supersticiones que los terminan destruyendo o trascendiendo, si es que pueden distinguir entre ambos. La bruja (The Witch, 2015) se sirve del folclore puritano para contar su historia de paranoia corruptora. El faro (The Lighthouse, 2019) cita a la mitología griega para contar una críptica fábula de anhelo y represión. Arraigada en un Medioevo brutal en el que una muerte cruel es parte de cualquier buen desayuno o deporte amistoso, El hombre del norte admite a la mitología nórdica en clave de visiones espectaculares, desde criaturas fantásticas hasta la mítica Valhalla y un gigantesco árbol genealógico, tan literal como abominable, similar al Yggdrasil. Todas vienen a justificar la violencia, en definitiva. El camino del héroe es glorificado a la vieja usanza de las sagas pero también es cuestionado, sino por el propio héroe, por quienes lo rodean. Aquí el impulso masculino es acomplejado por la intrusión del escrutinio femenino, en particular Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) y Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), quienes se guardan los mejores monólogos de la película. Hay ritos de sobra dentro de la trama, pero la propia película cobra una dimensión ritual al emular a través del simple accionar de los personajes el ritmo, el ánimo y la mentalidad de una época en particular (excursos mágicos inclusive). En manos de otro director ésta sería una película de venganza más, otro film de acción disfrazado de algo que no es. Robert Eggers y su equipo capturan un mito y lo elevan como sólo podría haberlo hecho el cine."
"May 8, 2022",positive," There’s a poetry to Robert Eggers’ language. As a storyteller, his incredibly detailed world has a gravitational pull toward excellence. It comes through in his dialogue, camera framing and immersive production design. And although his latest, The Northman, is a classic tale as old as time, Eggers bakes a brutal cake layered with meaning, incredibly rewarding themes, and a grand sense of mystery. Like Eggers’ previous work (The Witch and The Lighthouse), The Northman is wicked and delightfully weird without ever losing its grip on being a compelling character study engulfed in dazzling imagery – and it’s his best film to date. The Focus Features’ Viking epic follows Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) on the verge of becoming a man when his father (Ethan Hawke) is ferociously murdered by his uncle (a terrific Claes Bang of The Square). Amleth’s uncle kidnaps Prince Amleth’s mother (an award-worthy Nicole Kidman), leaving his world upside down as he tries to find his place in it. Raised with tremendous hate in his heart for the next 20 years, Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is ready to exact revenge and take back what’s been stolen from him. Compared to Eggers’ previous two films, The Northman is his most straightforward narrative. However, that doesn’t hinder the experience one bit. Eggers' films are mesmerizing because of the haunting and psychedelic imagery and detail. The Witch and The Lighthouse both feature images that will continue to live on, and The Northman is no different.  There’s a scene involving children that will stick and really upset some people. It’s incredibly dark and brutal, but it raises interesting questions about where the line is for Amleth? He is someone so consumed with hate that he’s strategic about everything, making the basic need to be human feel nonexistent. This is perfectly visualized in a scene where he cries his last tear as a child. And what kind of Eggers movie would this be if it didn’t dip into the supernatural? This is an arena that Eggers excels in as a filmmaker. Anything that feels otherworldly is always grounded because of his navigational skills with tone. He can show you the most disturbing material and still have you eager to see where the story goes.  One terrific duel between Amleth and a giant, undead entity will excite those who have a taste for the weird. But the sequence also pumps the brakes with its follow-through. All these larger-than-life experiences have a reason for going to the extreme. For instance, the fight scene mentioned above could be read as an internal battle to prove Amleth’s worthiness in receiving heroic gifts (like a sword). Eggers is cautious about blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.  Performance-wise, so much can be said about Skarsgård’s beastly take. Not only does he tap into the complex emotions of a man trying to fulfill a promise and have a legacy of his own, but he also brings so much physically to the role that’s intoxicating. One scene when he catches a spear and throws it right back to its sender is chilling. How Skarsgård walks (in a slow, deliberate, and blood-thirsty manner) is something that deserves to be decorated in gold. You’ll believe Amleth’s pain 100 percent. But it is Kidman who gives the most surprising turn of the film. It’s been some time since she’s gone to this level. She accomplishes so much in such little screen time, primarily in a scene near the film’s last third, which is one of the most powerfully constructed and acted moments in any movie ever. You’ll know it when you see it because you’ll feel a fire build within you.  The Northman may not pull everyone in at once, but it will have some serious legs. More and more people will discover it over time, and those who do will sing its praises far and wide. It’s an old story, older than Hamlet. (Hamlet, with his similar sounding name, is actually based on Amleth’s journey.) But there’s such a freshness to its view on fatherhood and what we lose along the way. There’s also a lot to admire and learn, like how the younger generation sees the older generation as having more integrity for having faced a harder world.  From visionary director Robert Eggers comes THE NORTHMAN, an action-filled epic that follows a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father’s murder. With an all-star cast that includes Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, and Willem Dafoe.

"May 6, 2022",negative," Directed by Robert Eggers, The Northman follows Viking-era warrior Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) as he sets out to avenge the brutal murder of his father (Ethan Hawke’s Aurvandill) at the hands of his own brother (Claes Bang’s Fjölnir). Filmmaker Eggers, working from a screenplay written with Sjón, delivers an often astonishingly impenetrable endeavor that contains few, if any, elements designed to capture and sustain the viewer’s attention, and there’s little doubt, ultimately, that the arms-length atmosphere is compounded (and then some) by an ongoing emphasis on frustratingly (and palpably) indecipherable dialogue – as Eggers has seemingly directed his talented roster of heavily-accented performers to mumble and whisper their way through the picture’s entire, interminable runtime. It is, as a result, not surprising to note that The Northman suffers from a pervasive lack of context that grows increasingly problematic/disastrous as it progresses, with Eggers’ frequent reliance on head-scratching asides and digressions, including a series of laughably pretentious dream sequences, certainly going a long way towards perpetuating the nigh endless vibe. And although Eggers has admittedly peppered the proceedings with a very small handful of engaging interludes (eg Amleth violently storms a small village alongside other Vikings), The Northman builds towards a completely (and hopelessly) underwhelming climax that ensures it concludes on as lackluster a note as one could’ve envisioned – with the end result an epically-misguided trainwreck that couldn’t possibly be less interesting or involving."
"May 6, 2022",positive," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Robert Eggers es uno de los cineastas más interesantes de los últimos años —un director que no está en lo absoluto interesado en contar historias que se lleven a cabo en la actualidad, más bien enfocándose en el pasado y en personajes y lugares muy específicos. “La bruja”, su primer largometraje, es un excelente filme de terror con una precisión histórica envidiable, y “El faro” se siente como algo extraído directamente de los diarios de marinos y cuidadores de faros del siglo pasado. Para “El hombre del norte” (The Northman), sin embargo, ha regresado incluso más atrás en el tiempo, a la época de los vikingos, inspirándose en el mito que inspiró a William Shakespeare para crear “Hamlet”. Considerando la filmografía y estilo de Eggers, entonces, no debería sorprender que “El hombre del norte” se desmarque de cualquier otra película de vikingos. Ciñéndose, como siempre, a la precisión histórica, pero mezclando lo realista con lo fantástico —especialmente durante secuencias de alucinaciones y sueños—, lo que ha hecho Eggers con esta película es desarrollar una intensa historia de venganza, sin ocultar lo barbárica y sangrienta y brutal que era la vida en aquella época para estas personas. Es por eso que, a pesar de contar con un mayor presupuesto y con más actores que en sus dos películas anteriores, “El hombre del norte” no se siente como un blockbuster tradicional. Se trata, de hecho, de una película de Eggers al 100%, lo cual, desgraciadamente, podría terminar por alienar a aquellos que esperen ver algo más del mainstream. “El hombre del norte” comienza de manera similar a “Hamlet”, pero felizmente se va diferenciando cada vez más de la obra de Shakespeare mientras va avanzando. En el prólogo, vemos a un joven príncipe Amleth viviendo en relativa paz en su pueblo, con su madre, la Reina Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), y cuando regresa de sus aventuras, también con su padre, el despiadado Rey Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Desgraciadamente, su tío, Fjolnir (Claes Bang; ¡gran nombre!) quiere usurpar el trono, por lo que asesina al rey, dejando al chico por muerto. Años después, un Amleth ya adulto (Alexander Skarsgård) ha encontrado a una nueva familia, dedicándose a la violencia y las redadas. No obstante, no ha olvidado la promesa de venganza que se hizo a sí mismo: rescatar a su madre, vengar a su padre, y matar a Fjolnir. Y cuando se le presenta la oportunidad, logra viajar a Islandia, haciéndose pasar por esclavo, para trabajar en la granja de su tío. Es ahí donde conoce a Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), de quien se enamora, y quien lo ayuda a planear el asesinato de su nuevo jefe, para que luego puedan escapar libres y, con algo de suerte, acompañados de Gudrún, quien felizmente sigue viva. Estilísticamente hablando, “El hombre del norte” es una película que trata de recrear la vida y sociedad de los vikingos de la manera más realista y cercana posible. Las locaciones —incluyendo a la impresionante Islandia— contribuyen a que el espectador se transporte a esta época en el pasado, y todo aspecto artístico y estilístico, desde el vestuario hasta el diseño de producción, está lleno de detalles que ayudan tanto a la caracterización de los personajes, como a la narración de la historia. “El hombre del norte” es una película sucia, sangrienta, en donde uno hasta puede oler a los personajes, siempre cubiertos de barro, tierra y tripas. Esto contrasta perfectamente con algunos planos francamente bellos; la suciedad de este mundo y las imágenes impactantes que Eggers y su equipo logran diseñar se complementan de manera inesperadamente efectiva. Esta interpretación verosímil de los vikingos también se ve reflejada en el trabajo de personajes. “El hombre del norte” es una historia interesante porque no está poblada por héroes y villanos; la moralidad de los personajes es relativa, y nada es presentado en blanco y negro. Amleth es nuestro protagonista únicamente porque no es tan salvaje como sus enemigos, pero eso no quiere decir que sea una figura heroica. Igual es capaz de asesinar despiadadamente, y está tan enfocado en la venganza, en el odio, que muchas veces comete errores o toma decisiones que podrían costarle la felicidad o, al menos, la tranquilidad. Una escena en particular, en donde su madre la revela una verdad inesperada, sirve para esclarecer las diferentes perspectivas que estos personajes pueden tener de los mismos eventos, y para terminar por confirmar que nadie en esta película es totalmente bueno o totalmente malo. De hecho, a nivel narrativo, dicha escena sirve para introducir el mejor giro con el que cuenta “El hombre del norte”. Porque fuera de eso, no se trata de una experiencia particularmente compleja a nivel de historia. La premisa es algo que ya se ha visto antes, pero lo que importa acá, más que el “qué”, es el “cómo”. La mezcla de precisión histórica con secuencias visualmente impresionantes —muchas de ellas relacionadas a los sueños y visiones que tiene Amleth— logran otorgarle una identidad muy propia a la cinta, y aunque “El hombre del norte” no se podría describir como una experiencia tradicionalmente divertida, es muy posible que los deje impactados, tanto por lo brutal que puede llegar a ser, como por su conclusión emocionalmente agridulce. Alexander Skarsgård —más musculoso que nunca— está muy bien como Amleth, interpretándolo (especialmente al inicio) como una bestia en cuerpo de hombre, caminando de manera jorobada, matando sin piedad, casi como una máquina. No obstante, resulta interesante ver cómo, hasta cierto punto, se va humanizando y suavizando, pero sin perder de vista su objetivo principal. Anya Taylor-Joy, por su parte, no da una mala actuación, pero a diferencia del resto del reparto, tiene problemas con el acento que intenta darle a su personaje. Claes Bang trata de ir más allá de los clichés con Fjolnir, y a pesar de que no tiene demasiado qué hacer, Nicole Kidman resalta como la Reina Gudrún, especialmente en un par de escenas particularmente intensas. Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, y hasta Björk (como una bruja, porque obviamente) tienen roles pequeños pero importantes. “El hombre del norte” es el tipo de película que ya no vemos con demasiada frecuencia en el cine —un filme que no pertenece a ninguna franquicia ni tiene como protagonistas a superhéroes, y que sin embargo cuenta con un presupuesto relativamente alto, como para cumplir sin problemas con las exigencias del guion. Adicionalmente, es una película para mayores; no es gratuitamente violenta o sexual, pero sí cuenta con momentos sangrientos y con algo de gore, así como escenas breves de desnudos que, felizmente, no abusan del male gaze. Por ende, no me sorprende que no le esté yendo tan bien en la taquilla; es una experiencia difícil de vender, pero si se animan a darle una oportunidad, estoy seguro que saldrán de la sala de cine igual de impactados que este servidor. “El hombre del norte” es, pues, de lo más memorable que podrían ver este año, y una experiencia que vale la pena tener frente a una pantalla grande."
"May 5, 2022",positive,"The Northman falls short of being an epic film, but the mastery in composition of the film is noteworthy."
"May 5, 2022",positive,"Execution, performance, and art direction are all unparalleled, but the whole simply proves a solid familial melodrama in the end. They can’t all be ""great."""
"May 5, 2022",positive," Those familiar with HAMLET will find some familiar things in Robert Eggers’ THE NORTHMAN, and that is no coincidence. The source material for both is Sjón’s Gesta Danorum (circa 1200) about a prince with both mommy issues and a usurping uncle. Where Shakespeare adapted the story to his time creating an elegantly and eloquently melancholy protagonist, Eggers has embraced the wildness of the original, creating a world of primal ritual where the spirit realm regularly interacts with the material one, and life is nasty, brutish, and short. Mercifully so, if we can take the word of Amleth’s father, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), whose fondest hope is to die in battle rather than be disgraced by lingering into decrepit old age. It does give a whole new cast to the ending, and if only for that, Eggers is to be highly commended. This Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), more direct in his speech and far less elegant by modern standard, is the beloved son of Aurvandil and Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). On the last sunny day of his childhood, his father newly returned from battle with the spoils of same, takes young Amleth to an overnight, underground ritual that will mark him as his heir and usher him into manhood. The mind-altering substance involved along with the burps and farts that separate humans from the beasts, affords fantastic visions (the first of many in a film dense with symbolism and savagery), and bonds father and son so tightly that when brother and Uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) sets upon them as they leave the ritual caverns, it commits Amleth to a life pledged to avenging his father, saving his mother from the rapacious Fjölnir, and killing said rapacious Fjölnir. It is the invective the young prince spews as a mantra as he rows away from certain death into the Land of the Rus. Years pass, and the young man, now grown to ferocious manhood as a warrior pillaging the countryside, learns the fate of his treacherous uncle. He summarily decides to pass himself off as a slave in order to infiltrate the king’s exile settlement in Iceland, and take his revenge. He meets the sly and subte Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave who isn’t fooled by his disguise, but who is taken with his plans and offers to break minds the way Amleth plans on breaking bones. Eggers spares us little of what made Northmen (aka Vikings) so feared. The scenes of just how the Rus decimate a peaceful village without mercy or even much thought as to the humanity of their victims, is the stuff of nightmares. This Amleth is no scholar home from university dithering about what to do. This is a killing machine whipped into a Berserker. Skarsgård embodies the physicality effortlessly and imbues this tortured soul with an equally tortured emotional state. He simmers with rage while mouthing humility to his new masters, and evokes the psychic scars of remorse when seeing his mother again for the first time since the fratricide. There is also a complexity to his relationship with Olga, at first latching on to her only as an instrument of revenge, and then slipping into an attachment without sentiment, yet with a similarly seething passion. This is a character of his time and place, certainly made unsympathetic to us by his actions. Yet Skarsgård, while never mitigating Amleth’s warrior code, still makes of Amleth a sympathetic character, capable of invoking our sympathy by keying into the part of Amleth that is resonant in his plight. It’s a subtle performance in a film that is ferocious, and all the more effective for it. The spirit world and the material world share the same psychic space here, such that no raven is merely a bird, and a Valkyrie with graven teeth flying Amleth through the air to meet his fate is no more unusual than a seagull floating over the landscape. In a place where dismembered corpses provokes no horror beyond the disrespect inflicted on one’s honor, and where human sacrifice is little more noteworthy than any other kind, the spirit world’s hold is not only credible, but a necessary component in the context that Eggers provides. The mystical is an explanation and a release, not unlike the orgiastic rituals and the proto-cricket played with extreme prejudice. When death is merely a transition from one reality to another, the fleeting nature of life is a given, and not something about which to fret. As in the case of Aurvandil, death, achieved honorably and in one’s prime, a gift. THE NORTHMAN is a dark tale told with precision and wonder. It is a brutal experience for the viewer, forceful and forthright in its vision, but it is an experience that is more than mere entertainment, because it does more than merely immerse us in an alien culture that is abhorrent by modern standards. It makes it sensible on many levels. We might never want to spend a day, or even an hour, in this place and this time, but there is something about the easy communion with the invisible world that is aspirational. Plus a hero every bit as complex as the one with which Shakespeare gifted us."
"May 4, 2022",positive," Director Robert Eggers has quickly made a name for himself in Hollywood thanks to his first two features, the somber yet entrancing horror films The Witch and The Lighthouse. But with his third feature, The Northman, Eggers has definitively proved that he’s a cinematic force to be reckoned with. The Northman is a revenge tale based loosely on a Viking legend, and it allows Eggers to lay bare his ambitious, sweeping vision with emphatic determination and well-earned confidence. The story itself is as predictable as most movies about retribution, but the fact that this movie is nonetheless bewitching despite its predictability is the most telling testament to Eggers’ unique and effective style of storytelling. Set mostly in a small kingdom off the coast of Ireland sometime in the 9th Century, The Northman opens as King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns to his wife, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), and their young son, Prince Amleth, who encounters bizarre beings such as a he-witch played by Willem Dafoe, and a Seeress (who may not even have eyes) played by Icelandic singer Björk. The King is soon struck down in his prime before his son’s very eyes, and though the boy runs away to spare himself the same fate, he eventually grows up to be a man hellbent on avenging his father’s murder. Played as an adult by Alexander Skarsgard in a career-best role, Amleth sets out to find the target of his vengeance — his own murderous uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Given the rather simple setup, it doesn’t take a Seeress to know what you can reasonably expect to occur over the next two hours. Amleth knows he is fated to die at the Gates of Hell, but not before he rescues his mother and kills his uncle. Anna Taylor Joy also shows up to lend the proceedings some additional intrigue as a mysterious sorceress peasant, but the role proves ultimately pointless, and The Northman proceeds almost exactly as you expect it to from start to finish. That said, Eggers and his co-writer, Icelandic poet Sjón, earn the film’s leisurely running time, as they make this familiar story utterly captivating. The point, clearly, is the journey, and not Amleth’s fateful destination. That trek is created by Eggers’ confident camera and Jarin Blaschke’s vigorous cinematography as well as Louise Ford’s seamless editing, and Sebastian Gainsborough’s heart-pounding score. Other talented veterans from Eggers’ first two films include Costume Designer Linda Muir and Production Designer Craig Lathrop. This gifted below-the-line group works in harmony together and the gorgeous final product reflects both their devotion to the project and their dedication to each other. Muir designs the Viking-style costumes you might expect, but she accentuates her characters with various flourishes such as headpieces and other bits of armor that denote a heightened sense of importance. Lathrop gives you fireplaces, sheds where a lot of scary and important things happen, a witch’s cavern, and a mighty volcano appropriately called Hel, while Ford takes you from fast-paced action to panoramic still shots of the incredible vistas that Blaschke captures. In the background, Gainsborough’s soundtrack insists that this story is epic and that more is at stake than simply “fate” or “honor.” After all, Prince Amleth is widely understood to be the inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet, so much is riding on his swole shoulders. Of course, this story would not be nearly as interesting were it not for the equally capable actors who help Eggers tell it. Skarsgard and Bang are two of Scandinavia’s best working thespians today, and what can one say of tireless Aussie Nicole Kidman? Though the amalgam of accents that these actors of different nationalities employ at times teeters dangerously close to House of Gucci territory, most of the action in Eggers’ screenplay is thankfully on the battlefield or in the shadows, and there is insufficient dialogue to grate the senses with a spoken mélange of tones. At the end of the day, these three actors, as well as Dafoe and Taylor-Joy, triumph with their expressions and visceral movements, and The Northman conveys the same grandiose consequentiality that any of Shakespeare’s royal tragedies do. Few will walk out of The Northman without taking something memorable with them. Though the inherent predictability of revenge movies, with their familiar themes of fate and destiny and excessive use of animal symbolism (in this case ravens and goats), can often result in a heavy-handed movie, that is fortunately not the case with Eggers’ third film. Thanks to Eggers’ confident manner of storytelling, one that permits his brilliant cast to meld seamlessly with the monumental efforts of numerous craftspeople, The Northman is one of the most impressive if not downright haunting movies to hit theaters in quite a while."
"May 4, 2022",positive," The environment of The Northman is one of ice and fire, one where it’s difficult to imagine anything beyond cloudy skies, dirt & mud, windy days, and volcanic nights. And such an environment, of course, breeds a kind of man who fights as if dominated and possessed by the elements. Knights of ice and fire, they could be. Director Robert Eggers, after his previous effort The Lighthouse, continues his exploratory thread of male gender politics and bonds, if by way of ripped abs and pure vengeance. No matter how potentially challenging, his movie is a revenge action picture first and foremost, crafted out of iron and sorcery, delivered to a moviegoing world that demands the familiar and the colorful. Revenge is familiar and colorful, but the landscape is cloudy and bleak, smothered in the smog of smoke. This is a film that gives what is wanted, without any regrets, through an environment that’s as angry as it is awesome. Nothing about The Northman is unattainable to standard observation. It’s all simple to gather if dressed up with the legend of spells and rituals. The young prince of a Viking kingdom goes on the run after witnessing the murder of his father and the kidnapping of his mother at the hands of his uncle, vowing to avenge his fallen family and to kill anyone and everyone in his way, living for nothing more. Growing up to become an ax-wielding pack of muscles in the form of Alexander Skarsgard, the prince covers his animalistic intent with the sheepskin veil of a mild-mannered slave in order to fulfill his fate and end his journey. A standard tale, but boldly told. Moviegoing with Bill is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts, get exclusives, join my Movie Club, and support my work, consider becoming a paid subscriber. Skarsgard plays this prince with a hulking presence, speaking as if to grunt and shout - at least at first. It’s celebratory how well he’s able to transition the character back into a human being and thinking individual after years and years as an instinctual beast. It’s through both his long-form hunt and his meeting with a young handmaiden slave, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The Northman bludgeons and brutalizes and casts much magic, but it’s in the performance of Joy, whose role is on a path towards freedom and life and genius, that a kind of grace is found. No duh, but absolutely fine as is. Joy shines with intensity when calm and control when intense. She’s come so far from her revelatory turn in Eggers’s The Witch, pushing herself further and further, if in baby steps. Slow and steady. It would be a shame to write about the acting in this film without mentioning its best-performed sequence, between Skarsgard and Nicole Kidman. There’s a spectrum between Joy and Kidman’s female characters, both with a kind of push and pull on the prince’s very soul. Kidman’s queen and mother, when confronted by her son, becomes yet another obstacle and source of sorcery for Skarsgard to conquer. But, at this moment, he stalls like a stunned child. Kidman exerts such frightening and non-resonant power, by which I mean hardly anyone could relate to the game she’s playing. At least, no one would want to admit relating to that. And that’s an amazing feat.  When your movie begins with a foreboding shot of a premature (feels like it) volcanic eruption and a snarly and growly voice-over, you’re setting up for something that rarely could be lived up to. Something absurdly visionary, born of nightmares and male genetic jackhammering. True to this design, The Northman achieves this kind of ethereal environment and, surprisingly, another - something that resembles a high definition video game story mode. I couldn’t help but think of Crazy Samurai Musashi, a one-take sword-swiping escapade that’s more gameplay than narrative when watching The Northman. There is no second-hand experience with this film though; I didn’t feel as if I was impatiently watching my brother play something exciting. The excitement this time out was playing for me and me alone. "
"May 4, 2022",positive,"Drenched in testosterone, Northman is less concerned with reinventing the wheel with it's narrative built on the same mythology that inspired Hamlet, but rather with making you feel the visceral human anger and rage underpinning it's entire proceedings. "
"May 3, 2022",positive," In director Robert Eggers’ (“The Lighthouse”) latest, the ripped Swede portrays a Viking hell-bent on revenge alongside Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, and Björk. Robert Eggers crafts ancient fairy tales drenched in torment and madness, and The Northman proves a fable of fire, blood and fury that expands the ferocious scale of his folk-horror cinema. Fuming with a rage so fearsome as to be otherworldly, the latest from the director of The Witch and The Lighthouse is at once a kindred spirit to those masterful predecessors and a turning point for the 38-year-old auteur, employing his trademark aesthetics and atmosphere for a more streamlined and archetypal story about a Viking prince on a quest for revenge against his treacherous uncle. Coated in dirt and muck and stained in swaths of crimson, it’s a grand and gruesome epic of destiny and decapitations, malevolence and magic—a death-metal ode to honor, retribution and sacrifice that casts payback in a surprisingly, and thrillingly, positive light. With ripped abs and a cold, single-minded stare, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is a man without a home or a clan, living among other Viking marauders who believe themselves to be lycanthropic beasts, howling at the moon like wolves and roaring at the sky like bears around blazing campfires. By the time we meet Amleth, we already know what’s made him so feral, courtesy of an introductory 895 AD passage that focuses on the ordeal suffered by the young Amleth (Oscar Novak) years earlier, when his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returned home from battle to his Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Aurvandill is an aloof monarch to his wife but he exhibits rugged affection for his son, taking him to a forest temple where—under the guidance of court jester and spiritual shaman Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe)—they participate in a hallucinatory pagan ritual that links man to animal and allows Amleth to spy the Tree of Kings, which resides within their bloodline. Though Amleth is heir to the throne, his world is shattered when, following this mind-melting experience, his father is set upon and slain by Fjölnir in an act of betrayal that will forever shape the prince’s path. The Northman’s set-up is pure Conan the Barbarian, replete with heads being separated from shoulders by mighty blades in the snowy woods, and like John Milius’ 1982 gem, Eggers’ film carries itself like a legend, full of hulking mass and import (the only nod to historical reality is a brief mention of King Harald Fairhair). From the armor and fur cloaks worn by Aurvandill, to the mist and smoke that cover this chilly landscape, to the crunching footsteps of the men and horses that traverse it, the action moves like a lumbering goliath, trudging onward toward ruin, mayhem and tragedy that’s as inevitable as the rotation of the Earth. There’s mammoth weight to this saga, and once it shifts its attention to Skarsgård’s grown Amleth, that heft is embodied by its protagonist, who screams and bellows with a vehemence that’s also expressed through bludgeoning combat. From the desolate look on his face, it’s apparent that Amleth’s days of killing and pillaging are only temporary, and they conclude following an encounter with a blind Seeress (Björk, as mesmerizingly weird and chilling as expected) who prophecies that his fate is to avenge his father’s assassination on a fiery lake with a mythic steel sword, at which point a maiden king will assume the crown. This compels Amleth to join up with a group of slaves bound for the Icelandic homestead of Fjölnir, who despite his fratricidal perfidy has been reduced to living life as a farmer. In this group, Amleth meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), an imprisoned woman who speaks in outmoded tongues to the god of the soil, and together, they conspire to achieve Amleth’s ends, along the way falling in love. Amleth seeks to save his mother and murder his uncle, and he takes a slow-burn approach to serving Fjölnir his just deserts. Fjölnir doesn’t know Amleth’s true identity, and he and his arrogant and unworthy sons treat Amleth as a lowly piece of property. Much of The Northman’s middle passages involve the Viking’s acts of sly insurgence and stealthy terror, including dismembering two guards and impaling them against a hut in the shape of a steed. Everything builds toward inevitable hellfire and doom, and Eggers stages it with a methodical, head-down resolve that echoes the determination of Amleth, whom the magnetic Skarsgård turns into a figure of obsessive purpose, convinced that felling his disloyal uncle and liberating his mom are his sole reasons for existing, and will grant him the peace and freedom he’s never known. The Northman immerses itself in a pit of anguish and anger, equal parts mystical Valkyrie-and-Valhalla dreams and gritty real-world nightmares, and Eggers evokes it with his usual array of silky and muscular camerawork and gray-black imagery (via cinematographer Jarin Blaschke), as well as a Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough score of thunderous malice (here, punctuated by bagpipes). His cast is highly attuned to the dour and demented atmosphere he’s conjured; a merciless Bang and cruel Kidman tap into the ugliness of this bygone world, Taylor-Joy radiates holy hope as the sole person committed to Amleth’s enterprise, and Dafoe exudes a familiar brand of maniacal deviance. Noseless soldiers, human sacrifices, undead warrior kings and packs of wolves and birds (the latter imbued, as in The Lighthouse, with menacing spiritual power) are additional elements of this grim stew, which Eggers transforms into a primeval portrait of the desire to wrathfully redress past wrongs that can never be undone. Amleth executes his mission with ghastly resolution, and if The Northman boasts less of the delirious, spiraling lunacy of The Lighthouse, it makes up for it with broad-shouldered, battering-ram savagery shrouded in flickering gloom. His tableaus of agony and wonder enhanced by unsettling CGI, Eggers spins a yarn that’s 1,000 years old and yet pulses with timeless ire, his story locating the sweet spot where the archaic and the new seamlessly intertwine. Moreover, while his film adheres to the tenets of its chosen genre, it eschews the moralizing that often defines it, instead embracing the notion that vengeance can fuel a righteous cause rather than merely be an annihilating force that destroys the vengeful. There’s horror and insanity in The Northman’s vision of predestined reckonings, and also beauty in its final contention that some ordained undertakings are worth the blistering, brutal cost."
"May 2, 2022",positive," In early June Netflix is having a “Geeked Week,” featuring a lot of content geared towards genre fans. But it looks like that moment is already here, given the arrival of two films that could hardly be more custom-tooled towards a particular kind of cult cinephile, and which have both been eagerly awaited by that demographic for some time. Both could be nutshelled as “action movies,” but neither are exactly within the range of “normal” for that genre: One is by a bona fide auteur (and no, Michael Bay’s Ambulance a couple weeks ago did not count), while the other is, well, about as postmodernist as such things get. Robert Eggers has acquired considerable cache by directing two chamber-scaled period horror films that were really psychological thrillers, at least until the end. (And even then, you could argue whatever supernatural events occurred were only hallucinated by characters pushed past sanity.) 2015’s The Witch was an extraordinary portrait of religious fear and fanaticism amongst an exiled settler family in 1630s New England.  Three years later The Lighthouse, with Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattison as island station keepers going mad from isolation in the 1890s, was equally striking if arguably a mite less successful as a whole. Both were singular visions that had an uncompromising severity of style, atmosphere, and story content—something hard enough to pull off at all, let alone excite a fairly large general audience with. The Northman is something else entirely, though, a big, long, starry sword-and-sorcery epic that probably cost five or six times the combined production budgets of those prior features. It begins in the Ireland of 895 AD, as King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns from conquests abroad, eager to reunite with Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) and their son Prince Amelth (Oscar Novak), who at age 1o or so is considered ready to undergo a ritual passage to manhood under the guidance of his father’s holy fool Heimir (Dafoe). But soon after Aurvandill is murdered by his own jealous sibling Fjolnir (Claes Bang), forcing the boy to flee or be killed himself. When we next meet Amelth, he is played by the strapping Alexander Skarsgard, and is part of a roving band of bloodthirsty barbarians, raiding villages for loot and sport. He abandons that mercenary lot to pose as a captured slave upon learning that Fjolnir and Gudrun are now living in Icelandic exile. He then sets about proving himself “loyal” in many ways to gain access to the fallen royal couple, all the while scheming revenge—for his dead father, and for his presumably unwillingly-remarried mother. It’s a brutal, very masculine world, in which The Witch’s Anya Taylor-Joy (as a Slavic slave-sorceress-love interest) and Icelandic icon Bjork (in a glorified cameo as “The Seeress”) have the sole other female roles of note, ones that might easily have been cut with little change to the central plot. You can tell Eggers and co-scenarist Sjon were as scrupulous as possible about period veracity; like the director’s previous films, this one is visually arresting in ways that emphasize the physical challenges of landscape, custom, and era. All the performances are strong. Skarsgard was born for this kind of role, as he’s got the requisite awesome physique and heroic handsomeness, as well as the acting chops to create a credible real-world character rather than a cartoon action figure like Conan the Barbarian.

Yet impressive as it is in all these departments, The Northman—which the director did not have final cut control over, calling its post-production process “painful”—never quite transcends genre the way Eggers has before. It is an exceptionally serious (even humorless) Dark Ages spectacle of combat, adventure, and Shakespearean intrigue, with a dash of magic. But while it lacks the pulpier qualities of “Game of Thrones” or “The Vikings,” it nonetheless doesn’t land far enough from them in gist, nor from big-screen “muscleman” epics stretching from Steve Reeves to Schwarzenegger. Eggers hasn’t quite elevated the familiar conventions such that they become something else entirely, the way David Lowery did with the Arthurian saga in last year’s The Green Knight. Of course, you don’t hand someone $75-90 million and expect them to deliver anything in the realm of 1967 Czech Marketa Lazarova or Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2009 Valhalla Rising, two brutally “pure,” near-abstract representations of medieval hardship. That would be financial suicide. But for all its pagan mysticism, intelligent detail, and frequent beauty, The Northman ultimately feels like a fairly formulaic costume revenge tale—one with higher pretensions than most, to be sure, but not so much of a higher effect. It’s a good movie, yet also a little disappointing, because it’s not quite good enough to get away with being so little fun. There’s really nothing but fun on the agenda in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, which also opens in theaters nationwide Fri/22. Its central joke is, well, Nicolas Cage: Playing Nicolas Cage, semi-washed-up movie star, still starring in a whole lot of movies (most recent years he’s released about six per), their very erratic quality considered part of his charm—and of his self-harm. Given that he was known almost from the start for giving peculiar, over-the-top performances (even in mainstream hits like Peggy Sue Got Married or Moonstruck, but especially in quirkfests like Vampire’s Kiss, Wild at Heart and Raising Arizona), it seems rather astonishing in retrospect that for a while there, this weirdo was one of the most popular actors in the world, starring in at least a few of the most middle-of-the-road entertainments imaginable, from 1996’s The Rock to 2004’s National Treasure. But it didn’t last, and his increasingly busy, decreasingly selective filmography (purportedly encouraged by very spendy offscreen ways) gradually turned him into a sort of professional novelty act. How gonzo would he be this time? How random could his eccentricities get? Would they actually relate to the movie they’re in, or not? Will he elevate it, or sink it? Or if he’s in an infrequent earnest mode, will the effect be touching, or just seem disinterested? I have really enjoyed some Nic Cage performances and movies in recent years (chief among them Mandy, Mom & Dad, and last year’s Pig), but he remains a true wild card—not only in that you don’t know what he’ll do, but you don’t know whether what he does will be good for the movie, or even for Nicolas Cage. Unbearable Weight has the clever if risky (see: the cautionary example of Burt Reynolds’ 2017 quasi-swan song The Last Movie Star) idea of having its star basically play himself. Well, he is playing himself, Nicolas Cage, albeit a version that apparently took some arm-twisting before he was willing to accept: Endlessly self-absorbed, pretentious about his art (and its applied “shamanic thespian instincts”), very sensitive about criticisms re: his career trajectory, a bit too eager to please, borderline desperate to get “the role of a lifetime” that would put him back on top (but which he may be too no-longer-hot to win). In other words, exactly the mix of larger-than-life swaggering celebrity and terminally insecure basketcase we might well imagine Cage to be. That’s the Cage 2.0 director Tom Gormican and co-scenarist Kevin Etten levy upon a long-suffering fictive ex-wife (Sharon Horgan) and teenage daughter (Lily Sheen) who are really fed up with his shit. Particularly after he reacts to a professional setback by getting very drunk and extremely embarrassing at the latter’s 16th birthday party. Just as well, then, that the next gig arranged for him by agent Neil Patrick Harris is not a movie but a paid personal appearance at the estate of a rich Spanish superfan, alleged olive grower Javi (Pedro Pascal). Yes, it is demeaning to parade one’s nearly-60-year-old self before complete strangers and pretend to be their “friend” just for a $1 million paycheck. But such are the travails of a former-A-list actor. Belying his luxurious digs and high security, turns out Javi appears a pretty nice guy, as well as a sincerely flattering fan. And despite the occasional harassing inner-voice snark from his younger self (“Nicky,” Cage digitally youthified to the mid-1980s), our protagonist has started to actually enjoy this sojourn when he is informed by two CIA agents (Tiffany Hadish, Ike Barinholtz) that they require his cooperation. Javi, they say, is in truth a “violent international arms cartel” chief whose goons just kidnapped the teenage daughter of a Latin American president he wants ousted. The captive girl may even be held on the premises where the star of Face/Off and Con Air is currently boozily suntanning.  For America, for love of decency, he must use his acting skills to make like a spy, perhaps even an action hero to save her. What could be easier? How many times before has he played that kinda part? Could it be so hard to do “for real”? Needless to say: Oh yes it could. Unbearable Weight is not deep, but it juggles a lot of balls rather delightfully, paying affectionate homage to its “fucking legend” star while also ridiculing him (and letting him ridicule himself), operating as an actual action movie while parodying the genre. There are a bazillion references to past Nicolas Cage films—you might even say the passage in which he and Pascal trip on LSD is one long bow to his screen gonzo-dom. Yet a measure of the film’s essential good naturedness is that the best cinephile in-joke here is a running gag reference to a movie he had nothing to do with: Paddington 2, the cuddly 2017 sequel that could well be the single best feature film of the last decade no childless adult ever even thought about watching.  Why is it plugged so incongruously in this goofy fan-flick for grownups? Well why not?! Paddington 2 really is all that. And The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent only makes itself even more agreeable for saying so.The Northman and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent both open at theaters throughout the Bay Area on Fri/22. 48 Hills welcomes comments in the form of letters to the editor, which you can submit here.

"May 2, 2022",positive," The tale of Amleth, or the legend that inspired it, was the inspiration for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” Titled “The Northman” in this Robert Eggers version, the two stories have much in common.  Eggers is both a researcher and a filmmaker. His movies “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” were based on writings from the eras in which they were set. He wrote this one with the Icelandic poet Sjón to create an accurate depiction of Viking life. The tale is set just before 930 A.D. We meet Amleth as a boy whose father (Ethan Hawke) initiates him as a prince in a ceremony conducted by a shaman (played by an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe.) The boy runs away, and is said to be dead. But Amleth survives on his rage, and vows to avenge his father, kill his uncle and save his mother. Amleth grows into a strong, violent brute, killing almost at will while he wanders. After he discovers his uncle and mother now live in Iceland, he poses as a slave to reach them.  It wouldn’t be fair to tell you the rest of it. Although it is not a fantasy, it does involve fortunes being told – I was reminded a couple of times of The Weird Sisters – and ritual, as well as a magical sword. The performances, not surprisingly, are superlative, and so are the visuals. Watch the details in the objects and the extras who populate the environments. Eggers has created a stunning, harsh world. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"May 1, 2022",neutral," With an obsessive attention to historical detail and a fascination with lore, language, and ritual, there is no mistaking THE NORTHMAN for the work of anyone but Robert Eggers (“The Witch” “The Lighthouse”). But despite a bigger budget and a much bigger canvas, does the director’s new Viking revenge epic add up to anything but a bloody good time? Along with that review, Adam and Josh return to the Buster Keaton Marathon with the actor/director’s first masterpiece, 1924's SHERLOCK JR."
"May 1, 2022",positive," The Northman is a film that’s right up my alley. From the setting to the buckets of blood spilled over the 2+ hour runtime, it’s a violent, visceral, and engrossing voyage. And I was hooked for every minute of it. It also continues to mark Robert Eggers as a director to watch. Additionally, fans of his work on The Witch and The Lighthouse are probably purchasing their tickets as we speak. But what makes this film worth a watch? Here are three reasons why you should watch The Northman. Eggers has worked with some of Hollywood’s most prolific actors, including Anya-Taylor Joy and Willem Dafoe. The Northman boasts what may be his most impressive cast yet including those two. The narrative focuses on Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), who seeks vengeance against his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) for murdering his father Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) and kidnapping his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Along the way, Amneth encounters the witch Olga (Joy), and the two form a partnership that quickly grows romantic. Much of the cast has previously starred in genre fare. Skarsgard is best known for his role in HBO’s True Blood, while Hawke is playing Arthur Harrow in Moon Knight and Bang portrayed Dracula in the BBC’s adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel. And as mentioned before, both Joy and Dafoe have had roles in Eggers’ previous films and show up here – Dafoe shines in a brief role as Heimir the Fool, who despite his name is responsible for sending Amleth on the path to manhood. Skarsgard himself carries the film on his extremely ripped shoulders. He runs through a gauntlet of emotions, from fury to sorrow to passion. And his chemistry with Joy is electric. Another reason to watch The Northman? Well, the film has been described as “Arthouse Conan The Barbarian” and that’s not far off, as the fight scenes in this film are extremely grisly. Heads are hacked off, warriors are impaled, and literal blood and guts fly across the screen. One warrior even has his nose bitten off in a particularly gruesome scene. However, the end fight is truly amazing – I don’t want to spoil what happens, but it’s definitely worth the price of admission. What really makes the fight scenes stand out is how Eggers and his go-to cinematographer Jarin Blaschke stage them. A fight in a tomb features a shining beam of moonlight, which bathes a brutal fight scene in unusually soft lighting. Another scene features snow covering a forest, which serves as prelude to slaughter. This movie may be brutal, but it’s also surprisingly beautiful – and shows that Eggers made good use of the $90 million budget. With a narrative that takes place in the time of Vikings, and a screenplay that was co-written by Icelandic poet Sjón, it’s only natural that Norse myth plays a role in The Northman. Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, is often referred to and even features in a dream sequence as a glowing tree comprised entirely of light, with bodies hanging from its branches. Another dream sequence features a Valkyrie riding through the sky, her face contorted in a roar of primal fury. Not only does the use of Norse myth play into the setting, but it also continues a trend of surreal imagery that’s permeated all of Eggers’ films. These are just a few of the reasons why you should watch The Northman. it hits that sweet spot between “arthouse cinema” and “adrenaline-pumping revenge film”, and like Everything Everywhere All At Once proves that indie features can appeal to mainstream audiences. The Northman also marks a trio of new releases including The Bad Guys and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, which proves that there is a wealth of options in the theaters besides superheroes and remakes. Born and raised in Texas, Collier “CJ” Jennings was introduced to geekdom at an early age by his father, who showed him Ultraman and Star Trek: The Next Generation.

"Apr 30, 2022",positive," Robert Eggers is behind the camera in this historical epic that seems to have appeared on cinema screens with little fanfare. This in itself is strange, as the film is by nature a bombastic and energetic presentation that revels in its own energy, and embraces everything that such a film can represent. Apparently, Eggers and the film’s lead Alexander Skarsgard wanted to do a Viking movie together, so The Northman became a labor of love for both artists. The story of revenge is a well worn one, but the setting and mystical presentation of the themes elevate this production for audiences that may initially feel they have seen this story done before, and despite the criticism from some that the accents are a bit weird, the performances here are well above average with the no-compromise direction producing a visceral and often shocking finished product. With a cast that includes Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, and Anya Taylor-Joy, it seems incredible that with a budget of just 70 million, the film pulls itself together so satisfyingly. Admittedly a lot of the bigger names here provide just slightly more than cameos, but you can’t help wonder if some of the cast worked here for cheap. Skarsgard plays Amleth, the Northman of the title, who witnesses the murder of his father by his uncle, in a Shakespearian style plot point, and is forced to flee as his uncle takes control of his brother’s land. He vows revenge, and we follow his journey towards a final confrontation. The film manages to juggle all the tropes you might expect in this kind of film, with some very stylistic directorial flair that elevates this to a more artistic production than you might expect. If you are of a certain age, you may remember the Robin of Sherwood TV show from the 80s. The show reimagined the Robin Hood legend and used mysticism and magic to add new nuances to it. Well watching The Northman, you get a similar feeling. Basically, this is a violent tale of revenge, yet we are presented with witches, visions, and often MCU levels of action sequences, that blend perfectly. The balance between some truly violent imagery and the more fantastical lifts the screenplay away from your basic historical adventure into a more complex narrative. Exciting and sprawling, The Northman is almost a throwback to an earlier time of movie-making, with a story of redemption, presented in a fascinating and spellbinding way. Impossible to turn away from, this movie has style and substance and is probably in my top ten films of the year so far. Its one problem is perhaps its run time, which could have possibly been trimmed down just slightly to tighten up the final act, but apart from that, this is a triumph of action-adventure filmmaking that you should check out if you like this type of thing.

"Apr 30, 2022",positive," Robert Eggers again reminds us that he hasn’t adopted filmmaking as merely a vocation but a platform to tell stories that haven’t been told – or in the least, told LIKE THIS, with his 10th century Icelandic actioner The Northman. In what can only be described as a brutal, testosterone-fueled profusion of ”Game of Thrones”, 300, and Kill Bill, Eggers (The Lighthouse) and co-writer Sjorn serve up a ‘ye old tale’ of nipple sweat and literal head-bashing that follows a young Viking’s (Alexander Skarsgard, looking ever the spokesperson for Gold’s Gym) pursuit of the hardhearted killer (Claes Bang) that took the breath from his father (Ethan Hawke) and stole his momma (Nicole Kidman). When Prince Amleth catches up with the treacherous ‘uncle’, the bad dude has lost his throne and is now ruling a smaller village. The determined terminator plays the part of a slave as long as he can – before the shadow of the moon, a witch, and his fondness for fellow hand, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) suggest the time is ripe to make his move. One time HBO pin-up Alexander Skarsgard (“True Blood”), and his workout regime, rule the roost here but Nicole Kidman is equally impressive (the likes of which she hadn’t been in quite a while, in my opinion) as the title character’s ‘complex’ momma. Hawke and Willem Dafoe, in extended cameos, also add to the tasty meat at the core of this beast’s bones. Much of the praise though belongs to the production team – skilled, imaginative visionary Eggers, the stupendous production design of, and cinematographer, who skillfully and flaringly capture the beauty and blood of a nightmarish past. It won’t be for all, particularly those with a weak stomach, but it deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as it can. Another fine notch in the ‘2022 movies’ belt."
"Apr 30, 2022",positive," You may have never heard of the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, but you’re likely familiar with his story regardless. After all, the medieval saga of a prince out for revenge against the uncle who murdered his father and stole his throne was the direct inspiration for one of Shakespeare’s most famous tragedies, right down to the anagram used for the hero’s name. Needless to say, it’s a tale most of us have seen told before on stage and screen…but perhaps not quite like this. The third feature film directed by Robert Eggers (following The Witch and The Lighthouse), The Northman violently embraces all of the hallucinatory magic and rampant bloodshed of Scandinavian lore in bringing Amleth’s story to the screen. Co-written with Icelandic writer and lyricist Sjón⁠ — a frequent collaborator of Björk, who introduced him to Eggers and makes her long-awaited return to the screen here ⁠— The Northman isn’t exactly telling an original story, but it is an enjoyable one, especially if you’re already a fan of Eggers’ incredibly immersive cinematic style.Death Before DishonorThe film opens with the long-awaited return of King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) to his kingdom on the Northern Atlantic island of Hrafnsey. Here, he is reunited with his queen, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and his young son and heir, Amleth (played as a child by Oscar Novak).After spending the entire night undergoing a super-freaky spiritual ritual led by the jester Heimir (Willem Dafoe), the king and his son emerge into the bright light of day only to be ambushed by the king’s bastard brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Fjölnir and his men kill Aurvandill and raid his kingdom, murdering innocent villagers and making off with Gudrún as a prize. But Amleth manages to escape, rowing himself to safety across the stormy sea and fiercely declaring through his grief, “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.”source: Focus FeaturesYears later, Amleth is a Viking warrior (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) who seems more animal than man, howling with bloodlust under a wolfskin as he raids a village in the faraway land of Rus. However, a chance encounter with a seeress (Björk, doing incredible Björk things that only Björk can do) reminds Amleth of his sworn quest for revenge.Turns out, Fjölnir has lost the throne for which he committed the sin of fratricide, and is now living in exile in Iceland with Gudrún and his two sons. So, Amleth smuggles himself aboard a ship of slaves bound for Fjölnir’s farm, befriending a Slavic witch named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and settling the wheels of fate back in motion. But the path to vengeance is full of bumps and twists, and reminders that the stories one believes as a child do not always match up with the endings one encounters as an adult.Visions and NightmaresFrom Jarin Blaschke’s gorgeous location cinematography to Craig Lathrop’s incredibly detailed production design, The Northman transports the audience through time and space to a long-lost land of sorcery and savagery. Every frame is splattered with mud and mead and blood, and the battle scenes are awesome to behold. However, the film’s most thrilling imagery is also some of its most fantastical: the vision of the tree of kings that traces Amleth’s noble bloodline, the Valkyrie who Amleth dreams will escort him to Valhalla, the undead king who Amleth must fight for custody of the sword he is fated to wield.More than any other up-and-coming director working right now, Eggers — who began his creative career as a production designer ⁠— is capable of making the atmosphere of the movie theater around you so totally melt away that even the sounds of crying children and crunching popcorn cannot pull you back to your present reality before the end credits begin to roll. It helps that Eggers has surrounded himself with an established company of brilliant craftspeople; both Blaschke and Lathrop worked on The Witch and The Lighthouse, and deserve nearly as much credit as the director for rendering the wild, weird worlds of these films so utterly immersive. Whether or not you want to be there is something else altogether, but I personally have enjoyed each and every trip they have taken me on.source: Focus FeaturesThis willingness to go as far as humanly possible to make his films feel authentic to the period in which they take place extends to Eggers’ screenwriting. From the archaic dialogue in The Witch (much of which was pulled straight from historical accounts of witchcraft) to the saltwater-soaked sailor slang of The Lighthouse, the characters in his films can often be difficult to understand. The Northman is not nearly as borderline-incomprehensible as those previous films, but it does feature enough throaty growling and hoarse howling to give one sympathy pains in the throat⁠ — not to mention, plenty of epic declarations about meeting one’s enemies at the Gates of Hel, natch. Some of it feels a bit silly, but in a way that I personally quite enjoyed. After all, who wouldn’t get all riled up to destroy one’s enemies after hearing some of Skarsgård’s full-blooded monologues?Speaking of Skarsgård, who co-produced The Northman and for whom starring in a Viking saga has been a longtime goal: he is excellent as Amleth. While much will be (and has been) made of his extreme physical transformation for this film, one should not let his outrageous muscles distract you from what is a truly powerful performance. (Okay, the muscles can distract you a little bit.) The rest of the cast is also remarkable, but that shouldn’t be a surprise considering the names filling it out: from Kidman as the icy, secretive Gudrún to Bang as the menacing Fjölnir to Dafoe as the wonderfully weird Heimir, the actors in The Northman bring out all of the hidden complexities in characters that are otherwise archetypes cut and pasted from the legend of Amleth and other ancient Viking tales. Taylor-Joy in particular is a delight to watch as the ethereal Olga; her unusual beauty and otherworldly presence add some important feminine energy to the story and ensure that you’ll find yourself missing her whenever she happens to not be on screen. This is her second collaboration with Eggers following The Witch, and needless to say, I cannot wait to see what they do together in their upcoming reimagining of Nosferatu.ConclusionBoth beautiful and brutal, The Northman is a saga worth seeing.What do you think?

Turns out, Fjölnir has lost the throne for which he committed the sin of fratricide, and is now living in exile in Iceland with Gudrún and his two sons. So, Amleth smuggles himself aboard a ship of slaves bound for Fjölnir’s farm, befriending a Slavic witch named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and settling the wheels of fate back in motion. But the path to vengeance is full of bumps and twists, and reminders that the stories one believes as a child do not always match up with the endings one encounters as an adult. From Jarin Blaschke’s gorgeous location cinematography to Craig Lathrop’s incredibly detailed production design, The Northman transports the audience through time and space to a long-lost land of sorcery and savagery. Every frame is splattered with mud and mead and blood, and the battle scenes are awesome to behold. However, the film’s most thrilling imagery is also some of its most fantastical: the vision of the tree of kings that traces Amleth’s noble bloodline, the Valkyrie who Amleth dreams will escort him to Valhalla, the undead king who Amleth must fight for custody of the sword he is fated to wield.More than any other up-and-coming director working right now, Eggers — who began his creative career as a production designer ⁠— is capable of making the atmosphere of the movie theater around you so totally melt away that even the sounds of crying children and crunching popcorn cannot pull you back to your present reality before the end credits begin to roll. It helps that Eggers has surrounded himself with an established company of brilliant craftspeople; both Blaschke and Lathrop worked on The Witch and The Lighthouse, and deserve nearly as much credit as the director for rendering the wild, weird worlds of these films so utterly immersive.

"Apr 29, 2022",positive," Vengeance is an easy desire to rationalize. The injustice of suffering leaves a void that the heart naturally wants to fill. The cost of delivering such retribution often plays second fiddle to the mind’s manifestation of the sweet delight seemingly offered by correcting an egregious wrong. Of course, the world is not a binary of good vs. evil, not that vengeance has to care about such realities. The Northman follows a life of vengeance. An adaptation of the legend of Amleth, a Scandinavian figure more familiar to Western audiences for inspiring Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the narrative follows the prince (Alexander Skarsgård, with Oscar Vovak playing Amleth as a young boy) as he seeks to avenge the death of his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who also burned his village and abducted his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Prophecy shapes Amleth’s quest, believing himself to be put on the soil solely to take his uncle’s life. Amleth gives up a promising career as a Viking berserker to stow away aboard a slave ship headed to Iceland, the seat of his uncle’s exile. Becoming enslaved himself in the process, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sorceress and kindred spirit. As Amleth and Olga grow closer, the prince faces a fork in the road, the cost of his quest for vengeance contrasted by the prospects of breaking the cycle, to forge a new path free of the endless violence. Director Robert Eggers delivers a slow-burn that’s singularly focused in its step-by-step depiction of Amleth’s submission to prophecy. Just as good and evil exist outside a binary, the question of nature vs. nurture is a bit irrelevant when faced with a reality where the two work in almost-complete tandem. Violence may not be the only life that Amleth could choose to live, but it is the only life he knows how to live. Eggers’ every motion hammers that point home. The cast all seem to understand their place less as characters, but as part of the legend. Eggers seems to understand the weight of epic, the performances and cinematography carrying a soft touch even amidst the narrative’s extreme brutality. Skarsgård never once puffs his chest to assert his place as the hero, in complete alignment with Amleth’s sense of prophecy bestowed upon him at an early age. His approach to character development feels almost more like character actualization than any real sense of growth. Not all boys change as they grow into men. The supporting cast, also including Willem Dafoe and Björk in bit roles, have quite a lot of fun with the material. The 137-minute runtime is a bit over-bloated, but Eggers never loses his grip on his audience through the cerebral narrative. Larger-than-life material is rarely delivered with such serene execution. Epics are not necessarily meant to feel intimate, yet The Northman carries itself like performers in a black box theatre, welcoming even against a backdrop of endless miles of nothingness. The Northman demonstrates Eggers’ immense maturity as a filmmaker, a testament to cinema’s power to communicate rich art to a wide audience. In a world full of crowd-pleaser films fighting for their share of the box office, the film instead aims to leave its viewers with a calmer sense of satisfaction by the time the credits roll. It feels good to be challenged in the theatre, to see an epic wrestle with morals humanity has been grappling with for hundreds of years. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary!

"Apr 29, 2022",positive,"The storyline was simple yet effective. The landscape, the production values -- I was all in."
"Apr 29, 2022",positive,"Overall, despite the lavish treatment, the film is surprisingly dreary..."
"Apr 29, 2022",positive," I'll be honest, it didn't take much to sell me on ""The Northman."" The stunning look of it, the particular period setting, the epic scale, its gritty edge -- all of those things are right up my alley. And then there's the film's director, Robert Eggers. I loved his 2015 debut feature ""The Witch."" And while I was pretty lukewarm on his 2019 follow-up ""The Lighthouse,"" it was still an audacious bit of maverick filmmaking. Both of those movies bear many of the same marks of their creator. They're both rooted in Eggers' interests in folk horror and legend. Both show off a near obsessive level of period detail. Both are clearly made by someone fully embracing their creative freedoms. And both feel completely original and unlike anything else that may fall close to their ""genres."" ""The Northman"" is what you get when those very distinct creative signatures are used to tell a bigger story with a bigger cast and with a much bigger studio budget (in this case nearly $90 million). Penned by Eggers and Icelandic screenwriter, poet and novelist Sjon, ""The Northman"" is a brutal and at times bonkers Viking revenge epic based on the same Scandinavian legend that inspired Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" Set in the North Atlantic at the turn of the 10th century, Eggers sits us down in a brawny and violent world, caked in mud and stained with blood. It's a world where human savagery is more commonplace than anything resembling compassion. And where the supernatural and occult co-exist, allowing the director to veer down some dark and twisted paths. More specifically based on the legend of Amleth, ""The Northman"" opens up with a table-setting prologue that sets this revenge-soaked tale in motion. In it, 10-year-old Prince Amleth (played by Oscar Novak) enthusiastically greets his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) who is returning home from battle. Wounded and weary, Aurvandil decides it's time to begin preparing his son to take his throne. With the help of the wild-eyed shaman Heimir (Willem Dafoe), Aurvandil leads his son through a gonzo ritualistic rite of passage involving blood oaths, trippy visions and flatulence (it's the first of several scenes sure to test mainstream audiences). The next morning, after a night of unconventional bonding, the course of Amleth's life is changed after he witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) butcher his father and kidnap his now widowed mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). With Fjolnir's bloodcurdling command ""Bring me the boy's head!"" still echoing through the thick air, Amlith flees by boat repeating to himself a mantra that will burn into his soul and fuel his hate for the rest of the film, ""I will avenge you father. I will save you mother. I will kill you Fjolnir."" The screen fades to black and many years pass. When the image returns we see a much older Amleth (played by a hulking Alexander Skarsgard), now a member of a barbaric Viking clan who ravage the Land of the Rus like a pack of ravenous wolves. Here we get one of the film's more spectacular moments -- an incredible single uninterrupted take of the berserkers raiding, pillaging and slaughtering a Slavic village. The intensely difficult and complex sequence sees Eggers and his go-to DP Jarin Blaschke weaving their camera through the chaos and carnage, sucking us into the sheer savagery of the scene. It's gruesome and unflinching. It's also incredible filmmaking. Upon getting word that Fjolnir has now settled in Iceland with Gudrun as his captive wife, Amleth stows away on a boat posing as a slave. There he meets a fellow captive who introduces herself as ""Olga of the Birch Forest"" (Anya Taylor-Joy). She claims to be a sorceress and the two form an immediate bond. ""Your strength breaks men's bones,"" she utters, hinting at an inevitable partnership. ""I have the cunning to break their minds."" The two arrive at Fjolnir's settlement and are immediately put to work. But rather than killing Fjolnir and his men like a rabid beast, Amleth begins a methodical campaign of physical and psychological terror, brutally picking off his prey one-by-one in the dark of night and sending waves of fear throughout the commune. While Eggers is clearly the architect and his fingerprints are everywhere, the movie succeeds thanks to a fine collective effort. Blaschke's camera not only captures the ferocity of the action, but also the beautiful yet harsh textures of the Icelandic landscape. There's also the amazing period richness of Craig Lathrop's production design and Linda Muir's costumes. Add to it the pulse-pounding propulsion of Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough's score. Of course you also have the cast ably led by Skarsgard. He's an imposing mix of cold primal rage and quiet intensity. And though aptly (and somewhat comically) described as a ""Beast cloaked in man-flesh,"" Skarsgard also reveals Amleth's pain and vulnerability. Kidman is a blast, Hawke is as wily as ever, and Bang is pure villain material. Amid the showers of blood, the grime-covered abs and hallucinatory mindtrips lies a fairly basic story. Sure, it features a screaming Valkyrja (Ineta Sliuzaite), a creepy soothsaying seeress (Bjork), and crows working at the behest of Odin himself. Yet the story remains simple. It's the creative juices of Robert Eggers that gives ""The Northman"" its unique identity, from the impeccable detail and design to the wild flourishes and overindulgences. Now where will such a movie land with audiences? That's the $90 million question.

"Apr 28, 2022",negative," You would be forgiven for expecting more from The Northman. If you’re a fan of writer-director Robert Eggers, you might expect something weirder, along the lines of his previous triumphs in the horror/suspense genre. If you bought a ticket based on the trailers alone, knowing nothing of the celebrated auteur behind the film, you might expect something more straightforward: the gritty, action-adventure extravaganza promised by shots of Alexander Skarsgård catching spears midair. What you’ll get is neither the bold weirdness of Eggers’s previous efforts in the critically-acclaimed margins nor a clean strike into the blockbuster mainstream. Instead, The Northman wavers hesitantly within subversion before ultimately embracing its subject: the classical Hero’s Journey. More specifically, The Northman purports to represent a quintessential narrative of masculinity, in which homosocial codes of war and honor clash with the emotional bonds of love and family. As an Eggers fan myself, I expected him to twist this familiar narrative somehow, to upend and trouble it or at least pervert it a little. But I am left scratching my head at this intensely literal take on traditional Western masculinity, which nonetheless joins a host of other recent neo-medievalist and folk horror films in expressing a particular kind of Anthropocene angst by ambivalently upholding a premodern, preindustrial existence. The Northman begins with a feint at subverting the ultra-masculine archetype of the Viking. In one of the first scenes, we witness young protagonist Prince Amleth (Skarsgård) initiated by his father into warrior-manhood, only to find that the proof of worthiness is how well one can belch or fart on command. But no amount of Willem Dafoe’s (admittedly delightful) crazy-eyed vamping troubles the classic story that unfolds from there: Just like his literary descendent Hamlet, Amleth trains himself to avenge his murdered father, loses himself to hatred, is forced to self-examine, then achieves his vengeance as a wiser man. His being sidetracked by love of a beautiful woman (Anya Taylor-Joy) is merely another expected trope. There is an attempt to complicate the narrative when, in the film’s best scene, Amleth’s mother (Nicole Kidman) reveals that his revered father was actually a brute and that she was his slave before she was his queen. But we nevertheless end up with Amleth completing his journey in melodramatic man-to-man combat. The dead Amleth is carried to Valhalla by a Valkyrie, his purpose fulfilled. The fact that both men are nude in this final fight is not a stripping-away of their vainglory but a celebration of their impossibly-chiseled, blood-and-mud-smeared physiques: the “thinking man’s” Marvel superheroes. Skarsgård’s trapezius muscles are so overbuilt, he literally cannot stand up straight and instead hunches in an effect both menacing and a little ridiculous. Eggers’s succumbing to Viking nostalgia can be read as part and parcel of the recent surge of similarly nostalgic films that imagine a more epic, more authentic past, specifically a British and Scandinavian one. Last year’s The Green Knight also depicts a medieval warrior, this time an Arthurian knight, maturing through magical and emotional trials. The Last Duel (2021) transposes contemporary discourse around sexual assault onto poignantly antiquated trial-by-combat. Even nonhistorical films, like the many folk horror revivals which seem to critique this kind of nostalgia, also uphold it, betraying a growing contemporary longing for a romanticized European past. The spectacular Midsommar (2019), written and directed by Eggers’s peer in elevated horror, Ari Aster, both condemns the violence of the neo-Norse cult at its center but also celebrates its “healthier,” unflinching approach to grief and death compared to the suppressed Americans it victimizes.  Yet where Midsommar leaves us decidedly uncomfortable with our nostalgic longing (Twitter argues monthly over whether its ending is “good” or “bad, actually”), The Northman offers only the shadow of such nuance. If this trend reflects the more generalized desire of an alienated white American populace for reconnection with a spiritual/cultural heritage, what does The Northman reveal? It holds up a white prince dispossessed of his birthright, building himself into a killing machine, rebuked a little by the women around him who encourage him to love and cry, but ultimately dying a badass warrior in a volcano. Amleth dies ostensibly to protect his unborn children, proclaiming that he “choose[s] both” family and vengeance—the film literally trying to have it both ways. Eggers seems to be saying that contemporary (white) men can embrace the warrior ethos embodied in the Viking while maintaining their postmodern emotional enlightenment. But, in the end, just as Amleth favors Odin, god of war, and rejects the fertility god Freyr (whom he derides as the “god of erections”), what the film truly glories in is battle and death, not love and family.  So where does that leave us? The Northman is not a bad film. It has interesting visuals and offers a few surprises. Skarsgård gives an excellent performance, making the best out of some truly wooden lines. But I can’t help but be disappointed that Eggers took this politically and socially fraught figure, the Viking, and played it so straight. Bros who fantasize about the Viking “good old days” will find very little to challenge them in The Northman. And so ultimately, the film’s avowed moral and what it actually delivers are at odds, making this male power fantasy especially uneasy. Perhaps that’s why The Northman harps so much on the inescapability of fate. The belief in destiny alleviates fear, but it also disavows responsibility."
"Apr 28, 2022",positive," I recently rewatched Robert Eggers' debut film, “The Witch,” and it’s legitimately impressive this guy gets to keep making the movies he wants to make. A supernatural folk tale set in 1630s New England with period-accurate dialogue didn’t scream “breakout hit,” but thanks to the director’s firm vision and a lead performance by a young Anya Taylor-Joy, he was given a long leash for future projects. He followed that up with “The Lighthouse,” another period film that explored loneliness and isolation with deeply committed performances from Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. It was a critical favorite but not exactly accessible to wide audiences. (Fun fact from the press junket for Eggers’ latest, “The Northman”: Taylor-Joy revealed she volunteered to play a mermaid in the film. Eggers wisely told her she didn’t want to play that mermaid.) But Eggers is also commanding a bigger budget than he’s ever had (reportedly around $60 million), so he’s also made one of his more accessible movies. One concession he made was having characters in his Viking epic speak English instead of the original Norse. We meet the titular character as young Prince Amleth, who witnesses the murder of his father (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his uncle (Claes Bang) who then takes Amleth’s mother (Nicole Kidman) as his bride. Young Amleth’s memorable refrain from the trailer is a pretty good plot summary: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Skip ahead a couple of decades. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has spent this time getting ripped and plotting his vengeance. His path back to Fjölnir has him joining forces with Olga of the Birch Forest (Taylor-Joy), who’s been taken as a slave and spoil of war. Eggers’ biggest movie to date, “The Northman” truly feels big. Big sets, big battle sequences and big themes. Eggers shows he’s ready for the jump to a bigger budget. Speaking of Icelandic icons, Eggers co-wrote the script with writer Sjón, Icelandic poet, novelist and lyricist who recently penned “Lamb,” as well as Björk’s foray into the world of Lars von Trier, “Dancer in the Dark.” While primarily a character study for Skarsgård’s Amleth and his journey for vengeance, the script goes big, as well, paying a reverent debt to Nordic mythology with a plot that’s complex but mostly clearly defined. Eggers continues to showcase a mastery for exploring this kind of folklore in another authentic period piece. I’d be curious to see what his style would be like on a more modern story, but “The Northman” nevertheless marks him as a director with an exceptional vision."
"Apr 28, 2022",positive,"""The Northman"" is a sweeping epic driven by blood and brutality, offering up a bleak and unrelenting take on the legend that inspired it. It might be great - hell, it almost certainly IS great - but sadly, it left me behind."
