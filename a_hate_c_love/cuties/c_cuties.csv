"Mar 13, 2023",positive," Growing up is messy and alienating. The confusing process of finding your own identity and the best crowd can be overwhelming at any age, but especially in a moment when self-esteem is so precarious, and the biggest concern you have is to be liked by others. In addition, today’s environment is not a friendly one. The Internet, social media, and the expectations of society make it too hard to grow up unscathed. This reflection is at the center of Cuties. The movie portrays the complicated path of maturity and finding yourself. Nevertheless, unsatisfied with this scenario, director Maïmouna Doucouré focuses this coming of age story in a Black Senegalese girl trying to adapt in a foreign country and a liberal society, completely different from her conservative background. Cuties follows the story of Amy (Fathia Youssouf, with a wide-eyed face and a nervous smile), an 11-year-old girl that must deal with too much at once. She has arrived in Paris with her mother and two baby brothers, and her father will join them soon after. Her position as the oldest sister means that she must take care of her siblings – including an adorable Demba Diaw – while embracing her community’s old traditions. In addition, her relationship with her mother is complicated, who is struggling with her own grief after discovering that her polygamous husband will arrive in France with a new wife. Once Amy arrives in her new school, her sight is caught by a group of young girls that seem to own the place. The typical mean girls that destabilize your whole world and make you want to be part of theirs, even if their attitudes and actions go against your own. In this aspect, Amy’s new conundrum is too real and identifiable. Every girl has been there. These girls are confident, extroverts, and dressed in too provocative attires for 11-year-olds. They also have a dancing group called Cuties, copying their moves from mature, and yet accessible, music videos. Amy will do everything in her power to be part of this gang, even when they treat her wrongly and call her names. In a matter of days, Amy changes her appearance, adopts new attitudes towards her family, and starts making questionable decisions. Soon enough, she is an entirely different person, even going further than her new friends had ever gone before and adopting attitudes that are too complex and sexual for her to even understand. It is easy to understand that this movie reflects the complications of growing up in a lonesome way. These girls are lost and afraid, with no figure guiding them through these confusing times. The feeling of aloneness is at the heart of the movie. “Cuties” has inadvertently become the target of conservative critics in an overwhelming discrediting campaign. What would have been a success story of a French-Senegalese director selling her first movie to Netflix, after positive reactions in Sundance, became a nightmarish experience because of a careless marketing strategy by the streaming giant, which was obscenely exploited by conservative trolls. However, reducing this movie only to its evident critique of the over-sexualization of girls would be too easy and narrow-minded. As a matter of fact, Amy’s thoughts regarding her father’s decisions, combined with her apprehension towards the changes in her household and body, are the most interesting things of the movie. Her rebelliousness even feels revolutionary. The movie does not shy away from uncomfortable topics that are present in real life, and that shape our process of maturity and attainment of self-esteem. Cuties reflects the real-life emotional abuse that young girls suffer through examples of slut and fat-shaming, over-sexualization of girls, the inappropriate content in the media, and how easy it is for children to get access to it. Although hard to watch at times – precisely when the director makes it evident that the girls are acting foolishly – the movie accurately portrays the complications and conflicts of growing up. Now regardless of its quality, it seems that Cuties has been judged and condemned. This is the real tragedy considering that the movie is directly criticizing the things that it is being attacked for. Furthermore, many of the themes and emotions that are part of our protagonist’s story are recognizable, more so if the audiences are formed by (Black) women and foreigners trying to adapt to a new social paradigm. As such, it is impossible not to feel protective of the movie. Sometimes uncomfortable and others too radical, Cuties is an eye-opener with an inspired ending, despite the troublesome scenes we witnessed seconds earlier. People should be concerned, not at the movie itself, but at the realities that it clearly reflects."

"May 10, 2021",positive," Cuties has already been condemned by hundreds of thousands of people who will never even watch it. When it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, this deliberately discomfiting, French coming-of-age drama won largely (though not unequivocally) positive reviews. It only became a cause célèbre a few weeks ago, when Netflix shared a promotional poster showing four pre-teen girls – each around 11 years old – imitating very adult poses familiar from countless recent music videos. More than 300,000 people signed a petition accusing the film of sexualising “an 11-year-old for the viewing pleasure of paedophiles”, prompting Netflix to apologise for the artwork which was “inappropriate” and “not representative” of the film. Director Maïmouna Doucouré has since received death threats, and said last week that Netflix’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos called her personally to apologise. That apology was definitely warranted because Doucouré is clearly trying to hold up a mirror here; her film is a powerful exploration of the way young girls are subconsciously encouraged to perform for the male gaze. She lifts the lid through the heartbreaking growing pains of 11-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf), a young girl living in a humble Paris apartment with her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) and two younger siblings. Amy’s father is still in Senegal, where the family hail from, but will soon be joining them in Paris with his second wife in tow. Mariam is devastated to have to share her husband, but is urged by her stoic, old-school aunt (Mbissine Therese Diop) to put on a brave face in front of the community. The aunt also wields a significant influence on Amy, telling her a “grandiose wedding” to a suitable man should be her ultimate goal in life. Doucouré, who is also of Senegalese heritage, neatly illustrates how Amy finds herself caught between the traditional values of her Muslim family and the image-conscious Western ideals of her peers. In an early scene, we see her trying to straighten her natural Afro hair with a regular household iron after she sees stylish classmate Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni) doing the same thing. Desperate to fit in, Amy begins to dress like a teenager instead of a child and joins Angelica in an all-girl dance troupe called “the Cuties”. Copying the provocative, twerk-heavy routines they see in contemporary music videos, the Cuties are determined to qualify for a big dance contest in central Paris. Their practice sessions and performances are difficult to watch – if they weren’t, Doucouré’s film wouldn’t be such a damning indictment of the premature sexualisation of young girls. Elsewhere, though, the director’s lack of subtlety can slightly undercut her message. One scene features a vague and lazy suggestion that Kim Kardashian might be partly to blame for the Cuties’ misguided aspirations, and Doucouré relies on a few contrived plot developments to bring her film to its ripe climax. Still, there’s no denying she makes her overall point effectively: this is a vivid and very alarming portrait of a young girl struggling to live up to two competing forms of deeply ingrained patriarchy."

"Mar 19, 2021",positive," Maïmouna Doucouré's first feature, drawing on her own experiences as a child, Cuties caused tremendous controversy when it first reached screens. It has since won a César for its star Fathia Youssouf, who was named Best Newcomer. There's no doubt that the subject matter is difficult, dealing with issues around preteen sexuality, but the very fact that we struggle to have necessary conversations around this topic is one of the concerns it addresses, and any danger that it might titillate some adult viewers has to be considered in light of that fact that similar material is available in considerable quantities online - usually without any such challenging demand for empathy with the youngsters it depicts. Youssouf stars as Amy, an 11-year-old girl from a Senegalese community whose strict religious upbringing clashes with the values of mainstream French society. Like any kid that age, she's trying to find her niche in the world and establish ways of expressing herself. Kids at school mock her plain clothing whilst cooing over the Cuties (Mignonnes in the original French, a term which doesn't carry quite the same history of association with pornography), a group of girls into fashion and dance, so naturally she wants to be like them. She's not cool enough, however, so she follows them around, eventually earning a place as a videographer for their routines and subsequently replacing one of their number after a falling-out. Her relationship with the group is troubled and inconsistent, as is often case with female friendships at that age. It is also intense. The idea that they might win a competition together becomes all-consuming. Amy needs a distraction from hr home life, where her mother is struggling to cope with her father's plans to take a second wife. Her grandmother is trying to force her into a traditional role and punishing her for the smallest infractions, but she can see quite clearly that there's no guarantee of such a role making her happy. Other members of the community are more sympathetic but nobody really has time to give her the attention she needs, and the message handed down from female elders is that girls should be kept away from sin by sheltering them from all discussion, all concept of sexual expression or desire. Caught between two differently confusing worlds, Amy pursues her own desires aggressively as if trying to force the mixed messages she receives into some form that makes sense. At no point does she or any of the other girls evince desire for another person. The flirtatious moves they make and they way they dress are a form of play, a means of exploring their potential as they begin to grow up. Only Amy herself shows any awareness of how older men might perceive them, dancing in front of different men on two occasions in an attempt to take control of difficult situations. The film does not depict any abuse of the girls, though - through the reactions of one of these men and, later, of men in a crowd watching the troupe perform at an events - it clearly signals the danger they face. There's a blackly comic aspect to the latter scene, with the girls completely unaware of how horrified most of the people in their audience are. With all this in mind, this could actually be quite a useful film for parents to watch with daughters of a similar age so that they can highlight the dangers which kids all too often fail to recognise without such prompting. There is a call here to recognise uncomfortable realities and to make girls part of the conversation around their own safety rather than simply trying to separate them from the world or deny the fact that they are growing up. With the exception of one of the girls' crush on a boy at school, they live their lives quite separately from their male counterparts. They expect similar freedoms and are all too easily turned into scapegoats for a cultural problem, blamed for causing discomfort when all of the actual danger stems from the behaviour of adults. Doucouré has stressed that the young actresses approached their scenes very much as play and were not somehow sexually corrupted by the dance routines, which simply didn't have the same associations for them as they might for adults. These seems consistent with the naturalness of the performances throughout. Youssouf shines but she is far from the only talent on display here. The complex interactions between the girls are beautifully captured with a recognition of how cruel they can be which is usually missing from such depictions. We see their youth not just in their naivety about sexual matters but also in  their self-centredness and short-sightedness about life in general, made manifest in a (on-sexual) shocking incident near the end in which Amy briefly fears she may have gone too far. We see them very much as people, complicated and difficult, without the soulless innocence that adults find it convenient to imagine. A potent coming of age story with particular relevance to minority ethnic experiences, Cuties is a fresh look at girlhood which deserves to be commended for its bravery. If, for some, it's difficult to watch, it's worth reflecting that it's often difficult to be a girl that age. Doucouré has captured something raw, presenting a reality which ought not to be ignored."
"Jan 9, 2021",positive," In March of 2020, the pandemic lowered the boom on the movie industry, scuttling the release schedule for the remainder of the year with only a few studio movies released. With a few exceptions, the major releases got postponed to 2021 in anticipation of fully vaccinated moviegoers reviving the industry.

With a few exceptions, the major releases got postponed to 2021 in anticipation of fully vaccinated moviegoers reviving the industry. But to paraphrase Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, movies … um, find a way. In 2020, this was mostly due to streaming services, although Christopher Nolan did manage to get a theatrical release for his temporal extravaganza Tenet (earning US$362 million worldwide). It turned out some of the movies released on studio streaming services weren’t worthy of the theatre anyway (Artemis Fowl, Wonder Woman 1984). Still, where there’s a will — or a Netflix account — there’s a way. With that, Free Press movie writers Alison Gillmor, Randall King and Jill Wilson offer up a few of the best of a bad year. In this quiet, unhurried drama, set in a 19th-century fur trading post in the Pacific Northwest, indie director Kelly Reichardt patiently dismantles the ideology of the Hollywood western. A gentle Jewish cook (John Magaro), an enterprising Chinese traveller (Orion Lee) and that titular bovine come together for a minimalist, humanist story that touches on labour and capital, history and national myth, all the while remaining a lovely, low-key buddy picture. From Danish Dogme director Thomas Vinterberg, this deliriously drunken but ultimately sobering comedy-drama tracks a group of middle-aged friends, teachers at a Copenhagen high school, who decide to maintain a consistent blood alcohol level of .05 per cent — in the interests of science, of course. Anchored by the monumentally craggy face of Mads Mikkelsen, this day-drinking comic premise becomes a serious Nordic examination — look out for those Kierkegaard references! — of midlife melancholy, fallibility, friendship and the need for joy. Both passionate and delicate, Celine Sciamma’s breath-stoppingly beautiful period film, set in 18th-century Brittany, centres on a painter (Noemie Merlant) who’s come to make a marriage portrait and her reluctant subject (Adele Haenel). As the two women fall in love, the film becomes a rapturous exploration of the female gaze — behind the camera, on the screen and in the audience. Former Winnipegger Matthew Rankin’s surreal, stylized anti-biopic — named Best Canadian Feature Film at last year’s TIFF — is a fabulist take on our country’s 10th prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King (Dan Bierne). With hallucinatory visuals and deadpan comic timing, Rankin turns history into a fevered Freudian national dream. This made-in-Brazil gem jumps through a few genre possibilities — science fiction, social drama, star-crossed romance — before landing on a large-scale action movie about what happens when foreign hunters come to a Brazilian backwater with evil intent. Written and directed by Juliano Dornelles and Kleber Mendonça Filho, it’s simply a ridiculously entertaining film and its appeal lies in the richness of the village setting. Aaron Sorkin’s dramatization of the titular trial/circus draws a straight line between current events — police brutality, racism, judicial/political corruption — with the 1969 story of how Richard Nixon’s attorney general decided to railroad seven political radicals with charges of conspiracy in vengeful response to the riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. The defendants are hardly a united front, with two in particular — Yippies Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) and Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) — treating the trial as political theatre. They set the stage for Sorkin’s urgent message about seeking unity in these divisive times. A few locally shot films were released in 2020, many in the horror genre, including the backwoods horror movie Hunter Hunter, the urban horror anthology Tales from the Hood 3, and the studio-produced reboot The Grudge, not to mention the Percy Schmeiser biopic Percy (starring Christopher Walken). The best of the local films however was Sean Garrity’s I Propose, mainly because of Garrity’s insistence on giving a fresh take to that most exhausted of genres: the romantic comedy. Putting together a very contemporary relationship movie, Garrity ups the ante by putting the cinematically-neglected Filipino-Canadian community into the mix via heroine Iris DelaCruz (Hera Nalam), who finds herself smitten with troubled Mennonite lad Simon (Kristian Jordan). Nalam is the main reason to see the film. No manic pixie dream girl, she keeps Iris’s emotions grounded, making her entirely relatable, especially in her battles with her disapproving mom. But Nalam has big-time, big-screen charm. (Tonight only, the film will screen free of charge for Manitoba audiences commencing at 6:30 p.m. by logging onto januarysecond.com. Sponsored by SafeAtHomeMB.ca, the screening is part of an effort to keep Manitobans at home during the COVID-19 crisis.) Much as we may love Martin Scorsese, you have to appreciate Italian-made films about the Mafia such as the 2008 film Gomorrah, or Marco Bellocchio’s The Traitor. These films brings an immediacy to the Mob movie, a sense that the Mob is a clear and present danger to those it touches, the innocent and the corrupt. The Traitor is the true story of mobster-turned-informer Tommaso Buscetta (Pierfrancesco Favino), once a soldier for the Sicilian Mob. Brutally convinced to testify against his former confederates, he engages with anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone (Fausto Russo Alesi) and ultimately spills on just about everyone, as we come to understand what drove the fatal wedge between him and his fellow mobsters in the first place. Bellocchio uses the facts of the case to gleefully puncture the myth of Mafiosi dignity. As Buscetta, Favino is a terrific presence, charismatic as past Italian tough guys such as Lino Ventura. If we can thank pearl-clutching reactionaries for anything, it’s for bringing this beautifully wrought coming-of-age film to wider attention. The provocative Netflix PR for Mignonnes (the French title) ignited a firestorm of controversy — including claims of child pornography — over a thoughtful foreign-language art film that would otherwise have been on few viewers’ radar. Starring the wonderfully expressive Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi as a Somali-French preteen who struggles to reconcile her Muslim upbringing with the broad sexuality she sees among her peers and via social media, Cuties is a powerful statement about letting kids be kids. It might be cheating to lump all five of Steve McQueen’s full-length films into one year-end choice, but the thematically linked works, which are oddly designated as a miniseries on Prime Video, really are of a piece, as the British director (Hunger, 12 Years a Slave) explores the world of West Indian immigrants in London from the late ‘60s to the ‘80s. One of the standouts of the quintet is Lovers Rock, an outlier in that it isn’t based on a true story. Instead, it lovingly documents a house party, luxuriating in the details of food, music and romance of a specifically Black experience with a tremendous sense of joy."
"Nov 22, 2020",positive," The tricky line between marketing and exploitation caused a ruckus in the case of Cuties, a wild feature debut from French-Senegalese Maïmouna Doucouré. It won the directing award at Sundance before being snapped up by Netflix. Then a poster happened to it. This was an image cribbed from the film’s most openly provocative sequence – the finale – which, out of context, made everyone see red. It showed four pre-teen girls striking “sexy” poses on a dance stage, wearing shiny crop tops, knee pads and booty shorts. Netflix soon apologised for the poster, and switched to a different image of this quartet pouting to camera, but the damage was done. Doucouré received death threats on social media, and a petition to have the film banned has amassed over 340,000 signatures on change.org. Sight unseen – one can only presume – the originator of the latter Mary-Whitehouse-esque screed calls the film “disgusting”, “dangerous” and made “for the viewing pleasure of paedophiles”. The Turkish broadcasting watchdog RTÜK seems to have agreed, ordering the film’s removal from Netflix in that country. But enough of the moral panic. No one involved in demonising this film has paused at any stage – or watched it – to consider that its very subject is the disturbing, premature sexualisation of young girls in French society. Doucouré is hardly sly with her theme: by the end, she goes all out to make us squirm.  Eleven-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf), a Senegalese Muslim, has recently moved to a Parisian housing estate with her mother (superb Maïmouna Gueye) and two younger brothers. Her father, who we never see, is about to take a second wife, and preparations for the dreaded wedding are underway. At school, a troupe of wannabe dancers called the “mignonnes” (“cuties”) catch Amy’s attention, but she feels too square and shy to fit in – at least until she pilfers a mobile phone from her uncle, and begins using it to take selfies, beautify herself and get tips from hip-hop twerking videos. Doucouré is blatantly pushing buttons here – never more so than in the ever-more-eye-widening dance sequences, where Amy quickly graduates from the rookie in this crew to the one schooling them in risqué, finger-biting choreography. If the pageant finale of Little Miss Sunshine often springs to mind, she functions in the story as Alan Arkin to her own Abigail Breslin.  The other girls want to pass as 14 to attract boyfriends, and with Amy’s phone, they have worrying access to everything the internet can show. Their licentiousness starts to float free of strict plausibility. Amy borrows skimpy T-shirts from her brother, swipes cash and takes them all on shopping sprees. Their make-up budget starts to look enormous. Essentially, they’re aping the gang from Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood, who were 16 going on 25. In letting this play out, Doucouré is underlining an obvious fantasy of pre-pubescence: to fast-forward towards being treated as desirable. The film is more an experiment in chutzpah than a slice of social realism. As the girls mess about recklessly and rehearse their moves, their lack of any supervision is odd, if semi-explained by the distracted chaos of Amy’s household. But they also know how their immaturity gives them a treacherous power, as we see when a security guard tries to hustle them out for trespassing and they brand him as a child molester. These certainly aren’t your neighbourhood’s average polite children. They’re twerking terrors of the pavement. Following some well-received shorts, Doucouré made this from a very personal place. The keenest parts explore the push/pull of her Muslim upbringing. Amy is acting out because of her father’s betrayal, and unwilling to follow her mother – who’s secretly devastated – down the path of demure submission to the patriarchy. Her rebellion is defiantly flaunting herself, and thanks to some brazen invites from the film’s camerawork, the routines she masterminds tend to make the male gaze curl up in horror.  This is powder-keg provocation in an age so terrified of child sexuality. Thanks to the furore, it has blown up just as much in Doucouré’s face. But the film’s first hour is top-notch for a debut. The child performances are electric. The range of emotion she gets from Youssouf – not just the jaw-dropping cosmetic transformations – mark her out as a magician with actors. Gang leader Angelica – quite the failure for nominative determinism, there – is played with almost Larry Clark-esque attitude by Médina El Aidi-Azouni, another brilliant find. How Doucouré achieved her joyous last shot, I don’t quite know. Imperfect as it is, this film deserves to launch a career, not end one."
"Oct 23, 2020",positive," Here, director Maïmouna Doucouré beautifully captures the mercurial, cruel, and confusing terrain of 11-year-old girl groups. Determined to show her mettle, Amy teaches herself how to dance by mimicking the sexuality adult women display in provocative music videos, and then piques the girls' interest by teaching them to twerk and pout. One of the more effective ways to raise awareness about a problematic cultural norm like pornification is to baldly show it, and this is the tactic Doucouré takes in many cringe-inducing scenes of Amy and the girls practicing for and performing in a dance competition. They wear booty shorts and crop tops, twerk, finger their lips, and mimic provocative dance moves popularized in videos like the recently released single by Cardi B., ""WAP."" This is the material that critics of ""Cuties"" denounce, many of whom revile the film without actually having watched it. It is, after all, an easy sell: few want to find themselves on the side of arguing for the sexualization of girls. I encourage readers to reject the false dichotomy of pornification v. purity, and see them as one and the same. Pornification makes compulsory sexual self-display while purity culture over-values virginity and counsels ""modesty"" in girls' and women's dress to protect men from sexual ""sin."" We can instead carve a new path like Amy does in ""Cuties."" The story ends with Amy choosing not to attend her father's wedding (with her mother's permission) and walking out of the dance competition in the middle of their oversexualized routine. In the final scene, we see Amy dressed in jeans, joining in a game of jump rope. We need more feminist stories like ""Cuties"" that illuminate the constraints girls and women face and help us chart a path to full gender equality.  Bernadette Barton is Professor of Sociology and Gender Studies at Morehead State University, and author of the book ""The Pornification of America: How Raunch Culture Is Ruining Our Society"" and ""Stripped: More Stories From Exotic Dancers.""

"Oct 20, 2020",positive," A principios de este mes se estrenaba en Netflix la película 'Guapis', dos semanas después de que la plataforma lanzase como avanzadilla un cartel hecho expresamente para promocionarla en redes. En aquel póster se veía a las protagonistas, un grupo de niñas de 11 años, con poca ropa y poses sugerentes, algo muy diferente al cartel original de la cinta de Maïmouna Doucouré. Y como siempre pasa en Twitter, la polémica no tardó en estallar: que si boicot a Netflix, que si apología de la pedofilia o que si la historia hipersexualiza a niñas. Tal fue el revuelo, que la propia plataforma se vio obligada a pedir disculpas y cambiar tanto el cartel como la sinopsis. Pero amigos, las redes son como son, y 'Guapis' ('Mignonnes en su versión original y 'Cuties' en inglés) ya estaba en el punto de mira de mucha gente varios días antes incluso de que pudiésemos verla. Con este precedente, no es de extrañar que la cinta francesa, que fue premiada a la mejor dirección en el pasado Festival de Sundance y tuvo una **mención especial en la Berninale, se colocase en lo más visto y se haya mantenido en el podio durante tantos días. La película cuenta la historia de Amy, maravillosamente interpretada por la joven Fathia Youssouf, una niña franco-senegalesa y musulmana que, para escapar de la extrema situación familiar que vive (su padre va a casarse con una segunda mujer, su madre se ve obligada a aceptarlo y van a vivir todos juntos), comienza a fijarse en unas compañeras de clase que se van a presentar a un concurso de baile. El resto de niñas visten ropa más atrevida que ella, se exponen en redes sociales y parecen tener la aceptación popular que Amy también busca.  La ópera prima de Maïmouna Doucouré (antes de esta cinta, solo había dirigido un cortometraje) es todo lo contrario al sensacionalismo que nos quisieron vender antes de su estreno. Y la propia directora se ha encargado de aclararlo. Lo ha hecho en el festival de Toronto, afirmando que decidió hacer este filme para mandar un claro mensaje: proteger a los niños. 'Guapis' puede entenderse como una historia de superación, de cómo una niña de solo 11 años intenta dejar de lado los complicados convencionalismos de su familia, centrando su atención en otras cosas. En este caso, en el baile, en la ropa, en el maquillaje y en ese primer vistazo al mundo adulto que ni ella misma entiende cómo funciona. Es una historia preciosa que, al contrario de lo que aquella primera tormenta de tuits ofendidos afirmaba, pone en el punto de mira con muy buen ojo crítico esa sexualización infantil de la que se dijo que presumía. La película plantea varios temas complicados, y los plantea bien. Es una cinta capaz de criticar la represión a las mujeres que hay en muchas religiones y, a la vez, la hipersexualización a la que están sometidas las niñas en la pre-adolescencia, tengan la creencia que tengan. La historia trata a su protagonista con empatía, intentando hacernos entender que Amy es solo una niña buscando su lugar en el mundo mientras el suelo se desmorona bajo sus pies.  En definitiva, 'Guapis' es todo lo contrario a esa primera idea que la plataforma de Reed Hastings vendió el pasado agosto. Es, de hecho, una de las mejores películas que se han estrenado en Netflix durante estos meses."
"Oct 10, 2020",positive,"Cuties is serious and raises useful questions. If it makes you uncomfortable, it's supposed to."
"Oct 8, 2020",positive," Kittens, for this week’s podcast we said “To hell with it,” and jumped into controversy feet first. First, we ease you into things by explaining just why Ryan Murphy’s been getting on our last gay nerve lately. From Feud: Bette and Joan to Scream Queens to The Politician to Hollywood and now with the execrable Ratched dropping (our overtly bitchy review is here), we just can’t keep our gay mouths shut on the matter- said matter being his Gen-X gay obsessions and how badly he tends to explore them. What can we say? We appreciate the guy but he bugs. Then it’s off to the controversy races as we review the much-discussed French film Mignonnes, which dropped on Netflix with the English title Cuties. The controversy surrounding this film exploded in the past few weeks, fueled in part by Netflix’s poor decision to market the film with a shot of its young actors in skimpy dance costumes. We review the film, discuss its controversial aspects from a social, political, and artistic perspective, outline some of the things said about it by its detractors and some of the things said in its defense by its director Maïmouna Doucouré before coming to a conclusion about its worth and its methods. Believe it or not, we have things to say in agreement with both sides of the controversy and come to some conclusions about the film and where it wound up that might surprise you."
"Oct 8, 2020",positive,"Cuties is not a great film, but it is a sensitive and thought-provoking portrait."
"Oct 8, 2020",positive,"Mean Girls without the Tina Fey silliness, or City of God without the violence...there's a lot to think about in this daring, somewhat-edgy slice of social commentary."
"Oct 7, 2020",positive," A few years ago, I watched a movie with my cousin and her family about a serial killer who had a thing for children. The killings were mostly happening off-screen, and a lot of it was ambiguous. As the movie progressed, my niece kept asking questions about the film. Questions like what exactly is happening with ‘that uncle’ and the children or where do they go off to etc. To my utter surprise, my cousin was explaining everything in detail to her in an extremely patient and objective way. After the movie got over, I couldn’t help it and ask, “Was that necessary?”. To that she just said, “Of course it is. She needs to understand and be aware of what is going on.” Cuties is getting a lot of flak for how the protagonists were portrayed and objectified on screen. A lot of it has to do with its unfortunately erroneous marketing campaign. The uneasiness also gets amplified when you realize how young these girls are.  The main character of Cuties is Amy, a Senegalese Muslim, living with her mother and brother in Paris. Her family is waiting in gloom for her father’s impending second wedding while her mother is secretly crumbling, trying to maintain a semblance of outward dignity about the situation. Fascinated by a group of schoolmates who have been practicing privately for a local dance competition, she desperately longs to be part of their gang.  Inspired by the suggestive twerking videos they see online, they misguidedly believe that they should emulate those routines to grab eyeballs and possibly go all the way in the competition. As Amy is slowly succumbing to peer pressure and desperation, she steals a phone to secretly practice the video routines. When the owner catches her with the stolen phone, she takes a compromising picture of herself and posts it online, believing it would get him into trouble. As expected, instead of having the required effect, it makes her a social pariah and gets blocked by not just her friends but also her entire school. All this leads to a mighty explosive climax that shouldn’t be spoiled here. There is a certain innocence in these children when you see them gawking at the school cuties and even with their awkward attempts at flirting with their much older schoolmates as that’s what they believe they should be doing. They also vaguely know what they do might get them into trouble but are so influenced by what they saw online that they think it is acceptable behavior. Maïmouna Doucouré, the director, also makes it pretty clear of that fact. That maybe it WAS the idea, and we are supposed to be uncomfortable at what we are seeing. Not just what they do on screen. But also why and what influenced them to do it.  At one point, the girls ostracize Amy for posting that dirty picture, as they fear they would be labeled sluts if they continue to hang out with her. It does not even occur that somebody might judge them for all they have been doing so far already.  It causes a throwback memory of all those childhood birthday parties, where one kid inevitably dresses up, and how many parents reacts to it. The child may be living the princess dream and having the time of her life. But she doesn’t realize some of the adults around her have already possibly started to judge her. In a stunning sequence that shows her state of mind, her mother and omnipresent, all-knowing matriarchal aunt conducts a purge on her to quash her rebellion. In an ultimate act of defiance, the way her dervish dance morphs into an involuntarily twerking dance routine that she has been practicing so hard is an image that sears into your head and stays there for a very long time.  Médina El Aidi-Azouni playing her sympathetic friend Angelique, the group’s de facto leader, also portrays her character with remarkable aplomb. I also genuinely appreciate the bond Amy shared with her mother, played by Maïmouna Gueye. When they finally come to terms with each other and their decisions, it feels earned and not shoehorned for the climax’s sake. The fact that the movie is making people uneasy is not that surprising. Some scenes in the film genuinely make your skin crawl. But you realize that part of the discomfort you feel watching Cuties also comes from the fact that the kids do not wholly comprehend the consequences their actions may have. It is a movie that needs to be understood and watched, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Oct 7, 2020",positive,"I got the message behind it. This is a movie about coping, pain, the feeling of loneliness and what it pushes us to seek out...but the dubbing was pretty bad, with some of the voices not syncing up well..."

"Oct 2, 2020",positive," Near the end of Cuties, its 11-year-old heroines take the stage at a dance competition with a routine that wouldn't be out of place in a strip club. Clad in sparkly short-shorts and crop tops, they hump the floor, grab their crotches, lick their lips, and throw their heads back in a naive simulation of sex, to the visible discomfort of their audience.  It's possibly the film's most disturbing scene, and for some reason, it's also the scene Netflix chose to highlight in their early marketing, sparking an outcry they should've seen coming from a mile away. (The company has since apologized.) What both the ill-conceived marketing and subsequent controversy are missing, however, is everything about the context.  Yes, it's upsetting, and it's supposed to be — because the whole point of Cuties is how damn hard it can be for girls to navigate womanhood in a society that's all too eager to tell girls and women what they should be, and not at all interested in what they might be or want to be.  Written and directed by Maïma Doucouré, Cuties is the story of Amy (Fathia Youssouf), who's just immigrated to Paris from Senegal with her devout Muslim mother and two younger brothers. While the family waits for Dad to join them, Amy becomes intrigued by a neighbor, Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), whom she (and we) first see from the back, gyrating to music in skintight pants and a belly-baring shirt. It's a mild surprise when she turns around and we see she's Amy's age. Angelica and her friends, the Cuties, come across as cool and worldly to the sheltered Amy, in ways Amy's conservative family would never approve of. Which, of course, is part of the appeal.  On the cusp of adolescence, Amy knows what her religious community expects of her. She also knows it makes her own mother miserable, as seen in one heartbreaking scene when Amy listens to her mom weep between fake-cheery phone calls announcing that Amy's dad has taken a second wife. Amy, hiding under the bed, swallows this secret truth. She learns from her elders that womanhood means obeying a husband, being held to a higher standard of ""decency,"" and cooking and cleaning to satisfy a man who isn't obligated to take her feelings into consideration. These realizations fill Amy with feelings that she doesn't quite understand, but Doucouré does. There's sublimated rage in her fascination with the Cuties, along with simple curiosity and sincere affection. To Amy, her new friends, with their skimpy clothes, showoff-y dance moves, and boy-crazy schemes, represent fun and freedom, even as they present their own hazards, like the head-spinning politics of who's in one minute or out the next. As intricate and intimate as their internal dynamics might be, to everyone else — the cute boys and older girls and mall employees who have the misfortune of crossing their paths — the Cuties are just a pack of undifferentiated wild girls, frequently annoying and occasionally terrifying. Doucouré knows, as any girl who's ever been part of a clique does, that there's power and pleasure in belonging. Even if it's only sometimes. For all the brashness the Cuties project, it quickly becomes apparent that they don't know much more about the way things work than Amy does. All these girls are figuring out how to become women based on the cues they get from the culture around them — strippers twerking in internet videos, older teen dancers taking their tops off, boys checking out girls in low-cut shirts. They absorb and then reflect those lessons back out into society, quickly learning that revealing clothes and seductive moves bring likes and attention. Yet there's a fundamental innocence to their antics, accentuated by the bright, poppy colors that Doucouré uses to frame them. They're kids messing with the dangerous forces of adult sexuality not because they understand it too well, but because they don't. They gyrate to explicit music and then dissolve into a pile of giggles; they send vulgar messages to a boy while shrieking to each other about boobs. In the scene used to market Cuties in France, they buy silky lingerie and then parade down the street wearing it over their clothes in act of playfulness, not titillation. It does get darker sometimes: In one desperate moment, Amy starts undressing to placate an older cousin who's angry with her for stealing his stuff. He stops her, shocked and disgusted, and we're shocked, too. Where did Amy learn to do that? Did she even know what she was offering? But in both horrific scenes and adorable ones, what remains consistent is Doucouré's honesty. She shows these moments as they are, in all their silliness and ugliness, without packaging them in easy moralizing or faux empowerment. Amy's attempts to put on a more grown-up sexuality may be unsettling to watch, but they're also true to a world that bombards girls with the message that, whether they cover up or bare it all, keep their heads down and cook or shake their asses on the dance floor, womanhood is whatever men need it to be. That climactic scene of her writhing on stage isn't about showing Amy as a sexual being, but about taking to task a culture that struggles to see young women any other way. Rather than deny those harsh truths, Cuties gives Amy and her friends the space to experiment within them, no matter how clumsily and misguidedly, and no matter how upsetting we in the audience might find it. By doing so, Doucouré extends to these girls a generosity that, as we've seen in the film, is so often denied them by the rest of the world — the freedom to figure out how they want to navigate it.

"Oct 2, 2020",positive," You may have noticed a bit of heated controversy swirling around Netflix over the last couple of weeks. Specifically, a social media campaign to “cancel” the streaming service because of its decision to carry Cuties (aka Mignonnes), a French film about teenage girls in Paris. Complainers fired off blistering accusations: the film promoted pedophilia, it sexualized underage girls, and it exploited the young actresses who appeared in it. Many shared memes across social media, encouraging others to boycott Netflix for this reason. No one seemed bothered by the fact that they were being asked to do this even though they knew little to nothing about the film. Indeed, people were all-too-eager to boycott Cuties simply based on a stranger’s recommendation. Apparently, there was no need to investigate the claims for themselves. To me, this signifies precisely what’s wrong with America right now. People are willing to jump on any bandwagon of controversy or negativity without having any information about what they’re protesting. As it turns out, the people pushing out the anti-Netflix propaganda were, in many cases, affiliated with the crazy QAnon movement, which purports to be fighting human trafficking. But their aim is ideological: the cult proffers a narrative that claims liberal politicians and Hollywood celebrities are part of a Satanic cabal that kidnaps and sexually exploits children. There is absolutely no proof that any such coterie exists (maybe you heard about Pizzagate). Still, QAnon does seem to be growing in popularity by the day, and most, if not all, of them also happen to be fervent Trump supporters. Netflix responded to the controversy by admitting that their publicity campaign for the film selected promotional imagery that was “inappropriate.” But they stood by their decision to air the film, made by a French Senegalese filmmaker Maïmouna Doucouré. The filmmaker has also stood by her artistic choices, including hiring actresses the same age as their characters; this interview in Slate explores some of the issues she’s been asked to clarify. The film premiered to appreciative audiences as well as critical acclaim at Sundance. The film draws upon Doucouré’s personal experience. She saw a dance competition featuring preteen girls and became fascinated with its attractions to the young. Over the course of a year she interviewed dozens of girls who were enthusiastic participants in this trend. Cuties is the result. As much as it is a sort of exposé of this culture, it is also a fine coming-of-age film about a young girl trying to fit in with her peers. She also has to reckon with family turmoil, given that her love of dance is at odds with her traditional upbringing. Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is introduced as an 11-year-old Senegalese Muslim girl with two younger brothers (one is eight, one an infant) she helps take care of. Her family has recently moved to Paris. Her father has been away for some weeks in Senegal, and when she asks when he’s coming home her mother is vague and says soon. The family observes traditional customs, including having the women cover their hair and wear long dresses. One day Amy overhears her mother on the phone telling a friend that her husband has decided to take a second wife. Her mother feels obligated to call everyone she knows to tell them about this. When she breaks down crying in the middle of one such conversation Amy becomes visibly disturbed and saddened. Not long after this, Amy sees a girl her age, Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), in the laundry room of her apartment building. She is dancing to music on her smartphone — in between waiting for the dryer and ironing her long hair flat. Amy is fascinated and tries ironing her own hair at home. A few days later Amy sees a small group of girls at school and Angelica is among them. They’re dancing, practicing a routine for an upcoming competition. When the girls catch Amy watching them, they accuse her of spying and throw rocks, hitting her in the head. Later, Angelica sees her back at the building and helps her dress the small wound. The two girls slowly become friends, though the other two girls in the dance group not only reject Amy but are mean to her. Amy’s response to the bullying is to try her best to become part of the group. She steals a smartphone left in a delivery van and watches videos so she can practice her dance moves. It takes a while, but when the group rejects another member, Yasmine, for some slight involving another girl’s boyfriend, they accept Amy as a new member to their dance troupe. In addition to listening to pop music on the stolen phone, Amy is also borrowing her little brother’s shirts and turning them into form-fitting tops so she can emulate the style of the girls she wants to befriend. She practices taking selfies and copies the other girls’ efforts to appear older than they are. It might seem unfathomable to adult viewers that Amy should want to be friends with girls who insult and assault her, but anyone who’s been a teenage girl is familiar with the depths of cruelty, aggression, and one-upmanship that characterize many adolescent friendships. Amy also begins to disregard her family’s strict rules in order to spend time with her friends. Eventually, she acts out in ways that shock her mother and elderly aunt. But she is far too obsessed with her newfound activity to care what her family thinks. Amy turns out to not only be a very good dancer, but a natural leader who gets the others’ moves in shape for the competition. But, on the day of the auditions, a family commitment makes her late, and the other girls throw her out of the group. Amy, having had a taste of the attention of her peers, as well as the exhilarating buzz from dancing, goes to desperate measures to get back into the group. Tensions with her family increase, but Amy’s behavior only becomes more reckless and rebellious. The film’s portrayal of adolescent girls is spot on. The young performers perfectly capture the nastiness as well as the fickle changeability of girls whose identity depends on fleeting moments of approval and praise. For those who wonder if the film goes too far in its portrait of the hypersexualized world of teenage dance competitions, the answer is no. The cinematic gaze here simply mirrors the problematic focus of a society that encourages children to speed through their adolescence by imitating the worst of adult behavior. The girls’ explicitly sexual moves are not precocious attempts at seduction. Rather, they are studied imitations of what they learn in online videos; they don’t express an innate urge to appear sensual or sexy. A fascinatingly ironic dichotomy unfolds: a lack of sophistication with regard to social behavior is set against the overtly glamorous looks and poses the girls affect to win the contest, which will increase their “likes” on social media. And that seems to be one of the film’s more salient messages: rather than easy access to porn or the threat of lurking pedophiles, the real problem is the obsessive engagement with social media platforms that encourages attention-seeking behavior, and rewards it. Cuties is a daring and sensitive portrait of a girl whose attempt to break out of her family’s predestined path for her exposes her to things she doesn’t yet understand. It is preteen rebellion of the most ordinary sort, and if we find its trappings a bit shocking, maybe we need to pay closer attention.

"Oct 2, 2020",positive," Most of the polemic involving Cuties, the debut feature of Maimouna Doucouré, is unjustified. It’s just painful to watch. I don’t see a bad intention from the writer/director here, rather seeing the story as an eye-opener for the perils to which susceptible youth is exposed through social media. The pursuit of fame at all cost, cultural differences, estrangement, and insertion in a new community are addressed. Yet, the film gradually loses strength and focus as it moves forward. "
"Sep 22, 2020",positive," Family, community, and peers are all fundamental guides for tweens and have the power to influence their behavior, both for better and worse. Popular images that are widely available online sexualize young girls, perhaps especially young girls of color, and can influence how they see themselves and behave. Acceptance and belonging are powerful motivators. Immigrant families try to maintain their traditions as they, and especially their kids, assimilate into a new culture. Friend groups can be diverse. Amy and Angie have a supportive friendship despite being surrounded by culture of bullying and girls being mean to each other (a culture they both participate in at times). As she tries to fit in with a new friend group, Amy makes some inappropriate and potentially dangerous moves, crosses ethical lines by lying and stealing. Amy's mother relies on a very traditional ""auntie"" to help educate her daughter, even as she struggles with her own problems, namely her husband taking on a second wife. Her culture teaches her to obey her husband, but she does have the option of leaving him. School administrators break up fights in the recess yard; one pushes middle schoolers toward her office. Before they become friends, the girl group bullies Amy, pushing her around, grabbing and emptying her backpack, making fun of how she looks. Amy gets in her own fight later, attacking another girl who gets Amy to the ground, pulls down her pants, and photographs her underwear to share on social media. Amy later pushes a girl into a river; it appears the girl doesn't know how to swim, but she manages to paddle to a buoy. A girl overhears a conversation about rape. Girls accuse a security guard of ""groping"" them, calling him a ""pedophile"" to get out of trouble. Tween girls pose and dance in suggestive ways, mimicking dances they watch online. They dress in skimpy clothes and heels, though Amy has been told at a religious gathering that ""evil"" shows itself in ""scantily clad women."" Amy overhears other girls having a conversation about sex (and rape), which is explicit yet shows some serious misconceptions about specifics. The girls push Amy into the boys' bathroom to try to film a male classmate, and flirt with one boy online, offering to let him touch a ""boob."" Coumba finds what she thinks is a balloon on the ground in a park and blows it up, but it turns out to be a condom; the other girls are disgusted by her contact with it, try to wash her body and mouth off with soap. Amy starts to undress for a man when he realizes she stole his phone, presumably offering her body in exchange for the phone. To try to compensate for the embarrassment of having her underpants photographed and shared publicly, Amy posts a photo of her private parts on social media; a classmate calls her a ""slut"" because of it. Amy's friends get angry with her because other classmates later ask them to do the same. Amy's father is about to remarry and sets up a special honeymoon suite. Parents need to know that Cuties is a controversial French film (with English subtitles in the United States) that takes on the difficult topic of how young girls are influenced by society's sexualizing of women in a way that teens can learn from. That said, the movie's unflinchingly candid treatment of its subject could turn off some viewers and leave others feeling sad or even anxious. The tween girl characters' suggestive dance moves are filmed up close, and they dress in skimpy clothes and talk about sex and rape -- albeit with some misconceptions that reveal their actual innocence, as does a scene where one girl plays with a condom from the ground in a park without knowing what it is. The lead character, Amy (Fathia Youssouf), will do just about anything to fit in. She's pushed into a boys' bathroom to try to film a classmate peeing, and her girlfriends flirt with boys online, offering to let one touch a ""boob."" To try to compensate for the embarrassment of having her underpants photographed and shared publicly after losing a fight, Amy posts a photo of her private parts on social media. Her friends tell her she went too far, and a classmate calls her a ""slut."" She starts to undress for a grown man, presumably in exchange for his phone, which he caught her stealing. The girls sometimes put themselves in potential danger, but the film ends on a cautiously optimistic note. It also offers a glimpse into the lives of Senegalese and other immigrant communities living in housing blocks in Paris. Language includes ""hell,"" ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""loser,"" ""stupid,"" ""bitches,"" ""f--k,"" ""damn,"" ""boobs,"" and ""slut.""

She's just moved into a new apartment in Paris with her mom (Maïmouna Gueye) and two brothers. They're awaiting the arrival of Amy's father -- and, it turns out, his soon-to-be second wife. When Amy sees a neighbor girl her age, Angie (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), dancing suggestively in the apartment building laundry room, Amy is intrigued by how different Angie's life seems to be from her own. Amy starts spying on Angie's group of friends, which goes by the name ""the Cuties,"" as they get in trouble at school and practice a sexy dance routine in an abandoned area after school. Amy and Angie become friends, and Amy slowly joins the group. She learns the girls' dance routine for an upcoming competition and adds new and even racier moves based on videos she finds online. Slowly, Amy begins adapting new manners and styles to fit in, all of which she tries out on social media. But it seems that the closer she gets with the girls, the farther she feels removed from her traditional upbringing and community. Her father's upcoming wedding and the dress he sent her for the occasion are symbolic reminders of how much things are changing in Amy's life. When Amy takes things a step too far, she finds herself on the outside of her family, her community, and her new friend group, and she'll have to figure out what her path forward will be. Senegalese-French director Maïmouna Doucouré has created an evocative, compassionate portrait of young girls finding their identity and values in this controversial film. In the hands of a less capable director, Cuties could easily have felt exploitative of its child actors, something the film was accused of in an initial (and controversial) marketing campaign in the United States. Doucouré films the girls close up as they move their bodies in a sensual way and strike suggestive poses in halter tops, short-shorts, and excessive makeup. But she offers these scenes precisely in order to shock, because they should be shocking. The public's reaction to the girls' final performance in the film reveals as much. The subtlety is in the way Doucouré captures the young girls' innocence. Despite their poses, they're not exactly informed about sex. They regularly collapse into piles of giggles. Amy isn't truly trying to provoke; she just wants to fit in. That's where the context comes in: It's set in the multicultural Parisian exurbs, where Doucouré offers intriguing glimpses into the role of women in the Senegalese community. Amy is torn between the traditional values she's being taught at home and the draw of her new friends and culture. This feels both typical and an exceptionally perceptive portrayal of the plight of adolescence and the immigrant experience bundled into one. Some images will stick with you long after this film: Amy's symbolic wedding dress, her father's new bride shrouded in white, the girls' poses, and a beautiful closing scene of Amy bouncing back, literally, into her community and her childhood. Families can talk about the role of the internet and social media in Cuties. Without these, do you think the girls would have the same ideas about sexuality or the same impulses to share intimate photos of themselves? Why, or why not? What are the dangers of sexting?

"Sep 22, 2020",positive,"  Take a seat. Better yet, make a nice, hot cup of tea, pull up your nearest fainting couch, and get ready for some information that is sure to blow your mind. Ready? Americans are really, really stupid when it comes to both art and nuance. An example is the kerfuffle that sprang up regarding The Last Temptation of Christ. It all began with the 1955 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis that examined the life of Jesus. Specifically, it posited the concept of Jesus briefly succumbing to temptation while on the cross and imagining a normal life. One that involved sex, love, and a family. As you might imagine, a certain stripe of Christian was very angry with the book. This anger turned to incandescent rage in 1988, when Martin Scorsese adapted the novel into an excellent film. Now, you would think people who were taught the Gospels, to live with a love for others, to turn the other cheek, you would think those folks would either try to see the spiritual message inherent in Last Temptation* or love the people they disagreed with in brotherhood. Nope! Thousands of people called for the film to be banned. Television evangelists denounced Scorsese. In fact, Scorsese received numerous death threats which, unless I missed big chunks of the Bible, is antithetical to the message of Christianity. There was even an attempted terrorist attack on a theater in Paris. A group of radical Catholics (Yes, seriously) set off an incendiary device that wounded thirteen people. So based on the preceding paragraphs, I must think that conservative Christians are a bunch of gullible nitwits, right? Well…no. As much as I’d like to take a moment to clown on the right-wing outrage machine, the fact remains that both liberals and conservatives tend to live in a black and white space when it comes to artistic expression, and that space is not where nuance lives. Don’t believe me? Let’s talk about the new film Cuties, and why the controversy around it is mostly nonsense. Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is eleven, and she has just moved from Senegal to a neighborhood in Paris. Things are very different for her. She’s in a new place with new customs and new faces, and she’s expected to help care for her two younger brothers. What about her parents, you might ask? That’s where things start to become complicated. Her mother Mariam (Maimouna Gueye) is already struggling to keep the children stable in their new home. Mariam tries to live as a righteous Muslim woman and feels pressure from her Aunt (Mbissine Therese Diop) to do better. The pressure gets worse when she receives a phone call from Senegal and the news that her husband has taken a second wife. This is all an enormous amount for Amy to process. She needs support, and unfortunately, Mariam doesn’t have the bandwidth to provide it. So, she seeks out a support system elsewhere, and boy howdy, does she find it. A pilfered smartphone introduces her to social media and the endorphin rush that comes from likes and comments. A chance encounter at school pinballs Amy’s life in a radically new direction. She meets the Cuties, a group of girls in her grade. They are her neighbor Angelica (Medina El Aidi), the snarky Coumba (Esther Gohourou), and the combative Jess (Ilanah Cami-Goursolas). The Cuties move through the world with the kind of bulletproof self-confidence that only exists within tweens and rich, white men. Their goal is to enter and win a dance competition, one that emphasizes barely-there costumes and dance moves that are…well, let’s go with “suggestive.” The realization hits Amy like a thunderbolt. The Cuties are everything she isn’t and like nothing she’s ever seen before. At least, that’s what she thinks. How to get in with the cool girls? Proving yet again that the internet was a mistake, Amy dives online and immerses herself in videos. Her plan is to imitate the moves of dancers much older and copy their routines, routines that are wildly age-inappropriate. They don’t just push the envelope, they rip through the damn thing. It’s all in service of social medial likes, realizing a vague dream, and learning that actions have consequences. A number of prominent individuals have accused Cuties of either being child pornography or sexually exploitative. Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley railed against the film. An op-ed in the conservative website The National Review wrote, “Thus, whatever their artistic intentions, in making a social commentary about the sexualization of children, the filmmakers undeniably sexualized children.” Christine Pelosi, daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeted, “Cuties hypersexualizes girls my daughter’s age, no doubt to the delight of pedophiles like the ones I prosecuted. Cancel this, apologize, work with experts to heal your harm.” It was all outrage, but it never came from a place rooted in liberal or conservative ideology. It was only reactionary. By now, I imagine you’re probably thinking, “Don’t keep us in suspense, is Cuties offensive trash that comes straight from the Second Circle of Hell?” No, but it is designed to make viewers feel uneasy. Director Maimouna Doucoure has made a clear-eyed and nuanced film about the raging desire of a child to fit in, and the poor decisions they can make that blow up in their faces. She knows exactly what kind of film she’s making; one about perspectives. When the girls practice their routines, we hear pulsing pop music as they emulate what they have seen elsewhere. I’m not sure they’re fully aware of the meaning of these suggestive dance moves, but they know on a subconscious level that they have raw power. However, watch the same routine later when adults observe. You’ll see some skeezy guys who are into it, but far more adults who are repelled and appalled. In the end, the gaze of the camera is entirely dependent upon context. There are also tiny moments of surrealism that pop in and out, such as a dress that Amy is given to wear at her father’s wedding. Watch how the shape and color of the dress slightly changes depending on Amy’s mood. It’s filmmaking that’s smart and subtle. Doucoure based her screenplay on her own experiences as a refugee, as well as eighteen months of research regarding how social media influences the behavior of children and young teens. More relevant is her prior experience as a girl. The script is a coming of age tale in which Amy bounces between the expectations of her culture and religion to be a submissive wife, an onslaught of online images lacking in context, and the age-old growing pains we all go through. She ultimately wants to find her people and her place in the world while simultaneously wanting to rebel against the world she’s growing up in. The tragedy is that she makes decisions from the perspective of a child and is judged as an adult. I think I was most impressed by the natural and honest performances that Doucoure was able to draw out of her cast.*** The younger actors do solid work, and I was particularly impressed with Fathia Youssouf as Amy. She’s asked to do some extremely heavy lifting from an emotional standpoint, and whether she’s about to break from pressure or giggling as she crams gummy worms into her mouth, she always feels believable. The stealth MVP of the cast is Maimouna Gueye as her mother Miriam. She has an astounding scene where she takes a phone call and learns of her husband’s decision to take another wife. Gueye’s tone of voice is all business on the phone. We can only see her feet as she hangs up the phone. For a moment there’s only silence, then we see her feet shaking as she sobs. You’ve probably heard a variation of the old saying that depiction doesn’t equal endorsement. Odds are that the vast majority of people hysterically shrieking over Cuties either haven’t seen the film or are reading it in the most shallow manner possible. Cuties made me extremely uncomfortable. Since it’s a critique of society’s rampant sexualization of children, it’s supposed to.**** Maimouna Doucore’s film is intelligent and nuanced, and I fervently hope that her next project is viewed with more open-mindedness. Odds are, it won’t be. *Whether you agree with the central message of the film or not, consider that the central message is that initially Jesus profoundly does not want to take the suffering of the world entirely within himself. He wants what everyone else wants, but decides to sacrifice himself anyway.

"Sep 21, 2020",positive," s curioso y a la vez un tanto revelador que una pequeña película francesa distribuida por la plataforma Netflix suscite hoy cierta polémica en medios tradicionalistas estadunidenses por su tratamiento inusual de la sensualidad preadolescente femenina. Es posible que el motivo real de inquietud no sea precisamente la manera desenfadada y gráfica en que en una cinta comercial un grupo de niñas púberes expresan, mediante el baile, la relación muy libre con sus cuerpos y la búsqueda de una identidad propia, sino el hecho de que las protagonistas pertenezcan, casi todas, a minorías étnicas desfavorecidas, y que su conducta suponga un desafío al espacio social que se les reserva en Francia, un país pretendidamente defensor de todas sus libertades. Guapis (Mignonnes, 2020; Cuties, título en inglés), primer largometraje de la franco-senegalesa Maïmouna Doucouré, relata la historia de la estudiante de 11 años Amina (formidable Fathia Youssouf), quien pacientemente soporta las imposiciones morales de su familia musulmana en un medio social francés, donde una vieja tradición hermética se ve obligada a lidiar con los estilos de vida mucho más liberales de la diversidad cultural. Este conflicto lo vive la joven Amy en un desasiego continuo que se traduce en timidez y baja autoestima. Esa sensación se agudiza al descubrir que su madre padece a su vez el abandono de su esposo, quien ha partido a Senegal en busca de una segunda esposa, a quien luego habrá de incorporar al domicilio conyugal, en obediencia a una tradición que autoriza la poligamia. Esa situación que vive la madre con frustración y angustia es sólo un dramático preludio de lo que la suerte le depara a la joven en su eventual ingreso a la edad adulta. Las mujeres que rodean a Amy le recuerdan que toda mujer debe ser siempre modesta, obedecer sin protestar a su marido y agradar en todo a su madre. A lo largo de todo su relato, la película Guapis procede a cuestionar ese entramado de imperativos patriarcales. La paulatina emancipación moral de Amy se produce de forma novedosa y, para algunos, perturbador. Un grupo de condiscípulas rebeldes, autodenominadas Mignonnes (guapis), la admiten a regañadientes en sus planes para participar en un concurso de baile. A partir de modelos promovidos en las redes sociales, e ingenuamente imitados por las inquietas preadolescentes, el baile se vuelve una expresión corporal y una coreografía sensual que practicada y exhibida por menores casi niñas, flirtea peligrosamente con las conductas lascivas. Resulta claro que la directora no reivindica de modo alguno el comportamiento que tanto indigna a los detractores de la cinta, y que, por el contrario, muestra, sin rodeos, los efectos tóxicos de una cultura audiovisual que impone a esas menores algunos patrones de sensualidad tan seductores como confusos. En el caso de Amy y sus amigas, la imitación ciega de esos modelos choca de frente con los valores tradicionales de sus comunidades de origen, suscitando un escándalo público todavía mayor. En el contexto de una Francia multicultural, con gran diversidad étnica, el caso de Amy es particularmente emblemático. A sus 11 años vive ya el drama de verse caracterizada por su propia familia como una joven poseída por fuerzas malignas y por lo mismo candidata a todo tipo de exorcismos, mientras se siente a su vez solidaria con la madre víctima de adulterios comunitariamente permitidos. Una de las escenas más intensas la muestra escondida bajo una cama, llorando en silencio al escuchar los agravios que soporta su progenitora. La película transita de la comedia al drama con un ritmo atractivo y muy ágil, encaminado todo al momento culminante de la presentación en público del baile controvertido. Pero eso es sólo anécdota y pretexto para lo que verdaderamente importa a la realizadora y que consiste en referir el proceso de la púber Amy para arribar a una madurez moral y sobre todo conquistar una identidad propia. La cinta habría ganado mucho desplegando un fresco social más amplio sin detenerse demasiado en las peripecias genéricas de una comedia juvenil. Pero ese es un reparo mínimo y subjetivo que poco afecta a un relato fascinante en el que destacan dos actuaciones soberbias: Fathia Youssouf en el papel de Amy y Maïmouna Guey personificando de modo camaleónico a su madre. Guapis/Cuties obtuvo el premio a la mejor dirección en el Festival de Cine de Sundance."
"Sep 19, 2020",negative," If paedophilia wasn't a parent's most dreaded fear, Netflix coming-of-age tale Cuties, a controversial French film that takes on the difficult subject of how young girls are impacted by societies' sexualising of women in a way teens learn from, would have made the audience more receptive to the movie's unflinchingly candid treatment of its subject. The movie, which has whipped up a frenzy of fury from the public for sexualising little girls, focuses on an 11-year-old who is raised in a traditional Senegalese Muslim household, later finding herself torn between traditional family values and today's internet culture which does not bat an eyelid when it comes to the hyper-sexualisation of young women. The doll-faced preteen character is Amy. Her growing femininity plus dysfunctional family environment exacerbates her rebellious streak as she embarks on the tumultuous journey of becoming a teen. While reserved, she desires to take her developing interest in pop music and dance, and a deep-rooted need to feel like she belongs, to the next level by joining a dance crew her age called Cuties: a budding troupe whose leader also resides where her family lives. The girls first meet in the laundry room where the long-haired spectacled dancer can be seen practising her steps while waiting for her clothes to get washed, unaware of Amy watching her intensely from behind. The intrigue for the outwardly awkward Amy is understandable when the dance crew and she come face to face. Their personalities clash: where Amy is shy, they are bold, where she is modest, they're brash and in your face. The fickle-minded affections of prepubescent girls are at play as we watch how the girls move from their extreme adoration for each other to their dreadful ability to bully Amy at the drop of a hat. Stealing a mobile phone on a whim, she uses this to wiggle her way into the group by becoming their videographer for their dancing escapades as the girls prepare to vie for a place in a dance contest. It is here they meet their much older rivals, who are more physically developed and needless to say sexualised in their moves. Amy and her crew seem oblivious to the fact that they are at the mercy of a hyper-sexualised culture and its pressures. Soon enough, we see the Cuties are unfurling their own fresh routine helmed by Amy, who while seeming to remain tuned in to what is unfolding around her has no inkling into what it actually means. It is here I find the storyline becomes murky as it sexualises the girls in a manner that would pander to the desires of a paedophile. The characters' suggestive dance moves are filmed up close, while their skimpy attire and talk about sex and rape bring more disgust to the viewer than an actual understanding of their misconceptions that reveal their innocence. Technically this raw unfiltered film strings together a plot that really does not make sense. To begin with, none of the characters' names are directly given and characters are often introduced and/or tossed out randomly breaking any momentum they might have formed in the audience's mind. There are also moments where it is unclear what anybody is talking about to bring you to the assumption that a particular incident is about to happen. Putting things in perspective, I feel that we reside in a world where women and children are subjected to all sorts of cruelty -- rape, slavery, prostitution -- making it all the more obvious that in no context is it permissible to watch the hyper-sexualisation of children. All this does is give an excuse for perpetrators to feel justified to defile a child. Maybe, say, because they were aroused by watching little girls gyrate to loud music in skimpy clothes … is anyone's guess."
"Sep 18, 2020",negative,The film becomes what it tries to defeat [Full Review in Spanish]
"Sep 18, 2020",negative," If you’ve heard of Cuties on Netflix, then I’m sure you’ve heard about the Cuties controversy – it sexualizes children, it’s a pedophile’s dream, cancel Netflix. As an ex-CPS worker, I’m sensitive to the over-sexualization of children, so I’m wondering why TikTok is still a thing, but that’s another discussion. After watching Cuties, I disagree with Netflix’s marketing of the film, because they missed the point of the film, but I also have to question whether people who are mad have watched the film. Should kids watch Cuties? That’s a big no from me. But should adults watch it? Here’s what parents need to know in this Cuties Parents Guide. When I first watched the trailer of Cuties, I could feel my blood pressure rise and my disdain grow. My first impressions watching young girls twerking were that they were being exploited. Then I started to see reactions from people on Twitter who had seen the movie at Sundance and comment that this wasn’t the movie they watched. So I had to see for myself. From director Maïmouna Doucouré, a French-Senegalese film director, Cuties is about eleven-year-old Amy who lives with her mom and younger brother, awaiting her father to rejoin the family from Senegal. Amy is fascinated by her wild neighbor Angelica’s “free-spirited” dance clique named “Cuties”, a group that is a sharp contrast to how she was raised in dress, attitude, and behavior. Even after they bully her, Amy wants to be accepted and convinces them to use even more provocative dance moves for a local dance competition.  Those dance moves are what has caused the outrage, but that’s not even the worst of it. Cuties is rated TV-MA for language, sexual content, and truthfully, it’s disturbing to watch. Is Cuties ok for kids? Here’s what parents should know before they let their children watch Cuties. I watched in French with English subtitles, so you can either read the language or switch the audio to English. But there is a lot of profanity like bit–, fu–, a–, bullsh–, slut, whore, etc. Here’s where Cuties is not appropriate for young children. There is very suggestive and sexualized dancing where 11-year-olds are twerking, essentially humping the ground, making provocative faces with their fingers in their mouths, slapping themselves and each other on the butts, and more.  However, in other situations, one girl takes a picture down her pants to post on social media. You don’t see her actual body part. In a music video the girls are watching on a computer, a high school girl pulls down her shirt to expose her boob. In another scene, the girls dare a girl to record a boy in the bathroom peeing in a urinal and she does it. Though you don’t see past the wall. The girls make references to rape. One girl finds what she perceives to be a balloon, but it’s a condom, and she blows it up, then the girls scream and tell her she probably has AIDS. The girls also discuss oral sex. Another scene shows a girl stab a boy in the hand hard with a pencil. And a girl pushes another girl into water and the girl can’t swim, almost causing her to drown. A parent slaps a girl. There are situations of bullying and calling people names. One character throws a rock and hits a girl in the head causing her to bleed. As a parent, I get the message that the director is making, and I think it’s an important one. Doucouré said, “My one message would be that childhood is precious and we all have to protect our children,” she told Shadow and Act. “We all have to come together to figure out what is best for our children so that we can give a beautiful space to our children to grow up safely and peacefully, so that they can have the freedom to choose who they want to become and the best version of themselves.” However, in this film she didn’t protect the actors that had to portray these scenes. They’re horrible and disgusting to watch. I felt sick to my stomach. I don’t want to have to google to try to find out if the actress who exposed herself is over 18 or if I’ve just been a witness to child pornography. For the greater good, do we need to exploit the children in the film? As a critic, I’m mad that she spoon-fed these scenes to the audience. Maybe it was shock value or to have people pay attention, but you don’t have to make scenes so paint-by-number to get the point across. Let the audience get what they want from the images you’re portraying.  And they really didn’t need to be so graphic to be impactful. Plus, the movie itself is boring. Aside from the shock value scenes, it’s a long, slow build to the ending scene, which was beautiful, but not worth the wait. Once again the end scene left little to the imagination. Parents, if you’re outraged by the trailer, then watch the film. Get even more outraged at what’s going on in society. Even if you don’t agree with the methods, what’s going on in society for these young girls is happening. Those same disgusting dance moves? Your 11-year-old girls are doing them on TikTok. I know, because they’re friends with my kids, and follow me, and I’ve seen some of them.  We’re allowing society and friends tell these impressional young girls that your worth is based on likes and the more sexual you are, the more you’ll be accepted. That being said, no adults or even peers condoned the behavior outside of the Cuties group. That is one thing I appreciated about the film. Even some older boys were disgusted that such young girls were trying to act like they were older. Netflix was wrong in the way they marketed this film. Do I think Cuties was made for pedophiles? No. I think it was made for parents and society, but in an erroneous way that missed the mark. Let the Cuties controversy be a wake up call to parents. Fix what’s in front of you first. Pay attention to what’s happening to your own kids and start with your own home. And the rest of the world, let’s change the culture and pressures we put on these tweens."
"Sep 17, 2020",negative," The world is a confusing place right now. We believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs. Do you believe that too? Help TGC bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work. One of the most disturbing things about Netflix’s Cuties is that many ostensibly sophisticated, “cultured” people seem bent on defending and redeeming what is, in the end, an irredeemably problematic film. I’ve watched Cuties (reluctantly), and it’s true the film is attempting to critique rather than to celebrate the exploitative sexualizing of young girls. But by doing the very thing it critiques—repeatedly, gratuitously, horrifyingly—it undermines its point and dangerously justifies, in the name of thoughtful art, something that cannot be justified. The film’s defenders will respond with various “what abouts.” What about the fact that the real villain is Netflix’s marketing department? That might be a valid defense, except that the image on the promotional poster comes from an actual scene in the film—an extended scene of lewd, sexualized, pre-teen dancing far more disturbing than the poster itself. What about the fact that it’s a well-made, personal story by a talented filmmaker—“a sensitive portrait of female adolescence by a gifted woman of color,” as Rolling Stone put it? Nope, sorry. Even if the film was a magnum opus directed by Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, or Terrence Malick (some of my favorite directors), we’d still need to draw a line and reject it. An auteur’s freedom of vision and claims to “artistic expression” should have moral limits. Sexualizing real, image-bearing, precious girls (age 11!) to make a point is a limit that should be uncontroversial. An auteur’s freedom of vision and claims to ‘artistic expression’ should have moral limits. Sexualizing real, image-bearing, precious girls (age 11!) to make a point is a limit that should be uncontroversial. What about the suggestion that this is just an election-year pseudo-event fueled by right-wing QAnon fanatics? Also no. I think QAnon is a dangerous political cult, and I arrived at my assessment of Cuties without reading anything written by any conspiracy-theory carnival barker. It’s quite revealing that many in the media have assumed a bizarre QAnon sex-trafficking theory is behind the outrage about Cuties—rather than just basic moral concern over sexualizing underage girls. Our bubbles can be so blinding. The fault lines on Cuties were quick to develop—bafflingly—along partisan lines. I could predict what people in my social-media feeds would say about the film based on their politics. Those leaning right (and certainly not just the QAnon fringe) signed petitions to #CancelNetflix. Those leaning left defended the film or dismissed the boycott conversation as a silly outrage in the culture wars. How disturbing. Just as wearing masks during a pandemic should not be a matter of partisan debate, neither should condemning a film that recklessly sexualizes children. This shouldn’t be so hard. People on every point on the political spectrum should be able to say it is wrong for a film—any film, however well-intentioned—to depict close-up, lingering shots of scantily clad 11-year-olds twerking. It’s refreshing that some leaders on the left have recognized this as the nonpartisan issue it should be, like Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, or Nancy Pelosi’s daughter Christine. But they are the exception, not the norm. We’ve been so blinded by confirmation bias and negative partisanship—driven more by ‘owning’ the other side than by actual positive convictions—that we’re willing to justify something heinous because we don’t like the people calling it heinous. It seems we’ve been so blinded by confirmation bias and negative partisanship—driven more by “owning” the other side than by actual positive convictions—that we’re willing to justify something heinous because we don’t like the people calling it heinous. Of course this problem goes beyond the Cuties controversy and plagues conservatives too, who are often quick to defend their favored politician’s morally dubious behavior against the “unfair” attacks of the other side. For Christians especially, it’s crucial we call foul on what is morally depraved wherever we find it—even if in our own camp. Fans of Maïmouna Doucouré should be able to say, “She’s talented, and I get what she’s trying to do, but I can’t condone this,” just as fans of President Trump should be able to say, “I like his stance on this issue, but he’s absolutely wrong in the way he argues his case.” A right message can be delivered in a wrong way. People on both sides of the political divide should be willing to admit this point. There are certainly times when transgressive and shocking content in art serves a purpose. Movies especially, with their ability to mimic realism so viscerally, can pack an indelible punch in this way. A movie like Schindler’s List is memorable in part because it refuses to soften the visual, embodied atrocities of the Holocaust. Spielberg’s film makes a point cinematically that couldn’t be made in exactly the same way in a book or a poem. But transgressive content in a film must be handled with utmost care—because the line between “shocking to make a point” and “shocking for its own sake” is often contested and arbitrary. Further, when a film’s transgressive material is sexual in nature, the ethical lines are especially blurry. In order to present such material, real, embodied people are necessarily objectified and sexualized before cameras, directors, film crews, and ultimately audiences. It’s one thing to defend this when the actors are adults (but after #MeToo, the ethics of even this are being questioned). But when the actors are underage—again, only 11 years old—it’s another thing entirely. If one only reflects on the amount of practice these 11-year-old girls had to do in order to master dance moves simulating rough sex, the wretchedness of the whole enterprise becomes apparent. An actor must become proficient in martial arts before starring in a martial arts film. In Cuties, these young actors had to become proficient in their own sexual commodification. Again, the problem is not that Doucouré’s point—that the degrading and dehumanizing of women’s bodies is wrong, whether it happens in a restrictive Muslim context or a libertine Western one—is off-base or unimportant. The problem is the means to this end. Don’t watch Cuties. We don’t need to watch young girls gyrating on the floor and twerking on staircases to be aware of how mass media conditions young women to see themselves and their bodies. An article, essay, book (consider American Girls), or any number of daily headlines make us aware. If you live in proximity to kids in this world, you are aware. Filming real young girls doing the very things we want to prevent young girls from doing is not the answer. As my friend Kevin Yi observed on Facebook, if this was a movie about the evils of dog fighting, and the filmmakers staged a bunch of real dog fights to get their point across, everyone would see the wrongness of the strategy. The Babylon Bee made a similar point.  Speaking of Cuties, director Doucouré observed: “Our girls see that the more a woman is overly sexualized on social media, the more she’s successful. And the children just imitate what they see. . . . It’s dangerous.” Quite right. The problem is, many of the same “feminist” defenders of Cuties—who would nod along with Doucouré’s “children just imitate what they see” comment—also find J.Lo’s Super Bowl pole dancing praiseworthy, not problematic. You can’t hold up globally televised sexualized dancing as a celebration of empowered women and Latino culture and, at the same time, lament that 11-year-old girls in Paris want to imitate that behavior. Which is it? If we praise scantily clad, sexualized pop stars like Beyoncé, Shakira, or Cardi B as feminist icons and “empowered” role models for young girls, we should neither complain, nor be surprised, when pre-adolescent girls acts this way too (as in Cuties). The #MeToo movement supposedly sparked a difficult “soul-searching” reckoning for Hollywood—which has always been one of the chief purveyors of sexualized bodies as cheap goods for widespread consumption. But the fact that Cuties was made, celebrated at the Sundance Film Festival, and distributed on Netflix shows there’s still a lot more soul-searching to do. The same goes for Christians. New Pew research sadly shows that many Christians are only slightly less confused than non-Christians on sexual ethics. So even as we rightly denounce a film like Cuties, we should also double down on fighting pornography addiction, sexual abuse, and other immorality within our midst. The force of the sexual revolution has not left the church unscathed, after all. We must press in to the challenges of discipleship on matters of sexuality, defending the goodness of sex in its rightful, covenantal place, all while protecting the vulnerable—especially children—from the tragic consequences of sex outside of that sacred context.

"Sep 17, 2020",positive," The sexualisation of children has to be one of the most difficult topics to explore in cinema given the importance to neither downplay the issue nor sensationalise it, in order to treat the subject matter with the sensitivity it requires. Given these inherent difficulties, Maïmouna Doucour’s coming-of-age debut feature film Cuties is all the more impressive for how well it navigates the experiences of 11-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf) who is drawn to a clique of girls at her new school who aspire to dance competitively. Torn between her the ultra-conservative values of her family’s religion and the hyper-sexualised popular culture she and her peers consume online, Amy’s sense of identity is increasingly assaulted as the result of trying to navigate the mixed and often contradictory messages she absorbs about how to behave and her value as a young woman. Having recently moved into a small apartment in the suburbs of Paris with her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) and younger brothers, Amy is becoming aware that there is something rotten about the difference in status between men and women. This manifests both in small ways – she has to wear a head scarf and attend religious instruction while her younger brother is allowed to play – and in larger ways, as she witnesses the grief and turmoil her mother endures at having to accept Amy’s father will soon return from Senegal with a second wife. To make matters worse, the community elder La tante (Mbissine Thérèse Diop), informs Amy that part of her becoming a woman is learning to cook in preparation for the wedding. The oppressive patriarchy of her family’s adherence to a repressive religion is one of subservience for women who are reduced to commodities and expected to gladly accept their lower status. There is little wonder Amy yearns to rebel. However, at this young and impressionable age, she is also being taught that her happiness will be dependent on male approval, and this toxic belief hijacks her rebellion. Enter the Cuties, the dance group of similarly aged girls from school who are led by Amy’s defiant neighbour Angelica (Medina El Aidi). Drawn to the hyper sexualised dance routines and costumes in music video clips, the Cuties aspire to channel a similar energy into their own sense of selves and adopt the provocative moves into their own routines with the goal of entering an upcoming competition. Amy is soon accepted into the group and she too begins to embody the highly uncomfortable blurring of boundaries between childhood and adulthood in terms of the age-inappropriate performance of sexual desire. So much of Cuties is uncomfortable as despite all the bravado on display, there is never any doubt that the girls are just kids. Cuties continually creates jarring clashes between the sexualised nature of their performed adult behaviour and just how childish they are the moment they let their guard down. As their routines get increasingly sexual, the film draws attention to how ridiculous and contrived their moves are, showing the girls awkwardly trying to replicate the moves and expressions they’ve seen in video clips despite having little understanding of the loaded nature of such moves. Their attempts to lie about their age are ridiculously bad and fool nobody, and they are completely clueless about sex and sexual health, displaying a bewildering lack of awareness that would be comical if it weren’t so alarming. The constant reinforcement of the girls’ childishness is what makes their dance routines so disturbing to watch; frequently filmed in a series of a short shots, often on a close-up of a body part. This technique mimics the style of the music videos the girls have consumed and further reinforces that they are only children. It is confronting to watch and it is designed to be that way. Any attempts to make the routines more palatable would have compromised the social critique that something has gone wrong where pre-teen girls such as Amy, Angelica and her friends feel they should present themselves to the world in a way that is not so different from how Amy’s conservative religious upbringing similarly presents women as commodities. A major part of what makes Maïmouna Doucour’s film so compelling is that it asks difficult questions rather than provide a simplistic answer. It would have been easy for Cuties to simply declare that sexy music videos are evil and corrupting and they should therefore be banned. Fortunately, the film doesn’t go down such a moralistic and narrow-minded path as it instead raises more challenging questions such as why the girls have been led to believe that they need to adopt moves and behaviour that they clearly don’t fully comprehend. Why are these girls so ignorant about sex? Why are they not aware of the differences between real life and the constructed fantasy of a music video? Why do they feel the need to project a femininity that conforms so aggressively to the male gaze? The tragedy of Cuties is not that expressions of sexuality are increasingly widespread in popular culture, but how badly family, education, religion and society have let these girls down so that they have misinterpreted and absorbed these expressions at such an inappropriate age. Sadly, Cuties is facing an aggressively misinformed backlash, mostly from people who haven’t seen it. The shockingly misguided decisions made by the streaming platform Netflix on how to initially market the film triggered this backlash, resulting in on-going accusations that Cuties is either deliberately promoting objectification of young girls rather than critiquing it, or that its attempts at making such a critique have failed as the film has inadvertently become what it is supposed to be against. Such claims are baseless as there is no doubt about the intentions of the film to seriously examine the highly inappropriate sexualisation of its protagonist. Most alarming is the way this backlash distracts from the complexities of the film, and it could well be the case that such a distraction is part of the intent behind the campaign to discredit Cuties. Labelling a single film as dangerous and such a threat to children that it must not be streamed into people’s homes out of concerns for the safety and wellbeing of the community, is a lot easier than grappling with the confronting questions a film like Cuties raises about the culpability of numerous aspects of culture and society that have contributed to the premature loss of innocence among children. Over time Maïmouna Doucour and her film will be vindicated. Despite the terrible initial mishandling of the film’s promotion, Netflix should also be acknowledged for holding its ground against the hateful ignorance being thrown towards it. It would be a very sad day when moral panic founded on baseless accusations leads to censorship. All this also distracts from the fact that among so many other things Cuties is a sophisticated coming-of-age story about a young girl torn between two cultures. It’s a film about the immigrant experience, family, friendship and the relationship between a mother and a daughter. It’s a film that ends on an incredibly beautiful final shot that confirms that at its heart is a brilliant young girl who we are allowed to hope will ultimately rise above everything thrown at her. While at times very difficult viewing, there is no doubting the sincerity and integrity behind Cuties."
"Sep 16, 2020",positive,"""Cuties"" is complicated and at times disturbing, but not for the reasons cited by its critics. It's an effective argument against exploitation, not exploitive in itself."
"Sep 16, 2020",positive," Cuties, Maïmouna Doucouré’s debut feature, became a subject of intense social media ire when Netflix released a poster showing four scantily clad young girls striking suggestive dance poses. It was accused of promoting paedophilia, and consequently, petitions to ban the film’s release and Netflix itself were signed. Maïmouna Doucouré’s debut feature Cuties (Mignonnes in French) has been
in the news for all the wrong reasons
. Last month, Netflix released a poster for the film showing four scantily clad young girls striking suggestive dance poses. Social media users instantly dialled the anger up to 11. Accusations of paedophilia promotion were made. Petitions to ban the film’s release and Netflix itself were signed. Death threats were issued against the French-Senegalese filmmaker. You know: the usual stages of social media’s cycle of rage. Watch a two-minute clip or a single representative image, and the chronically angry feel obliged to participate in every debate, and throw in a casual death threat like it were a legitimate form of criticism. Of course, these people have not seen the movie. Perhaps, they never will. If they did, they would realise the fact that Netflix chose that particular poster as a representative image of the film only seems to be proving Doucouré’s point: the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood and innocence. Sadly, her intentions were misunderstood in decontextualisation. In contrast to the US poster, the French version shows the young girls gleefully swinging their shopping bags as they saunter down a street. They are fully clothed, although they are wearing bras and underwear over their own clothes. It is far more representative of the film because it exposes their prepubescent naivety. Their clothes betray their understanding of what it means to be an adult. Moreover, it doesn’t take the film out of its coming-of-age context and reduce it to the sexualisation of young girls. Eleven-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf) lives with her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) and two little brothers in a poor Parisian neighbourhood. When she finds out her father intends to bring home a second wife from Senegal, she kickstarts a pre-teen rebellion by joining a twerking troupe who call themselves “Cuties”. Amy is instantly attracted to their exuberance, and quickly befriends the group’s leader, Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni). Being forced into the boys’ bathroom to film their genitals launches her initiation. Winning a dance contest the end goal. For Amy, dancing becomes a liberating outlet to escape her anxieties and detach herself from the domestic crisis. It becomes a kind of refuge as she transitions from tween to teen. Most of all, it helps her fit in. So, the veil soon makes way for crop-tops and booty shorts, as they symbolise liberation in Amy’s eyes. In a scene where the women gather for a prayer session, Amy hides in her hijab, pulls out her stolen phone and secretly watches videos of strippers twerking, hoping for pointers to freshen their choreography. The following morning, she teaches the “Cuties” what she learnt in an montage filled with butt shots. Surveying this minefield will definitely test viewers with low discomfort threshold, but it compels us to question our own gaze. The “Cuties” are not oblivious to the male gaze. After breaking into a game of laser tag, Amy twerks to keep the manager’s gaze transfixed on her to get them out of trouble. He forgets to call the police and lets them all go. It is a deeply disconcerting scene which exposes the voyeuristic gaze which has transformed a 11-year-old girl into an adult woman. Doucouré is clearly denouncing, not promoting, a culture which foists adult sexuality on pre-teen girls. These “Cuties”, who call Kim Kardashian their mom, rely on social media for validation. Doped up on Instagram likes, Amy and her “Cuties” yield to the pressure to conform to pop culture’s sexualised narratives. The number of Instagram likes become the sum of their self-worth, their life a popularity contest, and the accelerated maturation is their maladaptive response to it. These are girls who have barely completed the last rites for their childhood, but they are eager to skip the teenage phase and dive into adulthood. They dress the part, but it’s an imitation which reveals their ignorance. They are appropriating the sexual codes of adults without adequate literacy to take stock of what they imply. This is best exemplified in a scene, where one of them picks up a used condom, blows it up like a balloon, and then they all freak out believing she has been infected with AIDS. They then proceed to cure her by washing her tongue with hand wash. In another scene, when Amy surveys the derrières of the women in her community, it’s an education in the simple confluence of anatomy and dance, without any awareness of the “big booty” fetishisation in pop culture. Youssouf’s twerks, her gestures, and her pouts become a radical expression of this unsure prepubescence. Amy’s family believe these provocative dance routines to be a sign of demonic possession. She grapples with the demonisation of the female body, which is literally exorcised later in the film. Doucouré often opts for dream logic to formalise Amy’s internal anxieties about her femininity. The embroidered flowers on her blue dress begin to bleed, anticipating the beginning of her puberty. Once Amy joins the group, their friendship becomes as liberating as alienating. Because the “Cuties” are like any clique: there is a tender friendship that unites them but also a petty cruelty that can divide them. So, Amy finds herself torn between what her religious family want her to be, and what her pre-teen peers want her to be. In her efforts to shrink the gap between her family’s expectations and her friends’, a new identity awkwardly asserts itself. Doucouré’s own dual cultural identity is at the heart of the film, which illustrates the contradictions faced by Muslim families who migrate westwards. Her denunciation of sexualising young girls feels all the more stronger as it is anchored against a backdrop of the culture clash between the traditions of a conservative Senegalese-Muslim family and the faux-liberation of Western society. Though Cuties is tethered to Amy’s coming-of-age, it also gives us a parallel portrait of the mother chained to the weight of traditions. Hiding under the bed, Amy hears Mariam cry and then slap herself for not being happy about her husband finding himself a second wife. Her father’s presence is manifested only through phone calls in a film without considerable male presence, but the burdens of patriarchy still weigh on its women. Because its enablers can often be women, like the auntie who is always there to remind them on the ways of modesty. Mariam, however, gives her daughter a choice she can’t allow for herself. In the concluding shot, there is a smile on Amy’s face as the camera frees her from the gaze of sexualisation, the weight of tradition, and the pressure to fit in. It’s a young girl experiencing joy, freedom and innocence in its purest forms."
"Sep 16, 2020",positive," Adolescent struggles on film are a well-trodden path, but CUTIES (MIGNONNES) from Maïmouna Doucouré feels fresh and modern. That modernity often manifests in uncomfortable ways, but the authenticity of this portrait is evident. This personal story juggles several topics but the excellent performance of young Fathia Youssouf, in the challenging central role, provides a focal point for all of them. We follow Fathia Youssouf as Amy, a young French girl in Paris. She is being raised fairly traditionally in the Islamic faith by her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) while her father is absent, set to marry a second wife in Senegal, causing issues at home. After she spies Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni) in her building’s laundry room, she is intrigued by her – dancing exuberantly and straightening her hair with an iron – while fearful of the group of Angelica’s friends. Although the group bully her, Amy gradually ingratiates herself with her dancing skills. The girls’ dancing routine – prepared for an upcoming competition – seem too provocative for pre-teens, and the group are also eager to demonstrate their growing awareness of their femininity by presenting themselves as worldly and sexually aware. “Doucouré’s film places a tremendous amount of responsibility on Fathia Youssouf, who conveys the curiosity of youth as well as the confounding blend of determination and naivety one would expect of an 11-year-old.” Doucouré’s film places a tremendous amount of responsibility on Fathia Youssouf, who conveys the curiosity of youth as well as the confounding blend of determination and naivety one would expect of an 11-year-old. Doucouré’s self-penned script is also the source of this, in addition to some observant modern embellishments to this vignette of accelerated childhood and the clash of cultures Amy experiences between her family and friends. The story keenly positions the clashes presented to Amy during CUTIES to highlight the heightened sense of importance children attach to such exploits. The approaching dance competition takes on outsized importance to Amy, and the responsibilities to her mother and elderly aunt feel monumentally stifling. Doucouré’s direction and the actors combine to present the competing aspects of the girls’ actual maturity, their outward projection of it, and the external influences at play. The girls perform dance routines which allude to sex, yet will not recognise a condom in the grass. Amy will practice her dance routine in the bathroom, and the film will hard cut to her praying with her elders. Youssouf projects the artificiality of what young people present on social media, as a grin erupts on her face when the validation of ‘likes’ from her peers salves her self-consciousness. Far from being an austere affair, the film manages to elicit laughs at more than a few of such incidents and balances the tone effectively. In a manner, CUTIES is also unflinching. The dancing routines choreographed by the girls make use of provocative manoeuvres that draw the disapproving glances of parents and observers – they are uncomfortable to watch, just as the passive encouragement of the judges is uncomfortable to see. At the same time, however, Amy’s burgeoning confidence (perhaps overconfidence) is also apparent. These sequences foreground the impact that role models have on the different modes of expression and identity that children, and young women, in particular, may pursue. When Amy feels stifled by her traditional upbringing, her path with Angelica’s group is the only one seemingly open to her. “By the time the film concludes, it feels as though Amy may not be the only one who has begun to find balance and feel elevated – Maïmouna Doucouré maybe has also.” The film is generally content to observe, maintaining a reasonably naturalistic approach to an authentic-feeling story. Although the decision to begin in media res is puzzling, CUTIES is a personal and assured tale with a skill for identifying the essence of pre-teen behaviour, particularly for a first feature. There are some nice visual touches, with Amy’s most childlike moments being the most colourful: playing with translucent green beads, the varied and dramatic lighting within a laser tag arena (albeit in the sort of environment already well-mined in cinema for such aesthetic qualities). However, the visual flourishes are generally saved for the film’s final movements as Amy’s worlds collide, the film making greater use of colour to convey the chaotic internal moods of its protagonist. By the time the film concludes, it feels as though Amy may not be the only one who has begun to find balance and feel elevated – Maïmouna Doucouré maybe has also."
"Sep 16, 2020",positive," The debut film by Maïmouna Doucouré – a thoughtful, challenging and rewarding coming-of-ager – has been targeted by an army of keyboard warriors threatening both the streaming platform that hosts it and those who champion it to take dramatic action (Cancel Netflix! Cancel yourself!) over the film’s perceived explicit content. Cuties follows Amy (Fathia Youssouf), an 11-year-old girl desperately trying to wriggle free from the traditional values she has been raised on, as she grows to understand herself and other girls around her through dance. It’s not ballet or hip-hop – this is no subversive Billy Elliot. These girls thrust their hips and bite their lips in ferocious, magnetic performances. It’s provocative, destabilising, and electrifying. Doucouré explores her own roots, the tug of war between Senegalese Muslim customs and the rise of internet culture – putting the female body front and centre, the thrill of young girls coming to learn they’re allowed to be comfortable and confident in themselves. There’s no patronising or demeaning voice from the filmmaker – Doucouré’s camera takes care of her girls, championing their talent, forcing those who try to muzzle their freedom to take a long hard look at what they’ve been missing out on. As Amy, Youssouf is a force to be reckoned with, always keeping the viewer glued to her perspective as her eyes freeze on the girls she wants to be, the moves she wants to feel. There’s an immediacy that can often be lacking in the genre – although Cady in Mean Girls and Kayla in Eighth Grade narrate their wishes and frustrations, there is still so much more distance than in Cuties. Confidence is everything, and such a slippery feeling is explored with deep intelligence here, as the layers are delicate, complicated. Amy isn’t just a two-dimensional jittery kid yearning after the popular girls; she has an ocean of her own frustrations and talent that comes to bloom and threaten those she wants to impress. At such an age, every one of them is desperately lost and insecure, because of course they are. But Doucouré understands that there is a fire, a violence to them: a slap on the cheek, a deep sway of the hip, a stream of white-hot tears. Cuties is not a dangerous film that oversexualises young girls. It’s a hungry, ambitious, often devastating portrait of a youth that has been wrestling with this confusion – this severe whiplash between legacy and desire – forever. It’s not always cute, but the most disrespectful thing we could do to these girls would be to pretend it’s all they ever could be. This film shows how they are, how they thrive – and what a thrill it is to finally see it so colourfully. By choosing to look away, we only have ourselves to blame."
"Sep 15, 2020",positive,"A bold, heartbreaking, and fascinating mix of drama and comedy in the same ilk of ""Thirteen"" and ""Our Song."""
"Sep 15, 2020",positive," It’s infrequent that a film comes along with as much pre-release furor as Netflix’s recent “Cuties.” If you’ve heard about it online, you’ve likely heard one or more of the following: it promotes pedophilia, it’s a documentary, there’s underage nudity, and there’s 11-year olds performing sex acts on themselves and/or others. None of those are the case. That said, it’s a very raw and unsettling look at what these particular young girls believe to be the path to success and popularity. So, let’s kick off with what the film is about – it follows Amy Diop (Fathia Youssouf), an eleven-year-old Senegalese immigrant living in France with her conservative-Muslim family. The family is awaiting the return of her father, who it turns out has gone to marry a second wife and bring her back to France. Amy who is already isolated by the strict cultural dogma which she is surrounded with, rebels in protest for what she feels is the marginalization of her mother. She sees another girl who she goes to school with, practicing hip-hop dancing. She manages to get her way into that girls friend group and they decide that one way to become famous and popular is to emulate the kind of provocative dancing being done by the older girls. They decide to enter a dance competition to further up their status and they dial their efforts up, far beyond what would be remotely age-appropriate. Points to take away from the description is that there are no adults (or even older children) encouraging them to be sexy or to play up the twerking. In fact, in each moment of adults encountering the girls, they deride them for their actions. Even as the film gets to its contest performance finale, it doesn’t go at all the way films usually do (read: it doesn’t go well for the girls), because they do go over the top by a country mile.  The film absolutely is a manifesto about how young girls are over-exposed to hyper-sexualized content, and it is expressed to them as being expected of them and the path to popularity and follower counts on Instagram. They are fed waves of those signals, and without any other input to tell them otherwise, they may well run right off the rails. The film does not celebrate their actions in any way, if anything it leads to the girls downfalls and derision. There have been other films in recent years which are excellent that speak to the mix-signals given to underage girls in particular, such as “Eighth Grade,” however even then when Kayla (Elsie Fisher) gets herself into trouble by sexing it up, it’s handled gently. In “Cuties,” there’s nothing gentle about it. It’s like 2002’s “Irréversible” or 1986’s “Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer” – they are intended to induce shock and revulsion. Yes, sure, there will likely be a few pedos out there who see “Cuties,” and add it to their fantasy collection of films, just as there are those who take the others above as helpful guides in their own predilections. However for the main body of audience, the point of the film is in no way titillating – it’s to strive to point out that what an orthodox family (of any religion), which doesn’t give children any guidelines or moral grounding beyond “don’t do anything” and that child is adrift in the myriad mixed signals of the modern world (especially as it relates to social media and online followers-equating-to-self-worth) they can latch onto the wrong things. The above said, Netflix did itself no favors by changing it’s original French/Sundance release poster showcasing the main girls frolicking over a hill to one with the girls in their dance uniforms all in the hyper-sexual poses. That was a disservice both to the film and to its underlying message. They deserved to be called on the carpet for missing the moral of their own film. On the topic of the film itself, it’s not a bad film: the performances are solid, especially from a collection of such young girls. The pacing is slow, and there’s a bit too much done around Amy’s home and family. First time writer/director Maïmouna Doucouré wanted to showcase her own experiences growing up, and it is evidenced in the nuances around the interactions between the family and their wider tribal circle. You can tell the points she is drawing from her own experiences, because those are the areas she imbues with the levels of reality that give the textures, then the others are drawn with a more generic brush. The fact that the girls never get particularly good at the dancing, causing them to reach further and further across the line of age-appropriate behavior, speaks to the brutal sincerity of the situation they’re in. However, non of the character do we ever really connect with; we follow Amy’s story, but she’s a very damaged little girl, and hard to connect with her plight, at home or at school.  It’s hard to say who this film is best suited for, ideally it would be for kids to watch with their parents who can have a conversation with them to talk about how the messages of peer groups (and social media in particular) can be inappropriate and/or inaccurate. However it’ll be a hard sell for many parents to have those conversations with their kids. Even now it’s interesting to watch the dichotomy between the critics ratings (just shy of 90% fresh on RT) and the audience ratings (11%) – I expect that few of the audience members have actually watched it. Its morality message is going to be largely lost in many cases because of how unsettling and jarring it is to see these very young girls decide that this is how the judges and the world at large wants to see them act. It’s not comfortable to watch, and that’s entirely the point. It’s not meant to be comfortable, or easy, it’s meant to be remembered. And as a gauge of art, it succeeds, however a bit more moderation might not have hurt much, either. Bill Watters is a child of the late 70s- he walked into a theater to watch Star Wars, and emerged to become a lifelong fan of cinema and television. Spending nearly a decade as a projectionist, he fell into the Silicon Valley dot-com boom and became a codemonkey for a range of game companies.

"Sep 15, 2020",positive," I did some research regarding the area of Paris known as Little Africa, where CUTIES takes place. CUTIES focuses on a community of Muslim families originally from Senegal, a former French colony. France retains a tight grip on its former colonies: major French telecoms companies, banks and retail giants are ubiquitous in countries such as Senegal, and its political influence remains significant. As a result of that colonial history, French is the official language of Senegal. As of mid-2017, about 120,000 Senegalese lived in France, according to the United Nations estimates. France colonized Senegal in 1659 and French West Africa was a federation of eight colonial territories. Because of France’s colonial past and continuing influence in Senegal, special conditions allow Senegalese a preferred status to immigrate to France. Maïmouna Doucouré’s feature debut centers around 11-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf). She lives with her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) and two younger brothers. They have just moved into a new apartment. A crisis occurs when Amy’s father announces that he will be returning to Paris with a second wife. Mariam has dutifully prepared a newly decorated master bedroom for the couple. Mariam is shamed about the second wife, but her tradition-bound relative, Aunty (Mbissine Thérèse Diop), insists on planning an elaborate wedding celebration inviting their Muslim community. Amy shares her mother’s grief about the new wife and hopes her father will not return. For decades, polygamy was legal in France for immigrants arriving from any of about 50 countries where it is legally recognized. Historically, taking numerous wives was either a religious, social and economic necessity in poor countries with high death rates, or a sign of external wealth or male domination. France banned polygamy in 1993; however, the strong relationship between France and Senegal makes polygamy a very sensitive subject and it’s continued presence poses an economic burden on France’s generous social services programs. While her mother must abide by the teachings of Islam on multiple wives and obeying one’s husband in all things, Amy is introduced to the cultural reality that exists outside her restrictive upbringing. She watches Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), also 11 years-old, dancing with hip hop abandon in the communal laundry room. Angelica is dressed in teen stripper clothes and throwing her long hair around while practicing seductive poses. Is this writer-director Doucouré’s intent to sexualize children, garner controversy and promote child pornography or is it meant to  show how children are easily influenced and exposed to an excessive glut of highly sexual imagery? This sexual milieu is prevalent in every aspect of Western society and available in all media outlets. Without preaching from the pulpit, CUTIES forces the viewer to acknowledge some  responsibility. Everything is presented to suggest overt sexuality is a highly coveted commodity. Having “talent” is no longer a criteria for fame. In the past one had to find pop’s hidden Playboys or mom’s Harold Robbins books. Now, self-distributed sex tapes are the coin of the realm. Without good nude shots, how is a teenage girl going to get a date? Amy, an innocent child, sees how Angelica and her friends are respected at school. Angelica is the leader of her dance group, “The Cuties.” The girls,  Coumba (Esther Gohourou), Jess (Ilanah Cami-Goursolas) and Yasmine (Myriam Hamma), watch videos of female rappers and practice their suggestive dance moves. As the new girl at school, Amy is bullied by The Cuties, but using her cousin’s (Mamadou Samake) cell phone that she stole, offers to record the girls practicing their routine for the big dance-off competition. With access to all social media, Amy now begins to copy the ultra-sexy, exaggerated booty-moves of the adult performers.  Amy begins to encourage the other girls to follow her lead and soon they are all twerking and sliding around the floor mimicking sexual positions.  Yasmine gets into a fight at school and is thrown out of The Cuties. Since Amy secretly has been studying the routines, she begs to be part of the tryouts for the local, public dance contest. Soon Amy realizes her conservative clothes are not appropriate for The Cuties or school. She alters a T-shirt into a cropped top and functional shorts become cutoffs. Like the sexy videos, suggestive clothing holds no stigma. CUTIES is an indictment of our cultural acceptance – actually, a valuable currency – of highly provocative influences all of us are constantly exposed to.  After winning a place in the contest, Amy’s ambition versus her mother’s pending humiliation of the wedding collide. Amy has tasted freedom and makes some unwise, selfish choices. It is only the redeeming friendships and the joy of children laughing and playing together that anchors the film. And, to the director’s credit, no one sees any of the Cuties as sexual objects but as silly, little girls. I pay $15.99 per month for Netflix. I watch international films and series. I watched a Turkish series about a surgeon who took Ayahuasca and it turned him into Istanbul’s Mr. Hyde. I watched the India matchmaker series. There is enough content on Netflix that I am not hoodwinked into watching CUTIES. I had a choice. The “cancel culture” is a Big Brother ruse announcing that a petition has the power to make Netflix change its acquisition model. The need to make one’s voice heard has become the new fascism. If CUTIES is dangerous to the wholesome image of America, why is YouTube allowed to play Cardi B’s video for WAP? The lyrics (a few posted here) are outrageous and the video, which I liked a lot (except the absurd Jenner cameo), should also be added to the banned list.

"Sep 14, 2020",positive," Stop it. That's right; I'm talking to you, oh so righteous Netflix subscriber/internet pundit pouncing on “Cuties.” Don't play coy with me. I read what you wrote when you thought only a select few were paying attention. Scantily clad 11-year-old girls seen writhing their bodies to hip-hop and reggaetón beats? Naw, that's obscene! This is an outrage! There ought to be a law against such depravity, you whined.  Thing is, you didn't watch the movie, did you? You've convinced yourself you have in your possession all the information you need to know before you play judge, jury and executioner on  — pay attention, now, this part is important  — a modest, sassy and thoroughly engaging portrait of growing up Black, female and poor, of being caught between two cultures, each with their own set of challenges and complications.  But admit it: you didn't make it that far. You stopped at tween pelvic thrusts and suggestive gyrations. Then you put this genial Sundance winner in your crosshairs. You are not in good company. Others clutching their pearls have reportedly made death threats against the director and, in the case of a Texas legislator, calls to investigate it for possible violations of child exploitation and pornography laws.  Next time you want to go after a French-Senegalese filmmaker telling a story about being an African immigrant in Paris, do your research before you grab the pitchforks. Now go take your puritanical superiority somewhere else. Okay, reader, now that we've (hopefully) rid ourselves of the toxic snobs and internet trolls who have swarmed around “Cuties” (aka “Mignonnes”) with the intent of giving a bad name to a good movie, we can go ahead and delve into writer-director Maïmouna Doucouré's winning, refreshingly clear-eyed underdog tale.  Yes, its unblinking depiction of age-inappropriate behavior is not always easy to watch, but what it most definitely is not is gratuitous titillation. It amounts to part of a larger conversation about generational resentment, internet peer pressure, and that exhilarating and terrifying moment when a girl discovers that she's not powerless. The girl in question is Aminata Diop (Fathia Youssouf), though she mostly goes by Amy. As the movie opens, she's just moved into a cramped apartment in one of Paris' poorest neighborhoods with her hardworking mom Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) and two younger brothers, only to learn she'll have to share a bedroom with her mischievous baby bro Ismaël (Demba Diaw).  Living in a devout Muslim household, Amy takes her place next to Mariam, her matriarchal aunt (Mbissine Thérèse Diop) and the rest of the women at the mosque, veiled in vibrant colors. The tween is shy, withdrawn, content to be left alone. She also wants what more privileged girls have, and she's not above stealing a relative's cellphone to get her foot in the door, either. It certainly beats getting picked on by a quartet of standoffish girls at school that revel in disruption and mayhem. The scene where she first meets these troublemakers at the schoolyard makes you flinch: taunting shoves, lacerating name calling and a book bag's contents being spilled onto the ground. Doucouré makes no attempt to soft-pedal the girls' cruelty toward the new arrival, and the movie is stronger because of it. It's also clear, even at this early stage, that the filmmaker is dipping her toe in the underdog template.  Amy, you see, is undeterred to be part of this bad girl gang, comprised of Angelica (Medina El Aidi), Coumba (Esther Gohourou), Jess (Ilana Cami-Goursolas) and Yasmine (Myriam Hamma), despite the demeaning treatment. But why would she subject herself to that? This is where the dancing comes in. Her multicultural tormentors are keen on entering a talent competition, and in their minds, mastering a sexy routine is their ticket to victory. This is where Doucouré's skills as a storyteller come into play. Amy is looking to belong, and her quest for acceptance in her adopted new home takes her from the social media exposure she craves to making her case to join these would-be bullies' clique as a possible asset to qualify for the contest. “Cuties” could have settled for going through the dance movie story beats, at once familiar and comforting, but Doucouré wants to dig deeper. She weaves in Amy's relationship with the other girls, which is never sentimentalized, with a litany of domestic woes and rites of passage back home. Something most of the girls share is absent or neglectful parents, but in Amy's case, it's taken a step further. The elephant in the room is Amy's dad, reduced here to a voice on the phone promising to join his loved ones real soon.   When the movie reveals the reason behind the holdup, it shines a spotlight on the pitfalls that Senegalese women face. It also provides an explanation for Amy's escalating acts of defiance without letting her off the hook. Thus, Amy's escape down the rabbit hole of music videos showing grown women wielding their sexuality like a weapon does not occur in a vacuum. Rather than merely depicting the way girls are objectified as a trendy narrative hook, as its ill-advised U.S. marketing materials suggest, “Cuties” unpacks a complex set of sociocultural circumstances that converge to place the prepubescent characters in a position where they would think these risqué, exotic dancer moves are not just achievable but desirable. (Ask yourself: would there be such an uproar if “Cuties” told the story of five boys getting into trouble and falling into a life of crime?) Amy wants to assert her womanhood, even though she's only on the cusp of adolescence, in order to thumb her nose at a stifling culture that would literally keep her covered, and also in a rebellious rebuke of a father whose selfish actions have taken away the stability she yearns for. Her discontent has a dangerous beat, and she can dance to it. As “Cuties” hurdles toward its climactic showdown on stage, this reviewer was torn between cheering on the characters and their gradually improving dancing skills and being dismayed over their lapses in judgment. And then I realized that's what makes Doucouré's writing so effective. In opting against passing judgment on these girls, or on their imperfect elders, she refuses to take the easy way out. She takes Amy on a journey of self-discovery where the stumbles are not cushioned but the hard-earned lessons yield genuine growth. The movie might not reinvent the wheel thematically, but it moves to its own syncopated rhythms. Ignore the online discourse and give it a chance. “Cuties” had its world premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, where Maïmouna Doucouré picked up a directing award in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition. It's now available to stream on Netflix. THEATER: The actor nominated for a Tony Award for his portrayal as Mrs. Doubtfire in the Broadway musical comes to Fort Lauderdale in the national tour.

"Sep 14, 2020",positive," Adolescence is a time few want to relive, but its inherent dichotomies are inexhaustible fodder for cinema. Cuties, Maïmouna Doucouré’s debut, evokes Céline Sciamma’s vision of youth in Water Lilies and Girlhood in its first moments, as quiet outsider Amy (Youssouf) becomes enthralled with a dance troupe – specifically the one girl who lives in her building – that exudes confidence, popularity, and the certain type of cool that comes from mimicking adulthood. The adolescent awkwardness then swings into its own unique commentary on young womanhood as Amy earns a spot in the crew, confronting her identity as the team works towards their next dance competition. This clash between the girls’ lived experience and knowledge with the image they exude on stage is brilliantly captured by Yann Maritaud’s cinematography and some unselfconscious performances from the brilliant young leads. The Cuties take inspiration from an older troupe, including moves far too sexualised for 11- and 12-year-olds. Their ignorance of their choreography’s connotations – bumping butts is a source of amusement – comes across in the dancers’ wide smiles and the camera’s pans to uneasy spectators. These moments contrast against Amy’s French-Senegalese family’s expectations, whose complicated internal judgements are conveyed through each changing perspective. The film’s tone is not always consistent, leaning just enough into visual comedy that one wishes it probed further into the absurdism of a world that sexualised girls without educating them on their own comfort. But throughout, Amy’s young perspective is given precedence – and sometimes that values the fleeting glimpse of a boy over decisions that rock her family unit. Cuties is rough around the edges and slightly undercuts itself in an incongruous denouement, but it respects the silliness and sadness of Amy’s coming-of-age journey. The film’s visual confidence and unaffected performances from its young cast speak of bright futures for all involved.

"Sep 14, 2020",positive," Fue, porque ya no lo es, la película del escándalo de -o para- Netflix. Se acusó a la campaña publicitaria de incitar a la pedofilia, de sexualizar a la infancia, de mostrar a niñas de once años sensuales, y hasta se creó un hashtag #NetflixPedofilia y se propuso boicotear la película. Si bien el afiche con el que la plataforma de streaming decidió publicitar al filme francés Mignonnes, de Maïmouna Doucouré, era diferente del original con el que se lo promocionó este año cuando participó en el Festival de Berlín, lo mejor, siempre, es ir al origen. En este caso, la película. Amy se siente como sapo de otro pozo tanto en su familia como en la escuela. Tiene once años, en su casa no la dejan entrar a una habitación, porque su madre la está preparando para cuando su padre regrese de Senegal… con su nueva y segunda esposa. En la escuela no tiene amigas ni amigos, y cada día se siente con más ganas de integrarse a ese grupo de compañeras, que se viste de otra manera, que se expresa diferente, que formaron un grupo de baile -las Guapis del título en castellano- con el que ansían ganar un concurso. Que bailan con más sensualidad de la que debieran, seguro. Pero la opera prima de esta directora no hace centro deliberadamente allí, aunque se preocupe por marcarlo, sino en las necesidades de Amy por abrirse camino en la vida en medio de restricciones religiosas, costumbres o ritos musulmanes y en descubrir, sí su femineidad. Porque en definitiva lo que Guapis es, es una película de crecimiento, que trata sobre esa etapa de transición que suele ocurrir en la adolescencia, en que se deja de ser niño para comenzar a convertirse, en este caso, en mujer. La protagonista carga con todas sus inseguridades a cuesta, y sin haber escuchado la frase que asegura que no hay mejor defensa que un buen ataque, toma decisiones. Algunas seguramente desafortunadas, pero Amy no tiene otra guía que no sea probar y ver si no erra, accionar antes que reaccionar. Hay que ponerse en su ropa. Tapada hasta la cabeza por una cuestión religiosa, cuando se muda ve otras chicas que visten y se muestra desinhibidas, y si la integración a un nuevo ámbito puede traer complicaciones, a Amy se las traen como en un container. Guapis, en su forma, es un filme bastante clásico. La controversia pasa por otro tamiz, por cómo mostrar el crecimiento de una niña, su desarrollo, sin ofender a nadie. Y eso, parece, es casi imposible. OK, Amy trata de convencer a sus nuevas compañeras -no necesariamente sus amigas- de sexualizar el número de baile. ¿Es un gesto de rebeldía, en medio de una realidad que es completamente opuesta a lo que estaba acostumbrada por tradición? ¿Por qué debería aceptar sin chistar la resolución de su padre, y seguir con la cabeza gacha como hace su sufrida madre? La mirada de la realizadora no es meramente contemplativa. Hay juicios de valor puestos en primer plano, escenas en las que las redes sociales juegan un papel preponderante y en las que subir una foto puede desencadenar más que un conflicto. Guapis es una película audaz o valiente, que no es precisamente lo mismo. Porque hay que tener firmeza para atreverse, sí, pero mucho más firmeza en las convicciones. Comedia dramática. Francia, 2020. Título original: “Mignonnes” . 96’, SAM 16. De: Maïmouna Doucouré. Con: Fathia Youssouf, Médina El Aidi-Azouni, Esther Gohourou. Disponible en: Netflix."
"Sep 14, 2020",positive,Director [Maïmouna Doucouré] posits forward a film that proposes a highly nuanced debate that was tainted by a glaring error on Netflix's part. [Full review in Spanish
"Sep 14, 2020",positive," Fear hangs heavy over Cuties, the Sundance-winning coming-of-age debut from Maïmouna Doucouré. In the film the fear of God is taught to Amy (Fathia Youssouf) from a young age. “Evil dwells in the bodies of uncovered women,” warns the preacher at her women’s service. Fear has also shrouded the release of Cuties itself, after a misguided poster choice from distributor Netflix sent bleak messages about sexualised girls into a trigger-happy Twittersphere. The poster image of Amy and her crew, backlit, and provocatively positioned in skin-tight uniforms, does feature in Cuties. Here are some other images that feature: Mariam’s (Maïmouna Gueye) bare feet, seen from under a bed as Amy listens to her crying at the news that Amy’s father is taking a second wife; a Parisian sky punctured by glitter and rainbow-coloured hair extensions that the girls have thrown giddily into the air; a prism of emerald light as Amy and her brother peer through a beaded necklace. The world that Doucouré has written for her lost girl is so gorgeously crafted and considerately framed that when the supposedly raunchy dance moves arrive, they translate at worst into clumsy mimicry, at best the catalyst for self-realisation. The moves that the girls have picked up from music videos and social media are both a form of cultural commentary but also an extension of their chaotic energy, which Doucouré takes care to show manifest in other ways like fake shootouts at laser tag and scrappy fights with locals. The girls’ unpolished but harmonious performances — especially between Youssouf and Médina El Aidi-Azouni, who plays gang leader Angelica — are dampened slightly by Netflix’s decision to dub the film, another misfire especially given its recent push for bilingual content. The world may be weighing against this French-language indie about a child whose family is falling apart. Push aside the headlines, however, and you’ll be rewarded with a vibrant, morally intelligent film that ironically reserves judgement."
"Sep 14, 2020",positive," Should this film be cancelled? Or, to raise a secondary point: should one see this film before taking a view on such things? It’s still surprising to me, even having lived through so many controversies like this, how many people can’t quite bring themselves to answer “yes” to the second question, or they say that watching the film simply plays into the filth-merchants’ hands, a sorrowing paradox I remember first encountering during the National Theatre run of The Romans in Britain. Mignonnes, or Cuties – an interesting, flawed debut feature for Netflix from Franco-Senegalese director Maïmouna Doucouré – finds itself at the centre of the nastiest obscenity row since David Cronenberg’s Crash in 1996. This is because of sequences showing a group of naive, excitable 11-year-old girls in a dance group twerking and pouting their way through a grotesquely sexualised adult routine. There has been an ugly and abusive social media storm, dominated by vicious trolls who haven’t seen the film and by mischief-makers jumping at the chance to embarrass those with Netflix connections such as the Obamas. Yet the film and its accusers turn out to be on the same side: Mignonnes attacks the pornification of girls and young women by social media and society in general; it is about the false promise of liberation in this kind of sexualised display. The offending scenes are gruesomely unwatchable – deliberately so. (A final scene in which the girls present their routine at a dance competition shows people in the audience becoming baffled and disgusted, with one apparently complaining to the judges.) It is about a lonely 11-year-old French girl of Senegalese origin: Amy (Fathia Youssouf) who has learned that to be female is to be a second-class citizen. She has witnessed the wretched humiliation of her mother, because Amy’s father just got engaged to a second woman back in Senegal and wants to bring this woman over to France to live in their small flat. At religious meetings, Amy and all the other women are told they must obey their husbands, a dogma fiercely enforced by a community elder, known as “auntie”, or La tante, in which role Doucouré has got out of retirement the veteran Senegalese actor Mbissine Thérèse Diop (who was the star in Ousmane Sembène’s Black Girl in 1966). And so, quietly desperate at her oppression, Amy becomes fascinated by an outrageous girl-gang in her year at school (the “Cuties”) who don’t give a damn about anything and are bumping and grinding through a dance routine they’re working on for a local competition. At first, they pick on Amy, but she makes friends with them, steals a smartphone so she too can participate in the endless Instagram narcissism festival and then insinuates herself into the Cuties’ dance troupe by inventing even more outrageous moves for them. In a way, it’s a classic Mean Girls storyline, provocatively backdated to the tween years. Weirdly, the film seems to predict and pre-empt all the language of debate. When a harassed teacher tells them to stop dressing inappropriately, the Cuties defiantly raise a cry for “Freedom!” as they are dragged off. And when a security guard tries ejecting them from a laser-tag hall they’ve sneaked into, they shout: “Stop groping me, you child molester!” At some level, they have a precocious sense of what’s at stake, but they are as naive as children – the children they actually are – about what’s happening. The film doesn’t entirely work. There are untied plot strands; the film hits its ideas a bit squarely on the nose and I wasn’t sure about the supernatural moments in which the frumpy dress that Amy is given to wear by her mum seems haunted by the woman that Amy is destined to be. But it all hangs together, and the good faith with which it is presented to the audience is clear enough. A lot more good faith than Twitter and its pitchfork mob."
"Sep 14, 2020",positive," For this critic, there are two telling scenes among many that stand out in Migonnes, now better known as Cuties, that typify its challenge and its caution. They are not among the headlining, fire-branded clips of its maligned Netflix marketing. Nevertheless, the jarring tension is ever-present. In a scene in the first half of the award-winning French film, one of the central 11-year-old girls finds an open and very likely used condom in a public park. She doesn’t know what it is and inflates it to create a pretend boob to impress her friends for laughs. One of her peers immediately stops her and explains in quick fashion the disgustingness of what she’s touching. The puffed-up confidence in the initial girl is quickly erased with mortification. In a reply of shock and embarrassment, all she could muster to say was “How was I supposed to know that. It’s not my fault I didn’t know what it was.” No, young lady, it sure wasn’t your fault. Scenes like that one and many others completely devoid of adult supervision, positive influences, and honest coming-of-age education typify in a dramatized fashion the challenges and dangers of gender definitions, self-image, sexual freedom, and dozens more that often engulf teenagers. Cuties is a movie that displays those tangible negatives. The second scene comes later. Moving like a moth to deadly fire all movie long, our main character Amy, a Senegalese Muslim immigrant to France played with bracing emotion by Fathia Youssouf, has fully embraced the devil-may-care lifestyle of a local clique of fellow girls that call themselves “The Cuties.” In trying to earn attention and prove her presumed worth for their shared dance competition goals, Amy has lashed out and committed acts that even the hardcore original Cuties define as wrong and too far. They kick Amy out of the group and it enrages her further. That was a telling turning point. For the wildest girls that throw caution to the wind, even they had their limits and lines in the sand. It is very likely that their collective limits will exceed those of the domestic audiences watching this film at far earlier moments than this late collapse. If even reading those two scenes is too much, welcome again to challenge and caution. That is the honest reality examined by Maïmouna Doucouré’s film.  To rewind, Amy comes from a transitioning household of poverty and tradition. Her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) is raising three children alone while hurt internally by the move of her children’s father to take another wife and exit the parental picture. Mariam’s anger creates a wavering seesaw between despondency and strictness where the differing religious and cultural implications loom large in Cuties.  LESSON #1: HOW TO BECOME A WOMAN-- Amy’s familial elders insist on teaching her how to be a woman, which on some level entails preparing food, remaining clothed and pius from external evils, and maintaining a demure personality of complete obedience. Who deems that to be the right or wrong way to that adulthood? Is that fair and free femininity? How often does that forced ideal create oppression and objectification instead of true freedom and, most of all, choice. Where is that correct benchmark? Welcome again to challenge and caution. LESSON #2: THE WRONG FRIENDS ARE THE WRONG INFLUENCE-- Compared to the rigidity at home, The Cuties, led by an accommodating apartment neighbor named Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), look attractive and fascinating to Amy. The truth is they are plastic bullies who are ruthless and rule-less with little to no social boundaries. Initial silliness quickly turns more deviant. Their peer pressure first against Amy and then to later include her is sexualized with taboo mischief and attention-seeking thirst for male crushes. Those aren’t good friend choices, but a lonely and jaded newcomer like Amy doesn’t see that or know better. LESSON #3: THE ACT OF EMULATION-- What these girls are superficially pretending to be with their fashion choices, body image, language, and behavior is a warped theory of what their unguided and uninformed selves think a superior woman needs to be. The ease of digital access to adult content shows these youths that the more a woman is sexualized, the more successful they are. The rest is emulation not all that far removed from girls in the 1980s channeling an attitude and practicing Madonna’s bold dance moves as a chance for self-expression. Content choices and ratings notwithstanding, dancing counts as engagement and skill-building practice with choreographic detail. Could dancers use that skill for better things? Of course, but in Cuties who or what is there to offer alternatives? LESSON #4: THE INVASIVE DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA-- Back then, the audience for your little MTV concert was yourself in a mirror or, at most, a slumber party group of your besties. Today, it’s the wide-open and unfiltered outlets of social media like TikTok or Instagram on an internet crawling with privacy-invading eyes and predatory presences. The risks are exponentially worse. You are watching, but who else is? How secure is your privacy and, for that matter, your dignity or innocence? Welcome again to challenge and caution.  The film does not discount such dangers in the slightest, quite the opposite in fact. For a film that rarely leaves the shell-shocked and world-absorbing face of Youssouf, the increasing and desperate failures from her difficult situations and culture clash confusion flesh out a valuable and compelling tale of staunch social warnings. There are lines between provocation and expression. Cuties is far more the latter than the former. If your ruffled feathers ask what kind of monster could make what the rumors say this movie is, pause that fear-mongering to watch and listen to the filmmaker herself. Maïmouna Doucouré, winner of the directing award for World Cinema at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, researched this for a year-and-a-half. She is your essential perspective and necessary context. This is not my lifestyle to judge nor yours. Projecting your ideal here of what is explicit or exploitative is out of place in allowing her to tell her story. It’s pure and rank bias when you do that. LESSON #5: WHAT ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO DO ABOUT IT-- When it comes to Cuties, if you don’t like what you see of these errant kids left to their own wiles and devices, your gut is accurate and working. If its imagery bothers you, it’s supposed to. Check your gaze and your privilege. Now, look past the fictional take and target the very valid and present potential problem in our own settings and lives off the Netflix couch. If you don’t want that, prevent it with education. If you don’t want those sexualized elements to be goals, don’t make them so appealing and desirable to the uninformed. Adjust those expectations or create better ones. Shake your head, change your stance to empathy and honesty, and act accordingly to our daughters and children. Get there and you have made it precisely to the point that is being hammered home."
"Sep 14, 2020",neutral," Whatever gifts French writer/director Maïmouna Doucouré brings to the table, “subtlety” isn’t included. Her challenging, provocative hot-button Tween Girls Gone (somewhat) Wild drama “Cuties” (“Mignonnes” in French) slaps you in the face–hard — and not just once but repeatedly. Doucouré (“Maman(s)” is her best-known credit) grabs “growing up too fast in the West” and rides that message with a vengeance, eschewing smooth, natural transitions in favor of shocks to the system. It’s as jarring as it is unsettling, crosses lines she doesn’t need her to cross to make her points, and abandons religious hot buttons she seems too timid to wholly engage. When we meet her, Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is a wide-eyed innocent. She’s 11, dutifully looking after two younger brothers, one in diapers. She is on the cusp of womanhood within her emigre community, listening in on the Muslim women’s ministries’ entreaties to “obey your husbands,” and “fear Allah.” But her mother (Maïmouna Gueye), keeping the family together by herself, has gotten troubling news. Her husband has found a second wife, and is bringing her back to France to marry and move into their apartment. Mother Mariam had no say, and doesn’t have to articulate the betrayal this feels like. Amy has just absorbed this news when she spies a classmate shaking her groove thing and ironing her long hair in the apartment complex’s laundry room. Amy is transfixed. She watches, admires and envies. She would love to be in with Angelica’s (Médina El Aidi-Azouni) crowd. They’re a brash, brusque and tightnit quartet that wants to compete in the big dance-off coming up. Amy is entirely too square, too unskilled, too socially awkward and plainly-dressed to crack in with blonde bully Jessica (Ilanah Cami-Goursolas), pushy Coumba (Esther Gohourou) Angelica and Yasmine (Myriam Hamma). Besides, they’re already a quartet. Sure, she can video them rehearsing. But “I can learn” to dance won’t mean a thing if they don’t alter their lineup. At home, Amy starts acting out. Her mother understands why she won’t talk to her father on the phone, but is totally unaware she’s stolen an uncle’s phone and her mom’s money, and has utterly immersed herself in the hyper-sexualized Western culture that the Cuties represent. Adults are totally out of the loop with this crowd. Amy neglects her babysitting duties, hides her new, makeup-and-coochie-cutters/halter top look and makes it her business to imitate her more “mature” peers in every way — flirting with boys, imitating the vulgar displays of underclad music video dancers, and backing up her sisters in her new gang. Doucouré jerks Amy, and us, through every stage of this transition. One scene, she’s still the demure but curious immigrant. The next she’s Nicki Minaj and Sherri Moon Zombie, a bumping, grinding, pouty-mouthed sex object, totally tarted-up if not quite aware of exactly what it is she’s impersonating. Youssouf plays Amy as an open-book wonder, eager to “fit in” — numb or just stunningly naive when it comes to recognizing how out of line her behavior is in the culture she’s been raised in. At several points in the film’s third act her “We-need-to-act-older-than-11” peers recoil, and say “You’ve gone too far” to our heroine. It’s not out of line to think our director has committed the same sin. If a guy had filmed this (As if!), he’d have to hide out in the Polanski Pedophile Precincts of Switzerland. But it’s not really messaging or Doucouré hitting her points too hard that took me out of “Cuties.” It’s the many abrupt transitions, the too-sudden conversion Amy undergoes, the avoidance of showing stark repercussions within her Islamic community and the unbelievable way Amy comes to understand what she has become and its personal, sexual and moral consequences. Doucouré brings a much-needed new perspective and new voice to the cinema. But this doesn’t have the depth or grim impact of a “Kids” (1995) or “thirteen” (2003). And signing on with Netflix, where “M.I.L.F.” and “An Easy Girl” are just the French entries in the streaming service’s race to find a young-younger-youngest sexual “edge,” is no way to pick up one thing her storytelling desperately lacks."
"Sep 13, 2020",positive,The audience may have some growing up to do.
"Sep 12, 2020",positive," There is an urgent need in our world for the development of empathy and critical thinking, especially when it comes to social media. Our information now comes to us in tweet-sized skimmable headlines, often without requiring us to think too deeply about the greater issues at hand before we click the “share” or “like” button and move on. Clickbait abounds, conspiracy theories thrive, and “cancel culture” has become commonplace. What this Internet-based culture of immediacy tends to promote is knee-jerk reactions, often exacerbated by ideological alliances which generate simplistic either/or dichotomies. To some degree, this makes sense—it’s much easier and quicker to place something or someone into an already-known category—good/bad, liberal/conservative, etc.—in order to celebrate or condemn it than it is to actually read/listen/receive the art/idea/person in question and attempt to understand it/them. Patient contemplation and careful reading are difficult practices not often granted public rewards. This is partially why I find cinema so important to our present-day discourse: it allows us to empathetically enter into another’s world, to imaginatively occupy various subjective positions, to have a sense of temporary immersion or participation in someone else’s value system and experience, to feel how they feel, and thus perhaps to have our own imaginations, alliances, and praxis be reoriented for the better. We are made to slow down, take a break from the everyday world, and (at least when theaters were open) turn off our electronic devices in order to truly pay attention the cinematic world before us. And as both philosopher Simone Weil and Sister Sarah Joan from Lady Bird rightly attest, love and attention can be the same thing. How we pay attention may be indicative of whether and how we love. Maïmouna Doucouré’s attentive, empathetic, and daring feature-length debut Cuties (Mignonnes) directly engages with these cultural concerns of social media and getting attention, both within its diegetic world as well as in the extra-diegetic backlash to the film’s deeply problematic marketing from its distributor, Netflix. The coming-of-age film follows Amy (Fathia Youssouf), an 11-year-old Senegalese immigrant living in the banlieues of Paris with her mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye), and her little siblings. As the family holds to very traditional religious beliefs, Amy finds herself caught between numerous worlds: between Senegal and France, between conservative religion and liberal secularism, between being a child and an adult. As she quietly observes the complex world around her, Amy longs for a sense of belonging and identity. She tries to find it in a group of fellow tween girls led by Angelica (Medina El Aidi), a fiery queen bee who lives in Amy’s housing project. The spunky clique spends much of their time practicing dances and posting them to social media, all in preparation for a local amateur dance contest. The girls are immature and mean, bullying one girl out of the group as they try to act more grown up than they really are by wearing tight and revealing clothing or using crass language to make themselves sound “older.” As Amy becomes more aware of her own body and burgeoning sexuality, she finds herself less sure of her family’s traditions and drawn further into both the Cuties’s orbit and the influential online world. Doucouré employs a distinctly cinematic language to address the concerns of growing up in the age of social media. The camera often follows Amy closely while respecting her interiority (unlike many coming-of-age films about teen girls, there are conspicuously no voiceovers), granting her a sense of autonomy even as it remains nearby like a watchful guardian. The distinctive and vivid mise-en-scene in conjunction with the cinematography blurs the lines between social realism and expressionism, but all of it is imbued with a sense of empathy. From the way Cuties is structured, it’s clear that Doucouré wants us to care deeply about these characters, especially about the ways they are treated by society and how they in turn treat others. In many respects, Cuties is a well-crafted, ambitious debut from a clearly talented director, and I’m eager to see what Doucouré creates in the future. This is not to say that Cuties is beyond criticism. The story is so primarily concerned with Amy that the fellow Cuties are not really given distinctive personalities beyond being the brazen girls Amy desires to emulate. Also, there are numerous sequences which are discomforting precisely because they walk the line between condemnation and representation. Two montage sequences in particular—one where Amy teaches the girls how to twerk after learning about it online, another where the girls film themselves provocatively dancing on a staircase in order to later post it on social media—are often troubling in the camera’s lingering on the girls’ bodies. It makes us aware of our complicity as we watch the girls dance, and that should unnerve us. And the various disturbing behaviors Amy finds herself enacting, such as attempting to film a boy in the school bathroom or posting a picture of her genitalia online (to be clear, nothing explicit is ever shown), should disturb us as viewers. The film never endorses such behaviors, but it does make us aware that these behaviors happen; and they do…all the time. In this sense, Cuties is a universal story, as there are Amys currently all over the world, young people trying to navigate what is right and wrong while mainly being guided by what they find online. What is set in a Parisian immigrant neighborhood is not so different from the local American elementary or middle school. I say this as an observation, not as some sort of prudish reproof nor as an endorsement—it simply is the world we live in today, and Cuties portrays that world with a sense of raw authenticity and thoughtful care. Ultimately, Cuties sharply critiques both conservative religious patriarchal systems which tend to emphasize women’s modesty and submission and the liberal “whatever goes” sexualization of women in general, and young girls in particular. In this regard, one of the film’s faults may be its didacticism. From the start, it is absolutely clear on what the film is critiquing—i.e., the unhealthy and exploitative sexualization of preadolescent girls—which is ironically also what its loudest detractors are decrying in their own blinkered way. And so the film’s finale at a dance contest is not altogether surprising, and even feels a bit unearned. Still, the final shot is one of empowerment and hope imbued with a bit of the fantastical, not unlike a similar film, and one of my personal favorites: Anna Rose Holmer’s masterpiece, The Fits. What becomes strikingly obvious both within Cuties‘s diegetic conflicts and in the real-world backlash is the need for wise mentors. In the film, the adults who are supposed to be guiding Amy into adulthood are often completely oblivious to her whereabouts and actions, and totally out of touch with the present-day issues she faces. Mariam in particular seems too overwhelmed by her own personal struggles with her husband’s new wife (a complicated situation, to be sure) to offer any real assistance, thus leaving Amy to basically fend for herself. But Mariam is not alone; this phenomenon is happening outside of the film too. Many adults who are supposed to model virtuous character are the same adults so busy posting grammatically-incorrect trollish outrage on social media in order to boycott a Netflix-distributed movie that they aren’t able to see the sophomoric example they are setting for others. Tragically, as we’ve seen evidenced all too frequently, growing in chronological age does not correlate to growing in maturity. Good reasoning and research skills, logical acuity, and empathetic listening—in short, practical wisdom (phronesis)—are in short supply. So, should you watch the film? I can’t answer that for you. Use wisdom and discernment to decide for yourself. What I can say is that Cuties, like all good movies, may generate empathy for a person or community beyond our own limited real-life experience precisely through the immersive audio-visual form. And in our present era of endless divisions, we need all the empathy we can get."
"Sep 12, 2020",positive," Cuties became the subject of controversy because of promotional materials Netflix released. The streaming service’s suggestive artwork misrepresented the film by taking a provocative scene out of context. If the hubbub is what drives people to see Cuties for themselves, hopefully they will recognize it is a lot more complex and nuanced.  Amy Diop (Fathia Youssouf Abdilahi) lives with single mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) and helps watch her brother Ismael (Demba Diaw) when Mariam works. Amy sees Angelica (Medina El Aidi) dancing and ironing her hair in the laundry room. They become friends, while Amy also watches a quartet of girls at her school, the Cuties, practicing for a dance competition.  The girls in Cuties are 11. There is a sweetness and innocence to their friendship, but their activities border mature territory. It’s sweet when Amy and Angelica jump on the bed and gorge on Gummy Bears. Amy helps the Cuties record their routines, and practices their moves herself in private. They also chase older boys in the park, and find a used condom which they don’t exactly know how to deal with. That foreshadows Amy’s journey with the Cuties. Writer/director Maïmouna Doucouré portrays Amy’s point of view in the movie. She often overhears adults when they are trying to shelter her from their discussions. Amy’s father is getting married again and Amy avoids both the relationship with her father, and the cultural traditions associated with it.  The Cuties are an escape for Amy. They’re a conflict too as she has to balance her familial responsibilities with this activity and her new friends. Amy has a lot of freedom when she’s unsupervised, but there are harsh reminders that her parents still control her. It will still be a few years before she’s truly independent, but there are moments of agency she can claim at 11.  Sexuality enters the picture when Amy starts becoming more provocative than the Cuties’ choreography. The point is that they’re too young to go that far. Amy gets too provocative in the way a naive child would be confused. She does not know the full ramifications of what she’s exploring. It’s tasteful and it’s a poignant point about the line between fun, empowering dancing and going too far too young. The suggestive image that caused all the fuss with Cuties comes from the final performance of the movie. At that point, there is something uncomfortable about watching 11-year-old girls copying the sorts of movies that Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion might perform. That, too, is the point.  The Cuties just think that’s how they’re supposed to dance. They’re emulating what they see, but they don’t think of it as sexual. To just show that image without the buildup, let alone the aftermath of Amy’s realization, robs it of its poignancy.  The world is a confusing place for adults, let alone children. Children will see what’s going on in the world and they’ll process it their own way. Adults can help with supervision but there’s still only so much you can control. Cuties is about that journey of self-discovery every child, and in this case especially women, go through. It is ultimately innocent, but Amy may experiment with corruption before she decides who she’s going to be.  I live in the heart of film and television, and go wherever the story is to talk to the people who perform and create them. If you see a typo, that's my cats trying to help me write."
"Sep 11, 2020",positive," On Wednesday, Netflix releases “Cuties” (“Mignonnes”), the remarkable first feature from the French filmmaker Maïmouna Doucouré. Unfortunately, the platform’s misleading advertising has given rise to a scurrilous campaign against the film itself. The promotional image, showing young girls in bikini-like clothing dancing in provocative ways, matched with an inaccurate description, has been taken to suggest that the film celebrates children’s sexualized behavior. In fact, the subject of the film is exactly the opposite: it dramatizes the difficulties of growing up female in a sexualized and commercialized media culture. I doubt that the scandal-mongers (who include some well-known figures of the far right) have actually seen “Cuties,” but some elements of the film that weren’t presented in the advertising would surely prove irritating to them: it’s the story of a girl’s outrage at, and defiance of, a patriarchal order. The girl is Amy Diop (Fathia Youssouf), an eleven-year-old of Senegalese descent, who lives in France with her observant Muslim family. At the film’s beginning, she moves with her mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye), and her two younger brothers into a new apartment in a Parisian housing project. The apartment has a secret: a room, kept locked, that Amy is ordered to avoid. Amy (short for Aminata, and pronounced with a short “a,” like the French word ami) is a dutiful child, kept in line lovingly but sternly by Mariam and by “Auntie,” her great-aunt (Mbissine Thérèse Diop), who’s steeped in traditions that she passes along to her niece. Amy, who’s quiet and shy, is also socially isolated—she has no cell phone, knows no one at school, and isn’t inclined to express herself or introduce herself. As for her father, he’s away, visiting the family’s homeland. Much is being made of the festive plans for his return—but Amy learns, accidentally, that the point of his trip is to take a second wife, and that he’ll soon be returning to Paris with her. The sealed room in the family’s apartment will be the new wife’s bridal chamber. Amy takes this news as a betrayal of her mother—especially after she discovers that Mariam, who is made miserable by the news, is being coerced, by Auntie and by the entire social structure of their community, into celebrating her husband’s polygamy and welcoming the new bride into her home. At an all-female prayer meeting that Amy and Mariam attend in the building’s common room, the preacher, a woman, decrees, “We must remain modest. We must obey our husbands.” Auntie tells Amy, “Do everything you can to please your mother.” Now that order of modesty strikes Amy as part of a system that subjugates women, and pleasing her mother means deferring to that system. Instantly, Amy enters a state of revolt, which is all the more emotionally wrenching for her lack of a vocabulary to discuss her feelings and her lack of friends to discuss them with. She associates modesty with misogyny and obedience with oppression, and so she acts out, overthrowing both in a series of increasingly reckless actions. Soon after moving in, Amy sees a neighbor and classmate, Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), doing a hip-hop dance while doing laundry in the building’s basement. Soon thereafter, Amy sees Angelica similarly dancing with three other girls near an abandoned train yard. At first, they insult her and throw rocks at her. When she approaches them at school, they tell her that they’re preparing for a dance competition (the group’s name is the Cuties, les Mignonnes). Amy knows that the girls are trouble—she sees them defying teachers and getting disciplined in the schoolyard and running wild in a supermarket—but she resolves to join them. She soon finds that their dancing is inseparable from their sexual curiosity and brazen provocations, which are matched by their ignorance about sex. Angelica, in particular, is a gleeful troublemaker, at times seeming nearly sociopathic, as when she steals her older brother’s work shirt, slams another girl’s computer to the floor, and assaults another member of the group. As a sort of virtual hazing at school, the Cuties push Amy into the boys’ bathroom to video-record a boy’s genitals. Her membership in the group involves her self-aware misconduct, transgressions that she undertakes quickly and coldly: stealing a cell phone from a cousin, stealing money from her mother, fighting with another girl, making herself an object of social-media scandal, even several acts of potentially grave violence. For Amy, belonging to the Cuties means more than a new activity or a new set of friends—it means forging for herself a new, self-chosen identity, which she clings to desperately, at great risk and great cost. Before becoming a filmmaker, Doucouré was in the sciences (she has a degree in biology), and there’s something admirably analytical about her cinematic methods. Though “Cuties” is a sharply dramatic film that sticks closely to Amy throughout and observes her actions in detail, Doucouré brings background ideas to the foreground, inviting sociological and abstract considerations alongside the sharp delineation of character. She shows Amy undergoing the many tribulations of maturing—and, in each of these anecdotally depicted events, extracts from them an element of cultural context. (For instance, when Amy gets her period, Auntie says that, at Amy’s age, she was engaged and was married a few years later—a fortune that she wishes on Amy, too.) The subject of “Cuties” isn’t twerking; it’s children, especially poor and nonwhite children, who are deprived of the resources—the education, the emotional support, the open family discussion—to put sexualized media and pop culture into perspective. Left on their own—Angelica, for instance, is virtually unsupervised by parents who are working very hard to keep their restaurant afloat—they’re unable to find or even to seek the line between liberation and exploitation, between independence and imitation. “Cuties” is about the absence of knowledge and absence of reasonable discourse about sex and sexuality, power and desire, that help young people to avow and confront these drives constructively—or, at least, not too destructively. Lacking those things, Amy latches on to a mode of revolt that is itself a trope of a misogynistic order. “Cuties” is a film of the center, and it’s aesthetically of the center—it depicts the unconsidered without advancing to the realm of the subjective, and it doesn’t allow its young protagonists much discourse, outer or inner. It’s not a movie of introspection and self-consideration; it’s more a story of the rule than of the exception, of what’s unduly extraordinary about the effort to live an ordinary life. As such, it’s a story of French society at large—its exclusions and the exertions demanded to overcome them. Though many of Amy’s actions are dubious, her spirit of revolt is nonetheless sublime and heroic. “Cuties” dramatizes what people of color and immigrants endure as a result of isolation and ghettoization, of not being represented culturally and politically—and of not being represented in French national mythology. Its underlying subject is the connection of personal identity to public identity—and the urgency of transforming the very notion of French identity, of changing the idea of who’s considered the representative face of France. That idea is brought to the fore in an extraordinary, brief, symbolic ending; it’s enough to give a right-winger a conniption.

Sin embargo, es todo lo contrario a lo que sus detractores (que ni siquiera la habían visto cuando presionaron para la cancelación del estreno) argumentaron."

"Sep 10, 2020",positive,"Cuties is the kind of movie that is actually a very impressive piece of filmmaking and storytelling, but its subject matter and depictions make it impossible to recommend."
"Sep 10, 2020",positive," The hysteria surrounding Maïmouna Doucouré’s Cuties (Mignonnes) is, like many such controversies in the era of QAnon conspiracy theories, much ado about nothing. To be fair, Netflix’s tone-deaf marketing campaign is mostly to blame for early reports that the film featured the inappropriate sexualization of pre-teen girls, but that marketing campaign was not only deeply inappropriate, it was also completely incongruous to the film it was attempting to promote. In fact, it’s quite the opposite – Cuties is a sobering, often deeply moving portrayal of the lengths to which young girls will go to find acceptance in a hyper-sexualized world that places primary importance on the desirability of women’s bodies. Netflix’s embarrassing marketing campaign seemed more as if they were promoting the latest season of Dance Moms, complete with scantily clad young girls looking as though they’re having the time of their lives — a bit like the climax of Little Miss Sunshine played completely straight. Yet the tone of Cuties couldn’t be further from the sparkly, brightly-colored promotional materials that caused such stir in the darkest corners of the conservative internet just a few weeks ago. The damage has been done, of course. Doucouré was forced off Twitter after receiving an onslaught of death threats, and there were calls to ban the film altogether. It’s unlikely those who attacked it sight-unseen will ever give it the chance it so richly deserves, but it’s their loss because Cuties is an altogether remarkable film. It centers on Amy (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi), an 11-year-old girl of Senegalese descent living in France with her mother and younger brother, who desperately wants to fit in with a school clique known as the “Cuties.” Aloof, popular, and aspiring hip hop dancers, the Cuties welcome Amy into their circle, and she quickly becomes immersed in their world as they train for an upcoming dance competition. But the further she descends into their hyper-sexualized world, the further she drifts from her family and her culture, as they deeply confuse Amy’s attempts to grow up in a world that wants her to become an adult far too quickly. Cuties is something of a coming-of-age nightmare, grappling not only with society’s sexualization of young girls, but also the general treatment of women as little more than sex objects (Amy’s unseen father is in the process of bringing in a second wife from Senegal, leaving her mother depressed and adrift). Amy also suffers much harsher consequences for her behavior than her fellow Cuties, reinforcing long-held stereotypes of black girls as being more adult and sexually aggressive. It’s within this ideological cloud that Cuties navigates some tricky emotional waters, and it’s often difficult to watch, but there is something incredibly cathartic about the way that it allows Amy to reclaim agency over her own life and grow up on her own terms, apart from cultural and social expectations. Doucouré’s direction has a haunting, often otherworldly quality; its occasional hints of magical realism recalls Mati Diop’s intoxicating work in Atlantics. There are few more striking examples of the intellectual dishonesty and misplaced outrage of QAnon’s mindless conspiracy-mongering than Cuties, a broken conservative ideology that eschews nuance and takes very real problems like pedophilia and human trafficking and turns them into cartoon villainy in an online culture war for which there can be no victor. But much like Hillary Clinton’s pizza parlor sex ring, the pedophilic themes of Cuties simply do not exist. It’s a disturbing and complex critique of the very thing it’s accused of celebrating, anchored by a strong central performance and a deep sense of empathy for victims that the online discourse surrounding it noticeably lacks. It’s an elegy for lost innocence, but ultimately a hopeful one, as it seeks to reclaim childhood from a society that is all too content to dismantle it."
"Sep 10, 2020",neutral," The French film, which I saw this past January at Sundance, will be available to stream on Netflix next month and follows an 11-year-old Senegalese Muslim girl who joins a provocative dance group of twerkers. I remember, as I was walking to the Eccles at Sundance, bumping into “Cuties” producer Sylvain de Zangroniz and being asked what I thought of the movie — I tried to change the conversation to another topic, but he didn’t relent, I finally plainly stated to him that “it just wasn’t my cup of tea”.  I didn’t care for “Cuties” one bit, in fact, I thought it was a repulsive film that sexualized an eleven-year-old girl’s innocence for the sake of female empowerment. We see outrageous musical montages involving close-up crotch shots and sweaty pre-teens feeling themselves while soaking up the music on-stage. It’s a clearcut attempt at provocation from Doucoure, but it fails miserably. It doesn’t help that the film, a cliche-ridden coming-of-age-tale, is dull beyond belief — there’s nothing interesting about its we-have-to-win-the-dance-contest plottings.  Maïmouna Doucouré, the film’s director, claims the movie “is in fact a critique of the sexualization of children, specifically the Internet’s role in it.” That’s not what I saw. It’s all part of the damage control being created to justify streaming this film to a massively large Netflix audience."
"Sep 10, 2020",positive," There’s a saying in criticism that “depiction does not equal endorsement.” Art should be able to address taboos without necessarily advocating for them, but some surface-level readings miss what the work digs into because it’s not obvious at first glance. In the wake of conservative outrage over an early poster of debut writer/director Maïmouna Doucouré’s “Cuties,” this is a sentiment that bears repeating. The film actively critiques the very thing pearl-clutchers were mad about—the sexualization of children—but Doucouré received death threats. Netflix, the movie’s distributor, issued an apology.  Controversy aside, “Cuties” is a difficult and challenging film, pushing the idea of “depiction does not equal endorsement” to its limit. It will not surprise me to read responses still accusing the movie of what it condemns. However, Doucouré uses these uncomfortable images to provoke a serious conversation about the sexualization of girls—especially regarding girls of color, the policing of a girl’s sexuality, double standards, the effect of social media on kids, and how children learn these behaviors. To do this, the director shows what it looks like for young girls to emulate what they see in music videos and grown-up dance routines. A few times in the film, we see the confused or even disgusted faces of adults watching the younger generation gyrate and twerk, biting their lips or their nail in a suggestive way. It’s likely that these girls don’t fully understand what those gestures mean, but they see it in pop culture and they imitate it, like several other generations of girls before them. Doucouré also explores some of the emotional tangles that come with wanting to fit in and to be taken seriously, as well as the repercussions that come with acting youthfully impulsive. Many of these experiences were rooted in the director’s own childhood or in the stories of girls she interviewed when working on the “Cuties” script.  “Cuties” is a coming-of-age story of a girl caught between cultures and age. 11-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi), the eldest daughter of a Senegalese family living in Paris, must help her mother, Miriam (Maïmouna Gueye), around the apartment with mundane tasks like watching her younger siblings, going out for supplies, and cleaning messes. Then, Miriam learns that her husband has taken a new wife, and Amy is reluctantly swept up in the preparation for their impending nuptials. Although her family is devoutly Muslim, Amy begins to admire a dance group at school who call themselves Cuties—Angelica (Medina El Aidi), Coumba (Esther Gohourou), Jess (Ilanah Cami-Goursolas) and Yasmine (Myriam Hamma)—and tries to join their ranks. She starts dressing more like them and doing what they dare her to do. Finally, she figures out a way to get the cool girls to accept her by learning provocative moves that will help them win a dance competition against a rival group of older girls. Amy gets caught up in the whirlwind of her emotions and runs afoul of her mother’s expectations.  Under Doucouré's direction, the film walks a fine line between its controversial imagery and taking a step back to reveal the emotional impulses that drive Amy and her friends to seek attention and affirmation. There are echos of films like “Eve’s Bayou,” “Girlhood” and “The Fits,” but given Amy’s age and the directness with which “Cuties” addresses the issue of sexualizing young girls, the film feels uniquely its own. With the help of cinematographer Yann Maritaud, Doucouré adds little surrealistic elements and uses color to make her images pop off the screen. For instance, there’s a recurring motif of Amy transfixed by the dress she’s supposed to wear for her father’s wedding, and different things happen to it that correspond to what she’s going through. It’s likely not a mistake that the turquoise color of the dress echoes some of the colors around the apartment, tying together the threads of culture and home into one. For every dance scene that may make you want to avert your eyes, there are other uncomplicated moments of childhood playtime like Amy and Angelica talking with their mouths full of gummy bears or four of the girls running with shopping bags throwing confetti, like they’re leading a parade for themselves. As if following the beat of Niko Noki’s music for the film, “Cuties” moves at a quick, riveting pace. The two parts of Amy’s world are seamlessly connected together by editors Stéphane Mazalaigue and Mathilde Van de Moortel.  The movie is so much more nuanced and bold than the first wave of outrage charged. With “Cuties,” Doucouré announces herself as a director with a keen visual style who’s unafraid to explore these cultural and social tensions. After all, these are issues facing many young girls growing up today in various corners of the world. You’d just never know it because their coming-of-age horror stories aren't always told in film.  Perhaps the most important message of “Cuties” is that no matter what Amy says or does, she’s still just an 11-year-old girl. People are quick to judge her for trying to act like an adult, but really, all she wants is to feel cool and fit in. She wants to be liked, and what person who survived middle school couldn’t identify with that? She thought the way to do that was to emulate others. Instead, she becomes a cautionary tale in the process.  Monica Castillo is a critic, journalist, programmer, and curator based in New York City.

"Sep 9, 2020",positive," The reputation of the Netflix Original film Cuties precedes itself, unfortunately. Director Maimouna Doucoure’s movie earned accolades at the Sundance Film Festival for its critical observations about society’s oversexualization of youth — and then Netflix hyped the movie with a provocative poster featuring a decontextualized shot of its 11-year-old-girl characters in provocative poses. In direct opposition to the film’s themes, you might note. The marketing bungle resulted in internet mobs calling to ban the movie before the vast majority of people had even seen it, because why would anyone want to make an informed decision before voicing their outrage? And now that everyone can finally watch it, will its preemptive critics actually do so, and share a more enlightened response?  The Gist: Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is 11 years old, hiding under the bed as her mother sits on it, sobbing in between phone calls. Mariam (Maimouna Gueye) is telling people the “joyous” news that her husband, Amy’s father, is taking a second wife. They and Amy’s two younger brothers are new to a Paris housing project, and the apartment has a still-empty room to accommodate her dad and his new bride when they arrive from Senegal. Mariam takes Amy to their Muslim prayer group, where an elder woman preaches the evils of “scantily clad” women, and how all women are obligated to obey their husbands. Mariam’s elderly auntie sternly upholds such traditions as their solemn duty. Amy doesn’t seem impressed with the sermon. On her way back to the apartment, she sees Angelica (Medina El Aidi) in the laundry room, dancing in tight pants and pressing her hair straight on the ironing board. She sees Angelica in school, too, with three other girls in booty shorts, navel-bearing shirts and heels, taking selfies and obnoxiously enjoying the type of freedom that’s shockingly foreign to Amy. After school, the girls practice their provocative hip-hop dance moves, hoping to audition for a competition; they dub their squad the Cuties. Amy soon squeezes into her younger brother’s shirt and integrates herself into the clique. She proves her mettle by studying booty-shaking videos — with earbuds, hiding under her hijab during prayer meetings — and participating in the type of overbearing delinquent behavior they find endearing. Meanwhile, the dress she’ll wear to her father’s wedding hangs in the closet like a bad omen. His arrival looms, as does the dance audition, and Amy’s behavior grows increasingly extreme. What kind of person will she become? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Girlhood explores similar coming-of-age themes by telling the story of a Black girl growing up in Paris. Catherine Hardwicke’s Thirteen may be an even closer comparison, when you consider its discomfiting level of too-much-too-soon-ness. Memorable Dialogue: An Islamic clergyman tells Miriam, “God has never imposed on women more than they could bear. If your burden is too heavy, you have the right to leave this marriage.” Our Take: Doucoure emphasizes the social claustrophobia of Amy’s existence — her apartment’s narrow hallways hem her into the demeaning subjugation of her religious upbringing (one that her mother may not wish upon her). Compare that to the wide-open, airy shots of the Cuties strutting through school or practicing their dance routines, a space so liberating, they veer toward an altogether different kind of tragedy. Suffice to say, Cuties is a challenging film, more so for its moral centrism than its depiction of twerking 11-year-olds — 11-year-olds who clearly haven’t the foggiest idea as to the physical mechanics of sex. Inspired by her own upbringing, Doucoure doesn’t aim to demonize secularism or religious ideology, but rather, to ponder how a modern woman-to-be like Amy will define herself among such extremes. If the filmmaker takes aim at anything, it’s the male gaze; the film forces the perspective on us until we squirm not in disbelief, but in despair. Doucoure carefully nurtures character and setting to create a tangibly realistic tone. Nothing Amy does, no matter how extreme, seems out of step with the realities of social media or peer pressure. Notably, Amy’s father is never seen, his presence more fearsome as an invisible force for oppression. Wisely, Doucoure never really passes judgment on any of these characters, allowing our own emotions to emerge unmanipulated, although she does end with one remarkable and encouraging final shot, suggesting there’s hope for young women who make one mistake or another. They’re fragile and susceptible, sure, but they’re also strong and enduring."
"Sep 9, 2020",positive," Thankfully, we’re getting a slower week this week after the past few weeks of absolute insanity with so many new releases. This week, we also get a nice string of movies about women that are mostly made by women directors, so hopefully these won’t get lost in the shuffle of theaters reopening. To be perfectly honest, I went into Unjoo Moon’s I AM WOMAN (Quiver Distribution) – this week’s “Featured Flick” – thinking it was a doc about ‘70s pop sensation Helen Reddy. Imagine my surprise to discover that it actually was a narrative film with Tilda Cobham-Hervey playing the Australian singer who moved to New York in 1966 after winning a contest, expecting a record deal but only winding up with disappointment.  Once there, she’d meet journalist Lilian Roxon (Danielle Macdonald, being able to use her real Australian accent for once) and Jeff Weld (Evan Peters), the man who would become her manager and then husband. Once the couple move to L.A. with Helen’s daughter Traci (from her previous marriage), things began to pick up at the same time as Reddy starts dealing with issues in her marriage and friendship with Roxon. There were many takeaways from watching Moon’s film, but one of the bigger ones is how amazing Cobham-Hervey is at portraying a woman that few of us may have actually seen perform even on television. I’m not sure if Cobham-Hervey did any of her own singing or is lip-syncing the whole time, but it doesn’t matter because she instills so much joy into the performances, especially the two times she sings the highly-inspirational title song live. Although there isn’t a ton of major drama in Reddy’s life, most that does exist revolves around her relationship with Wald, who is depicted by Peters as an out-of-control coke-sniffing monster. Those in Hollywood may have dealt with Wald as a movie producer or during his stint as Sylvester Stallone’s manager, and only they will know how exaggerated this performance is. Far more interesting is Helen’s friendship with Macdonald’s Roxon which would inspire her to perform the song “You and Me Against the World.”  (Seriously, if you want a good cry, throw that song on after watching I Am Woman.) Moon does a great job with the material, whether it’s recreating New York in the ‘60s – often using music to set the tone of the period – or by framing Reddy’s story with Phyllis Schlaffly’s fight against the ERA, as depicted in FX’s mini-series Mrs. America.  Still, it never loses track of Reddy’s journey and her role as a mother to Traci and slightly less to Wald’s son, Jordan. The movie ends with a wonderful and tearful epilogue, and I will not lie that I was tearing up more than once while watching this movie. I Am Woman may be relatively uncomplicated, but it’s still a compelling relaying of Reddy’s amazing story bolstered by an incredible knock-em-dead performance by Tilda Cobham-Hervey. It’s also one of the most female-empowering film I’ve seen since the Ruth Bader Ginsburg movie On the Basis of Sex, starring Felicity Jones. This week’s primary theatrical release is Natalie Krinsky’s THE BROKEN HEARTS GALLERY (Stage 6/Sony), starring Geraldine Viswanathan as Lucy, a young woman who works at a gallery who is still obsessed with her ex-coworker/boyfriend Max. On the night of her  disastrous break-up, Lucy meets-cute Nick (Dacre Montgomery from Stranger Things), who later inspires her to rid of her hoarding issues by creating the “Broken Hearts Gallery.” This is a place where people who have broken up can bring the remnants of said relationship by donating the mementos they’ve maintained from their partners as sentimental value. I’m a big fan of Viswanathan from her appearance in Blockers and TBS’ “Miracle Workers” series, as she’s clearly very talented as a comic actress, but I couldn’t help but go into this with more than a little cynicism, because it does follow a very well-worn rom-com formula that can be traced right back to When Harry Met Sally. Yup, another one.  Much of this movie comes across like a bigger budget version of a movie that might play Tribeca Film Festival, and I wish I could say that was a compliment because I’ve seen a lot of good movies at Tribeca. But also just as many bad ones. The problem is that The Broken Hearts Gallery isn’t very original, and its roots are especially obvious when it starts interspersing the recently-heartbroken giving testimonials. It’s also a little pretentious, because rather than the real New York City that would be recognizable to anyone who lives there, it’s more of a Millennial woke fantasy where everyone is a 20-something LGBTQ+ of color.  Even so, the main trio of Lucy, Nick and Nick’s business partner Marcos (Arturo Castro from Broad City) do keep things fun even when things are getting predictable. To be honest, I’ll be perfectly happy to see Viswanathan become the next Meg Ryan, because part of the reason why I warmed up to the movie is because I thought she was quite great in it. (I hate to say it but she’ll definitely need a simple name to remember to make that happen. I’d like to suggest G-Vis… as in G-Vis, she’s awesome!) There’s no question she’s the best part of the movie, but it also thrives from some of the other women cast around her, including Molly Gordon, Phillipa Soo and (surprise, surprise!) Bernadette Peters. (At times, I was worried Lucy’s friends would get particularly annoying, but you’ll warm up to them as well.) Krinsky’s movie is cute, and while it certainly gets a little overly sentimental at times, there are also moments that are quite heartfelt, so basically, it’s a tolerable addition to the rom-com genre. The fact that the characters are so likeable kept me from outright hating the movie, especially once it gets to its corny and somewhat predictable ending. Another thing I like about Broken Hearts Gallery is that at least it’s making an effort to have some sort of theatrical presence, including drive-in theaters. Next up is Jon Stevenson’s RENT-A-PAL (IFC Midnight), a rather strange and very dark horror-comedy. It stars Brian Landis Folkins as David, a lonely 40-year-old living with his elderly mother suffering from dementia, who has been using the services of a dating service called Video Rendezvous. This is the ‘80s after all, so it involves getting VHS testimonials from various women. One day, David finds a tape labelled “Rent a Pal” and he decides to check it out. It turns out to be a video of a guy named Andy (Wil Wheaton aka Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation) who David begins having conversations with, but once David gets his chance to have a real relationship with a nice woman named Lisa (Amy Rutledge), he’s been dragged too far down the rabbit hole with Andy’s evil urgings. This was recommended to me by my own personal rent-a-pal, Erick Weber of Awards Ace, who saw it weeks ago. I totally could understand why he would have liked it, because it’s pretty good in terms of coming up with an original idea using elements that at least us older guys can relate to (especially the living with your Mom part which I had to do a few years ago).  I wasn’t sure but I generally thought I knew where it was going, because David’s trajectory always seemed to be heading towards My Friend Dahmer or Maniac territory. What I liked about Folkins’ performance is that you generally feel for him right up until he gets to that point. I also really liked his innocent relationship with Lisa and was hoping things that wouldn’t get as dark as where they eventually end up. I also have to draw attention to Wheaton’s performance, because as one might expect if you only know him from the “Star Trek” show he did as a kid, this is a very different role for him similar to Seann Michael Scott in last year’s Bloodline. Either way, Stevenson is a decent writer and director who really pushes the boundaries with where Andy takes his new friend, and it’s especially great for its synth-heavy soundtrack that reminds me of some of John Carpenter’s best scores, as we watch David’s inevitable descent into madness. You’ll frequently wonder where it’s going, but for me, it just got too dark, so I only really could enjoy it up to a point. A little cheerier is UNPREGNANT (HBO Max), the new film from Rachel Lee Goldberg, who directed the recent Valley Girl remake, although this time she’s adapting a book written by Jenni Hendricks. It stars Haley Lu Richardson (from Split and Support the Girls) as 17-year-old Veronica who discovers that her dopey boyfriend Kevin has gotten her pregnant. Since women under 18 can’t get an abortion in Missouri without a parents’ consent, she goes on a road trip with her estranged childhood friend Bailey (Barbie Ferreira) to New Mexico to get the job done. It’s more than  little weird seeing this movie come out in the same year as a much more serious version of the same movie in Elyza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometime Always. That aside, Goldberg and her cast do their best to make this something more in the vein of last year’s Book Smart, although that’s also a fairly high watermark for any movie. Because this is a road trip comedy, it tends to follow a fairly similar path as other movies where they meet a lot of strange characters along the way, as they try to get a ride after being busted cause Bailey stole her mother’s boyfriend’s car for the trip. For instance, they meet a friendly couple who tend to be pro-lifers who want to change Veronica’s mind, and the best side character is Giancarlo Esposito as a conspiracy theorist named Bob.  I guess my biggest problem with the movie is that it just isn’t that funny and feels fairly standard, but at least it has a decent ending to make up for the predictability of the rest of the movie.  Now streaming on Netflix is Maimouna Doucouré’s French coming-of-age film Mignonnes aka CUTIES, a film that premiered at Sundance and then stirred up quite a bit of controversy last month due to its marketing campaign, but is actually not the pervy male gaze movie which it may have been sold as. It’s about an 11-year-old Sengalese girl named Amy Diop (Fathia Youssouf) who wants to join the school’s “cool girl” dance group, known as the “Cuties,” even though it goes against her family’s Muslim beliefs.  Amy learns to dance so she can be part of the dance team and take part in a dance competition, but you know that this decision will led to trouble.s Cuties got a lot of backlash from for the trailer and Netflix’s decision to release Doucouré’s movie, which is about a young girl discovering her sexuality, although it isn’t really something lurid or gross but actually a very strong coming-of-age film. I haven’t seen the trailer, but I can only imagine what scene it focused on that got people so riled up, since there are dance scenes that felt a little creepy to me. Other than that aspect of the film, Cuties is as innocent as a Judy Blume book. I mean, how else do you expect kids to learn about real life than movies like this? (Unfortunately, the movie is TV-MA so young teens won’t be able to watch it.) The big problem with the Cuties is that they’re actually kind of bratty and bullies, almost like a younger “Mean Girls” girl gang, so it’s very hard to like any of them. They’re also trying to act way older than they really are, and you can only imagine what dark places that might led, as you worry about Amy getting dragged down with them, just because she wants to have friends and feel popular. Despite my issues with Cuties, Maimouna Doucouré is a fantastic filmmaker, and this is a pretty amazing debut, especially notable for how she’s able to work with the young cast but also make a movie that looks amazing. That said, Cuties is a decent coming-of-age film, although I feel like I’ve seen better versions of this movie in films like Mustang and The Fits.  Also from France comes Justine Triet’s SYBIL (Music Box Films), starring Virgine Efira (who appeared in Triet’s earlier film, In Bed with Victoria) as the title character, a jaded psychotherapist who decides to return to her passion of writing, getting her inspiration from an actress patient named Margot (Adèle Exarchopoulos), who she becomes obsessed with. I don’t have a lot to say about this movie other than it wasn’t really for me. As far as French films go, a movie really has to stand out from the usual talkie drama filled with exposition, and though I thought the performances by the two women were great, I didn’t really care for the script or the pacing on this one. After playing at last year’s Cannes, Toronto and the New York Film Festival, Sybil will be available via Virtual Cinema through Film at Lincoln Center and the Laemmle in L.A. as well as other cities. You can watch the trailer and find out how to watch it through your local arthouse at the official site.  Liz Garbus and Lisa Cortés’ doc ALL-IN: THE FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY (Amazon) follows Stacey Abrams through her run for Atlanta Governor in 2018, but it also deals with the laws that had been put in place to try to keep black voters from taking part in their right as Americans to be able to vote. I’m not sure what’s going on with me right now, but I generally just don’t have much interest in political docs right now, maybe because there’s so much politics on TV and in the news. I also have very little interest in Abrams or even having the racist history of the American South drilled into my head by another movie. I was born in 1965, my family didn’t even live in this country until 1960, and I’ve spent my life trying to treat everyone equally, so watching a movie like this and being preached to about how awful African-Americans have been treated in parts of the South for hundreds of years, I’m just not really sure what I’m supposed to do about it here in New York. I guess my biggest problem with All-In, which is a perfectly fine and well-made doc – as would be expected from Garbus – is that it lacks focus, and it seems to be all over the place in terms of what it’s trying to say… and I’m not even sure what it is trying to say, nor did I have the patience to find out. I thought Slay the Dragon handled the issues with gerrymandering far better, and I think I would have preferred a movie that ONLY focused on Abrams and her life and political career than trying to make a bigger statement. All-In will open at a few drive-ins (tonight!) and then will be on Amazon Prime on September 18. I was similarly mixed on Jeff Orlwosky’s doc, THE SOCIAL DILEMMA, which debuted on Netflix this week. This one looks at the addiction people have for social media apps like Facebook and Twitter, and how the information of what people watch and click on is collected into a database that’s sold to the highest bidder. Basically, it’s your worst fears about social media come to life, but my issue with this one is that the filmmaker decided to hire actors to dramatize parts of the movie, showing one family dealing with social media and phone addiction, which seemed like an odd but probably necessary decision other than the fact that the topic is so nerdy and so over my head that maybe it was necessary to illustrate what’s being explained by programmers. Again, not a terrible doc, just not something I had very little interest in even if it is an important subject (and I’m probably spending too much on social media and essentially more of the problem than the solution). I saw S. Leo Chiang and Yang Sun’s doc OUR TIME MACHINE at Tribeca last year, and I quite liked it. It follows influential Chinese artist Ma Liang (Maleonn) who collaborates with his Peking Opera director father Ma Ke, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s, on an elaborate and ambitious project called “Papa’s Time Machine” using life-sized mechanical puppets. I don’t have a ton to say about the movie but it’s a nice look into the Chinese culture and traditions and how the country and art itself has changed between two generations. One doc I missed last week but will be available digitally this week is Michael Paszt’s Nail in the Coffin: The Fall and Rise of Vampiro about semi-retired professional wrestler Ian Hodgkinson aka Vampiro, who is a Lucha Libre legend.  There’s a lot of other stuff on Netflix this week, including THE BABYSITTER: KILLER QUEEN, the sequel to the Samara Weaving-starring horror-thriller, again co-written and directed by McG (Charlies Angels: Full Throttle). This one stars Bella Thorne, Leslie Bibb and Ken Marino, as it follows Judah Lewis’ Cole after surviving the satanic blood cult from the first movie. I don’t know nearly as much about the British comedy series The Duchess, other than it stars comedian Katherine Ryan as a single mother juggling a bunch of things. Julie and the Phantoms is Netflix’s latest attempt to be the Disney channel with a movie about a young girl named Julie (Madison Reyes) who decides to start a band with a group of ghosts (hence the title). It’s even from Kenny Laguna, who is best known for the Disney Channel’s biggest hits High School Musical and The Descendants.  Other stuff to look out for this week include Kevin Del Principe’s thriller Up on the Glass (Gravitas Ventures), which is now available On Demand, digital and Blu-Ray; the Russian dogs doc Space Dogs (Icarus Films) – available via Alamo on Demand; Phil Wall’s doc The Standard  (Gravitas Ventures), and Andrei Bowden-Schwartz, Gina O’Brien’s tennis comedy All-In (on Amazon Prime and VOD/Digital) and Sam B. Jones’ Red White and Wasted (Dark Star Pictures).

"Sep 9, 2020",positive," Proving there is such a thing as bad press, Netflix’s Cuties might never recover from its disastrous marketing, despite it being a touching, personal coming-of-age drama. The furore whipped up around Maïmouna Doucouré’s Sundance darling Cuties was something to behold. Where to begin in unpacking it is anyone’s guess. On the one hand, you have a deeply personal and obviously considered coming-of-age drama from a French-Senegalese director about an 11-year-old Muslim girl who joins a dance group in large part as rebellion against the conservatism of her religion and the ostracization she experiences as an immigrant. On the other hand, you have Netflix, who chose to market that story with a promotional image of pre-teen girls in skimpy outfits and suggestive poses. It was such a phenomenally stupid and short-sighted decision that you can’t help but feel it deserved the immediate, frenzied backlash, which insisted that Netflix was actively sexualizing young girls and that anyone who supported the film was a paedophile. The problem with that response is that the film itself is pretty good and well-worth seeing. Most of the time it’s pointless trying to argue with anyone on the internet, much less trolls and conspiracy theorists and the other standard types who immediately gravitated towards the controversy as though it was an arrow in the all-seeing eye of heathen Hollywood. But Cuties isn’t a Hollywood film; it’s an observant and well-observed foreign-language curio from a minority filmmaker about a lived minority experience. None of this is to say that Cuties is inured from criticism, just that it requires a more nuanced perspective since it is, itself, built on nuance and not the glossy exploitation that Netflix perplexingly chose to sell it as. It’s important to understand that the film’s protagonist, Amy (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi), a Senegalese immigrant living in Paris with her mother and two younger siblings, is in a constant state of suffocating emotional constraint. She is hemmed in not just by her dingy apartment, the master bedroom of which is in the process of being done up for Amy’s father’s second wife, but by the cultural expectations and traditions that lead Amy’s mother to blame herself for her husband’s infidelity. Amy, then, is a prisoner, of her mind, her culture, her status. And all prisoners are inclined to look for the shortest path to freedom. For Amy, that path does indeed wind through an energetic but inappropriately dressed and styled pre-teen troupe who she’s introduced to by her upstairs neighbour Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni). The “Cuties”, as they call themselves, look their age but try not to act it; an obvious and deliberate artistic choice to emphasize that their behaviour is largely petty rebellion. The film never wants you to forget that these are children. It doesn’t ask you to admire or even necessarily root for them, but to understand they’re looking for somewhere to belong and something to belong to after spending their short lives being told they’re lesser. This is not some kind of sophisticated sub-textual reading – it’s made explicit again and again in how the girls are utterly ignorant of the adult lifestyle they’re pretending to emulate. The Cuties are an idea. To Amy, they represent the possibility of being unshackled from traditionalism and conservatism. To social media, they, of course, represent something illicit and salacious, ripe for exploitation – it’s a coincidence that Cuties debuts on the same day as Jeff Orlowski’s docu-drama The Social Dilemma, but not an altogether unhappy one, since they peddle similar ideas about the inherently harmful consumption of personally-tailored debauchery that the internet serves up to those young and naïve enough to swallow it. Of course, for Amy, the internet is a gateway to a realm of experience she can’t properly comprehend but intuits is vastly different from her own. The great tragedy of Cuties is in how profoundly she misinterprets the behaviours she perceives as freeing. There’s also a crushing irony here that makes this film so resistant to the simplistic notion that it’s endorsing one behaviour or condemning another. The fact is that Amy’s experience as a Muslim and as an immigrant is no more or less patriarchal and exploitative than the world of dancing and twerking that she sees as a kind of escapist fantasy. One can’t be traded for the other, but there’d be little point in doing so anyway. It’s a bleak conclusion with a stinging truth to it, and it reinforces the notion that for Amy, growing up, whether it’s too fast or right on schedule, might not ever be enough.

"Sep 9, 2020",positive," No voy a escribir esta reseña ignorando la fuerte controversia pero si voy directo al grano: Netflix la “cagó” bien duro con esta producción. En su repulsivo poster y mercadeo original, la hicieron pasar como algo completamente distinto a lo que es, y posiblemente arruinaron la carrera recién comenzada de su guionista/directora en la forma más estúpida posible. Con eso dicho, Cuties no es solamente una de las mejores películas del año, es una filosa e incómoda introspección sobre crecer, descubrir el mundo y a nosotros mismos desde las edades mas difíciles. Amy (una impresionante Fathia Youssouf) es una niña inmigrante viviendo en Francia con su madre, padre y sus dos hermanos pequeños, en un pequeño apartamento de una zona pobre. Aquí no veremos la torre Eiffel o románticas calles repletas de vida bohemia, sino otra cara poca veces revelada del país europeo en filmes de atracción masiva. A pesar de sus 11 años, Amy ya sabe la única vida que le espera: ser una buena mujer musulmán, digna representante senegalesa, modesta, obediente (primero a sus padres, luego al marido) y callada. Cuando la mueven de un cuarto a otro, Amy descubre que la habitación principal ahora será ocupada por la nueva esposa que su padre consiguió durante su viaje a Senegal, ocasión que su anciana tía aprovechará para finalmente prepararla en los deberes esperados de una joven mujer como ella, incluyendo cocinar platos que agradarán su futuro esposo, sea quien sea. El mundo de Amy comienza a expandirse cuando conoce a Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), una niña de su misma edad viviendo en un piso superior del mismo edificio, que parece ser todo lo contrario a su pequeño entorno. Angelica es parte de un cuarteto de chicas que se hacen llamar “Cuties”, pasando sus días practicando rutinas de baile para un concurso local. Basado en hechos de su propia vida y otras mujeres con experiencias parecidas, Maïmouna Doucouré construye una cruda visión del conflicto eterno que enfrentan las mujeres desde muy temprana edad; la misma sociedad que las sexualiza, las condena por abrazar la atención que reciben de esa sexualizacion. Algo que curiosamente ocurre en estos momentos con el aumento de mujeres uniéndose a plataformas como OnlyFans. Durante décadas, la figura de la mujer ha sido económicamente aprovechada en revistas, películas y el mismo internet pero cuando ellas toman el control, sacando la figura del medio, son tan despreciadas por un sistema que las insulta mientras las llena de dinero. Cuties no llega a ese nivel pero tampoco tiene miedo de exponernos claramente a esos prejuicios. Para Amy, la ropa, los bailes, y la atención que recibe son una liberación que nunca experimentó antes, por lo que hará todo lo posible para no perderlas. Este filme ocurre desde la perspectiva completa de Amy –los pocos personajes masculinos apenas aparecen- dandole enfoque absoluto a su busqueda de indentidad. De ser una niña más dentro del burka, Amy consigue adoración en la forma “me gusta” en redes sociales, que la llevan a buscar formas de extenderlas.  Doucouré usa astutamente los momentos más incomodos para demostrar los peligros del acceso en línea sin supervisar, pero también que el problema es la percepción. Para nosotros los bailes que Amy descubre en internet y les enseña a sus compañeras son imprudentes, para ellas otro juego más, junto a ver quién come más dulces, brincar en la cama, y pelear con comida. Son niñas haciendo estupideces, como hicimos todos. Mientras el asqueroso mercadeo original enfocaba las secuencias de baile en ropas inapropiadas, los momentos más impactantes de Cuties ocurren en el pequeño apartamento, con Amy escondida escuchando el sufrimiento de su madre. En otro momento, su acto desesperado para mantener su móvil, y descubrir la aterrorizante forma en que Amy piensa que puede conseguir lo que quiere. A medida que la boda de su padre se acerca la rebelión de Amy empeora, haciendo imposible vivir los dos mundos al mismo tiempo. Pero a Doucouré no le interesa darnos un final de cuentos de hadas, sino dar una contundente mirada al inescapable sistema atrapando a Amy de una forma u otra; independientemente cual escoja, será controlada por un destino de modestia o un universo de hipócrita desprecio. Crecer no es fácil para nadie pero cualquiera diría que solamente la experiencia de niños es interesante pues nunca había visto algo como Cuties, desde la visión femenina, probando lo mucho que tenemos que aprender.

"Sep 9, 2020",positive," Early on in “Cuties,” Amy (Fathia Youssouf), an 11-year-old Senegalese immigrant living in Paris, hides under a bed and eavesdrops while her mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye), makes a few difficult phone calls. Her husband has decided to marry a second wife, she tells her friends; yes, isn’t that wonderful news? Amy, from her partially obscured vantage, can’t see her mom’s tears, though she can hear the barely disguised anguish in her voice. At the same time, she has perhaps never seen Mariam more clearly, a woman whose long-suffering heart and tough exterior are finally on the verge of breaking. So much of this sharp and clear-eyed debut feature, written and directed by the French filmmaker Maïmouna Doucouré, is about the power, the danger and the limitations of a child’s gaze — everything it can discover, absorb and misinterpret. (It’s also become an unfortunate case study in the adult capacity for misinterpretation, but more on that in a bit.) In a tiny public-housing apartment that’s about to get even smaller, Amy observes the heartbreaking toll of a patriarchal order that has long governed her Muslim family, but which now holds ever less sway and relevance in her life. In another scene, while walking home with her two younger brothers, she catches a captivating glimpse of freedom: four girls her age, rehearsing a routine for an upcoming dance competition. The girls, who call themselves the Cuties, don’t take too kindly to Amy spying on them and begin chucking rocks at her. That assault, much like their suggestive dance moves, is part of their tough-girl act, and an act it very much turns out to be; the Cuties project a lot more confidence, ferocity and real-world savvy than they actually possess. And Amy, despite or perhaps because of her more conservative upbringing, embraces their style, their attitude and most of all their dance moves with an ardor that surprises them and even herself. Not long after she makes her way into the girls’ good graces and their dance crew, Amy’s the one giving them twerking tips and shooting their Instagram content, inspired by provocative online videos that all of them are a bit young to be watching, let alone emulating. The dangers that lie in wait on the internet are an important subject in “Cuties,” but the movie, to its credit, never becomes a reductive cautionary tale. For one thing, Amy’s decisions feel spontaneous and surprising rather than programmed; Youssouf darts through the picture with a vigor, unpredictability and emotional openness that reminded me of nothing so much as one of the Dardenne brothers’ caution-defying young protagonists. For another, no one in Amy’s life — not even her absentee father and least of all her newfound friends — can be reduced to a cardboard antagonist or even a negative influence. (That’s especially true of her closest pal, Angelica, a sympathetic ringleader type played by the irrepressible Médina El Aidi-Azouni.) In a story that’s all about looking and seeing, Doucouré’s own gaze reflects a principled ambivalence: She regards the push-pull of Amy’s existence — her rigid upbringing on one hand and her incipient liberation on the other — with equal parts affection and skepticism. Doucouré, who won a directing prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, has a knack for finding the perfect image again and again: In perhaps the movie’s funniest moment, Amy pulls her hijab over her head during a group prayer meeting and secretly watches a dance video underneath. But while “Cuties” is full of such inspired contrasts between the sacred and the secular, it’s also attuned to the similarities. Amy’s elders, notably a strict auntie (Mbissine Thérèse Diop) tasked with her education, are bent on molding her into an attractive marital prospect. Her dance routines aren’t that much more enlightened, insofar as they, too, cater explicitly to men’s desires. Clothing can be both beautiful and burdensome, whether it’s the traditional blue dress that Amy is expected to wear to her father’s wedding or the tight tank tops and other midriff-baring shirts she and her friends favor at school and on the stage. That’s about as good a segue as I can muster to an unpleasant subject that I wish could be passed over without mention but which nonetheless illustrates why “Cuties” deserves a more thoughtful, intelligent audience than its own distributor seems to expect. Weeks ago, Netflix released a promotional image that sexualized the story’s young protagonists in a way that the movie itself scrupulously avoids doing. Self-styled internet moralists immediately jumped on the film (sight unseen, of course) and called for its removal, essentially likening “Cuties” to child pornography and spurring Netflix to yank the image and apologize for its mistake. Society’s rampant sexualization of preadolescent girls is one topic that Doucouré subjects to tough critical scrutiny; she’s made an empathetic and analytical movie, not an exploitative one. Both her film and the unfortunate contretemps surrounding it make at least two things perfectly clear: A young girl can look at herself, really look at herself, and learn something truthful and powerful from the experience. Some putative grownups, by contrast, can never be bothered to do the hard work of looking at something, let alone learning from it.

"Sep 9, 2020",positive," Its dispiriting (and misleading) American movie trailer aside, the new French film Cuties, from first-time feature director Maïmouna Doucouré, provides a fascinating, complex and disturbing portrait of tween girlhood. The film showcases the genuine unease and identity confusion generated by a society that simultaneously sexualizes children and reacts in horror when those same children embrace their burgeoning sexuality. A civilization that wants to have it both ways on such a fraught issue divests itself of the right to feel outrage, yet the morality police never examine their own sins. Thanks to someone like Doucouré, however, the untenable nature of such a position is made evident. And that’s only part of the story, as Cuties is also about female agency, cultural adaptation and the role that patriarchy plays in all of the above. Though not always a perfectly assured cinematic discussion of its central themes, this vibrant drama, filled with majestic performances from its young stars, succeeds enough as both entertainment and polemic to be well worth watching. Fathia Youssouf plays 11-year-old Amy, whose parents are from Senegal, though she and her mother now live in Paris. Early on, she discovers that her absent father is soon to return with a second, younger wife, a bit of news that she does not digest well (nor does her mom), especially since her older aunt has decided that the upcoming nuptials are an opportunity to train the girl in the ways of being a traditional Senegalese woman. It’s no wonder, then, that when she discovers that female classmates at her new school are practicing dance moves for an upcoming competition, she gravitates to that activity as an escape. Twerking beats cooking any day, it seems. Closest to her is Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), a neighbor in her apartment complex, whose wildness attracts the initially more restrained Amy. Though the other girls are reluctant to let Amy in, her tenacious spirit and knack for choreography eventually wins them over, though there will be many emotional ups and downs, as well as dramatic reversals, along the way. The stakes are so small – it’s but a tiny regional contest coming up – yet they loom enormous in our protagonist’s blossoming gaze, these kids so desperate to matter in this world that they seize hungrily on the readily available images on YouTube and elsewhere, where “likes” equal value, for affirmation. When you have no real power, you take what you can. Though Doucouré occasionally stumbles in the obviousness of her points, she is always perfectly in charge of her actors and her cinematography, presenting scene after scene of genuine emotional charge, framed in striking composition and vivid color. Youssouf is a genuine revelation, the yearning to be something more than what she thinks life has planned for her palpable in every glance and gesture. Perhaps, once this particular misadventure is over, with its lessons learned, her Amy will now be ready to take on the next step of becoming her own woman and breaking the chains imposed on her by both her cultures. The obstacles are large, but at least the film ends on a subtle note that they may be surmountable. Here’s hoping.

"Sep 8, 2020",positive," You probably didn’t hear much about “Cuties” when Maïmouna Doucouré won Best Director in the World Cinema Dramatic competition at this past January’s Sundance Film Festival. I didn’t, and I was there. (Despite recent diversity initiatives, the festival’s attention remains mostly focused on American indies in the main competition, with foreign language films still exiled to sidebar categories.) Too bad, because it’s quite an accomplished debut, inspired by the director’s own experiences growing up poor in Paris as the daughter of Senegalese immigrants. The film follows an 11-year-old Muslim girl who falls in with a fast crowd, acting out and pushing back against her strict, religious upbringing. It’s a thoughtful exploration of adolescent pressures in a hypersexualized society. But chances are if you’ve read anything about “Cuties” lately, it’s been for entirely different reasons. The film — which starts streaming on Netflix Sept 9 — takes its title from a troupe of tween dancers who confound their elders with queasy routines full of twerking, hair-flips and other suggestive stuff that’s these days only socially acceptable during a Super Bowl halftime show. Their climactic performance is deliberately disconcerting and (spoiler) ends in tears, like if the finale of “Little Miss Sunshine” had been played for horror instead of laughs. A couple of weeks ago, Netflix rather stupidly used a still from this scene — with the scantily clad girls striking sultry poses — as the basis of a promotional poster, bringing down a rain of hellfire from all corners of the internet that resulted in death threats for the director and targeted harassment campaigns against defenders of the film. The streaming service quickly apologized and modified their marketing, to little avail. Once outrage goes viral like this, you can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube top. “The only motivation of those who would produce such a film as ‘Cuties’ is to sexualize children and to fuel the appetites of those who would feed on the sexualization of children,” says a statement from something called the Parents Television Council. A Change.org petition originally demanding that the movie be removed from the streaming service on which it had not yet premiered (the text has since been amended) garnered over 600,000 signatures. Sight unseen, “Cuties” has become the bête noire of countless QAnon types and like-minded keyboard crusaders in our current Satanic Panic 2.0 of lunatic conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking rings, with its Black, female, French Senegalese director frequently referred to as “another Hollywood pedo.” (It’s getting pretty crazy out there, folks. Last month a lovely acquaintance I’d always assumed was sane started insisting on Facebook that Tom Hanks became a Greek citizen to escape prosecution for his role in Pizzagate.) I’m reasonably sure that most of these folks who are so angry about a movie they haven’t even watched would never willingly sit through a subtitled film in the first place — especially one featuring so many cast members of color. And that’s an awful shame because, despite some slight missteps we’ll get to later, “Cuties” is a serious film that inspires conversations we really should be having right now about the world in which our young girls are growing up. It’s refreshingly frank about class, religion and burgeoning sexuality in ways mainstream American movies would never dare. And who can blame them, given all that’s happened to this one over the past couple weeks? (It probably goes without saying that “Cuties” opened in France last month to wide acclaim and zero controversy.) Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi stars as young Amy Diop, who recently moved to a Parisian housing project with her mother and two baby brothers. The master bedroom has been locked off because her father has taken a second wife in Senegal, who will soon be arriving for a lavish marriage ceremony, banishing Amy’s mom to one of the children’s rooms. Life is stifling in this tiny apartment. Doucouré shoots in widescreen cinemascope but cramps the characters into frames-within-frames, always walled off by obstructed views through doorways and windows. Then one day, downstairs in the laundry room, Amy discovers freedom. Well actually, it’s just Angelica (Medina El Aidi), a bespectacled dynamo dancing up a storm while ironing her hair. It's the first shot in the movie in which there’s any room to breathe, and Angelica spins and flings her way around every inch of it. Most of the movie chronicles Amy’s attempts to curry favor with Angelica and her gang of so-called Cuties — back-sassing bad girls who strike freeze-frame flash mobs in the schoolyard to drive their teachers crazy and shake their groove things around the projects all afternoon. They talk dirty without really knowing what they’re talking about — one of the less worldly gals mistakes a condom for a balloon and blows it up — pretending to be precocious according to whatever they’ve seen most recently on social media. Amy knows this is all raunchy and wrong yet it feels so invigorating and alive compared to the dutiful drudgery in which her mother and miserable aunt toil subserviently, every choice already made for them by men we never meet. “When I was your age I was already engaged,” scolds Amy’s old-world auntie, who in a sly bit of casting is played by Mbissine Thérèse Diop, star of Ousmane Sembène’s seminal 1966 “Black Girl.” Our heroine swipes her older male cousin’s cell phone, and before long she’s taking duckface selfies in the moonlight, intoxicated by the attention of strangers online. It’s here that Doucouré begins to tread on tricky ground with, I think, extraordinary sensitivity. Amy starts wearing one of her little brother’s T-shirts as a crop-top, and the movie quite delicately toggles between her newfound empowerment at finally being looked at by boys and the shame she feels after being objectified. Sexuality can be a scary, complicated thing when you’re young and it’s only gotten a thousand times messier thanks to the internet. “Cuties” could easily have become either a cautionary afterschool special or an irreverent, anti-religious screed, but instead it’s a rare movie that understands the profound ambivalence of adolescence. Liberation brings its own discontents, and power balances are always in flux. Sometimes it stumbles. Doucouré includes a strange, magic realist tangent in which the traditional formal dress Amy’s supposed to wear at her father’s wedding seems to be endowed with supernatural powers, occasionally knocking on the closet door to interrupt conversations, and its fabric appears to start menstruating when she does. (Nope. No idea.) The final shot is a great way to end a movie but I’m not sure it’s a great way to end this movie, considering all that’s come before. Yet for every such slip, there’s a wonderful scene like one in which Amy — having recently been ridiculed by her friends for having a “flat butt” — hides under her hijab during a prayer service, surreptitiously watching a tawdry twerking video on her phone. Afterward, she studies the well-rounded rear ends of her mother and the other women at the mosque, a knowing smile spreading wide across her face. The film actually has a lot in common with last summer’s uproarious “Good Boys,” a sort of “Superbad” junior about three naive sixth-graders bluffing their way through assorted adult situations. The R-rated comedy was a modest hit without inspiring much in the way of condemnation, probably in part because they’re boys, and it feels like there's less at stake than there is in “Cuties.” Doucouré is asking us to think long and hard about the kind of behavior our young girls are being taught to emulate, and who they’re really performing for. But these are tough conversations I worry a lot of people won't want to have right now, especially when it's so much easier to just judge a film by its poster."
"Sep 3, 2020",positive," The direct treatment of childhood sexuality—especially girls’ sexuality—on film is an ethical minefield. The moving image and desire are so closely associated, the relation between cinema and the voyeuristic male gaze so firmly entrenched, and the assault of young girls such a persistent threat, that even a hint of a sexualized pre-teen body is apt to provoke reaction. Despite whatever outrage was stirred (or drummed) up before its release, though, writer-director Maïmouna Doucouré’s Cuties navigates a path through a middle-school girl’s self-awakening that feels neither artificially “safe” nor exploitative. Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is the daughter of Senegalese immigrants living in Paris, and her teenage angst kicks in hard when she overhears her mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye), tearfully discussing with her aunt (Mbissine Thérèse Diop) that the girl’s father will be returning from Senegal with a second wife. Already fascinated by the stylish and insolent four-girl dance troupe that dominates the social life of her school, Amy begins rebelling against her family’s conservative Islamic traditions by hiding crop tops and short skirts under her modest hoodies and jeans, stealing a cousin’s cellphone to engage with her peers’ social media-heavy lifestyle, and practicing hip-hop dance moves in the bathroom mirror. Amy also insistently integrates herself into the multi-ethnic dance troupe, which calls itself the Cuties. She lurks around them in the schoolyard, spies on the dance practices that they hold under a grimy highway overpass, and continues to quietly elbow her way into the group even after Jess (Ilanah Cami-Grousolas) pelts her with a stone. The shy, socially awkward Amy is an odd match for the brash group of girls who appear to have modeled themselves after Bratz dolls, and they bully her over her initial attempts to merely stand in their proximity. One of the Cuties, Angelica (Medina El Aidi-Azouni), lives in the same apartment complex as Amy, and she secures for her neighbor a formal entrée to the clique as their videographer. After Angelica has a beef with Yasmine (Myriam Hamma), Amy demonstrates that she’s learned the dance routine and secures a spot as Yasmine’s replacement in advance of a tryout for a local competition. It’s a slot that spells conflict with her mother and aunt, who expect her to help with the conventional women’s duties in preparation for her father’s wedding. Doucouré has a remarkable grasp of the irrationality and volatility of middle-school social dynamics. Scenes like the one in which Angelica and Amy bond over how many gummy bears they can stuff into their mouths, or one in which the five girls collectively fumble and titter nervously through a video chat with the boy who Angelica has a crush on, capture the odd mental and emotional space pre-teens occupy between childhood and adolescence. The film’s subject matter puts one on guard that it might oversell capitalist consumption and sexualization of the female body as liberation; Amy’s newfound love of tight, eye-catching skirts and second-hand crop tops recalls the grotesque scene in Sex and the City 2 in which women from the UAE doff their burkas to reveal the latest couture clothing underneath. One early scene in Cuties even sees Amy hiding within her burka during prayer at her mosque, in order to watch hip-hop videos featuring dancers wearing g-strings on her stolen phone. The difference between Cuties and the conservative fantasy of the liberated woman-consumer, though, is that the former is actually told from the perspective of an immature, subaltern woman trying to figure out which pieces of which culture suit her. It’s a critique both of the Senegalese patriarchy that tells Amy to be a docile and modest future wife and of the Western patriarchal ideology that tells her that the primary avenue of a woman’s self-expression is through her sexuality. A rushed and undersold conclusion to this culture clash notwithstanding, Cuties is an admirable and empathetic portrait of girlhood in a world defined by post-colonialism, digitized social practices, and, not least, the imperative to twerk.

"Sep 1, 2020",positive," They say there’s no such thing as bad publicity. They lie. Consider the case of French-Senegalese director Maïmouna Doucouré’s touching, observant coming-of-age drama Cuties, about an 11-year-old Muslim girl who joins an all-girl dance group. The film, which won an award at Sundance earlier this year and was picked up for distribution by Netflix, recently found itself at the center of controversy when a poster seemed to sexualize its very young characters, featuring them in tight clothes and weirdly suggestive poses. (The ad was a new one, apparently created by Netflix, who promptly removed the image — albeit after the damage was done.) The movie was condemned sight unseen by many online, even as those who’d actually viewed the film insisted that it was in no way exploitative. Since then, perhaps unsurprisingly, the anti-Cuties cause has also been embraced by various trolls and conspiracy nuts; I’ve heard from a couple of defenders of the film that they’ve been targeted for harassment. Even so, on the surface, you’d think that this controversy might prove to the picture’s ultimate benefit, turning it from a foreign-language obscurity (the kind of movie that tends to get lost on Netflix) to a must-see flash point. And Cuties certainly deserves to be seen. But it’s also a delicate work that strikes a very careful balance in its portrait of the world, and that balance is upset if a viewer is more worried about social propriety than the truth of lived experience. Our hero, Amy (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi), is a Senegalese immigrant who resides with her mother and two younger siblings in a small Parisian apartment where the main bedroom has now been declared off-limits — Amy’s father, we learn, has taken on a second wife, and the room is being prepared and decorated for them by Amy’s poor overworked mother. In one of the film’s most agonizing moments, Amy hides under a bed while she eavesdrops on her mother talking on the phone, informing friends and family of her husband’s new wife. Mom speaks bemusedly and casually about the matter with others, but whimpers inconsolably in between calls, the bed shaking as she beats herself; taught that an unhappy or straying husband is the measure of a wife’s failure, she blames herself. All we see during this scene are mom’s feet: Doucouré often frames Amy’s home life in tight, constrained spaces — blocked off by walls, corridors, and doors, the imagery embodying the sense of emotional suffocation. It is in this context — a devout, constrained, and impoverished world where women are told there are more of them than men in hell, and that their duties are first and foremost to their spouses — that Amy discovers her upstairs neighbor Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni), whom she first sees energetically dancing in their apartment building’s laundry room. We don’t see Angelica’s face at first, and the reveal when she finally turns, that this girl in tight leather jeans and bright-red tank top is basically a child the same age as Amy, comes as a jolt. Angelica belongs to a quartet of popular girls at school who, calling themselves the “Cuties,” strut through the corridors in age-inappropriate clothing, try to act like grown-ups, and practice their dance moves for an upcoming competition which will pit them against the Sweety-Swaggs, a group of older (though still noticeably young) girls. The Cuties are terrific dancers, but their act is ridiculous given their age. And they don’t actually know anything about the ways of adults — their childish banter reveals they have no idea how sex works, and a scene where one of them finds a used condom, blows it up, and pretends it’s a breast implant results in chaotic, cringeworthy hijinks, like something out of a high-concept Hollywood comedy such as Good Boys. To the submerged, infinitely curious Amy, however, the Cuties represent liberation and belonging. (That most of these girls appear to be, like her, the children of immigrants is unremarked upon, but perhaps worth noting.) She embraces her newfound friends with the fervor of a fresh convert — commandeering her young brother’s T-shirt to use as a tank top and stealing her older cousin’s cell phone to shoot the Cuties’ routines and post videos on social media, where the cruder the dance moves, the more likes one gets. The internet and its salacious images fascinate Amy. At one point, during a prayer session, she takes the hijab covering her head and pulls it completely over herself, then watches a half-naked twerking music video in her newfound privacy. Right after the prayers, she sits in the corner and observes the ample bottoms of the women around her as they go about their business, as if she’s just discovered something strange and secret about the world. Cuties is filled with honest moments like this. It’s also filled with horror. During a fight with her older male cousin, Amy suddenly starts to undress. The cousin is instantly mortified and pushes her away, but the tragedy isn’t so much in the action as in the thought: Amy now believes this is how she can get out of a tough situation. It would have been easy for Doucouré to use a broad brush to paint the different extremes of Amy’s experience (“stifling tradition bad, dancing good”), but she’s not exactly making Footloose here. Cuties is not a blunt screed or a finger-wagging cautionary tale in either direction — which is one reason why anyone watching the film looking for clear messages about right and wrong is bound to be disappointed, maybe even outraged. Doucouré appears to be a far too sensitive director for that kind of polemic. Instead, she subtly juxtaposes Amy’s two worlds to show us that they have certain things in common: All that awkward gyrating and twerking itself exists in a universe as much dominated by male expectation as the strict milieu the girl is ostensibly fleeing — Amy is simply trading in one form of subsumed patriarchy for another. That doesn’t mean, however, that the dancing isn’t fun, or freeing, or that the Cuties don’t help Amy gain a sense of herself. Nor does it mean that there is no love or warmth for her at home, or in her Senegalese community. When a lovely blue traditional dress arrives for Amy, she looks at it admiringly, until she realizes that she is supposed to wear it to her father’s wedding. After that, the dress looms in her closet, both alluring and terrifying — a warning that the future contains both beauty and heartbreak, and very few correct answers."
"Aug 25, 2020",positive," Right-wingers are accusing Maïmouna Doucouré’s “Cuties” of sexualizing young girls, thanks to a bad Netflix gaffe, but the film itself provides a nuanced examination of girlhood. Maïmouna Doucouré’s Cuties, available on Netflix from September 9, has been met with the ire of the religious right, as well as a wider online public that believes that the film sexualizes children. To be fair, the poster Netflix initially chose to promote the French film, which won the World Cinema Directing Award at Sundance in 2019, was a grossly inappropriate choice—one that decontextualized a scene from the film in order to promote a movie about the complexities of growing up in both modest and modern cultures at once. Netflix has taken the image down but, despite outcry, is continuing with the release of the film.  People across the political spectrum have expressed rightful concern about the streaming giant’s choice of a photo of twerking pre-teen girls in revealing outfits as a way to garner interest in the film, and Netflix has accepted responsibility for the misstep. But calls for the film’s release to be canceled altogether are deeply misguided and reactionary. Cuties is precisely about the too-easy ways we choose to condemn and isolate children as they take risks and make mistakes growing up, no matter their cultural backgrounds. And the film has a major lesson for religious conservatives and moral panickers about what fear, condemnation, and emotional neglect can do to the young people who turn to us for guidance in the midst of turbulent personal awakenings. In Cuties, Aminata, or Amy, is a 14-year-old French-Senegalese girl of Muslim faith. Her family has just moved to Paris, but her father, still in Senegal, has decided to take on a new wife. Amy sees her mother visibly shaken by the development, and secretly witnesses her hit herself in response to her pain about the marriage and her obligation to pretend she welcomes it. As the family prepares for the wedding, Amy begins to cross over from a period of childhood innocence within her Muslim community to the demands of becoming a woman, both in the religious context, in which teens marry, as well as in modern Paris, where teens post flirtatiously on social media and wear crop tops and short-shorts.  At her new school, Amy sees a group of audacious girls stage a flash mob during which all the kids in the schoolyard suddenly freeze into various poses. The principal is visibly shaken by the benign action, as well as the girls’ coquettish outfits including form-fitting dresses and flashy purses. As she drags them to class they scream at her, “What about freedom of expression?!” Indeed.  Amy, for her part, boldly seeks acceptance into the group after she sees them practicing a dance routine at an abandoned railway track. The Cuties, as they call their dance group, reject and bully Amy before embracing her dance skills. They’re not the kindest or most tolerant bunch, but they offer Amy a dose of an imaginative, risk-taking life; one that does not shirk from curiosity and connection, but runs after it, no matter the price. The most emotionally caring of the girls, Angelica, lives in Amy’s building, and they bond over the isolation they feel in their families, as well as their growing estrangement from their parents, who seem too busy and too disapproving to engage their interests. Instead, these girls must navigate their love of expression alone; of course, in a world marked by the exploitation of women of all ages and within all cultures, they stumble.  Doucouré’s film rigorously examines the ways teen girls mimic the images they see on social media, the ones that tell them their bodies are all wrong, their presentation too childish, their lives unremarkable. But instead of preaching to children on the basis of fear, Doucouré is willing to look frankly at what is so appealing about lascivious dancing to girls too young to understand sex even on a very fundamental level. The Cuties find a kind of power in their movement and have very little insight into the wider context of their self-sexualization. Yet, instead of listening and speaking to these young girls, asking them about their interests and figuring out how to support them in ways that don’t threaten their ability to be children, the adults around them mostly respond with shame and rejection.  Only one elder within Amy’s community is able to see through her transgressions initially—not only the sexualized dancing and dressing, but also a violent act she commits at school against a student who harasses her—and addresses the root of the rebellion. This elder connects Amy’s pain to her mother’s pain, her lashing out to her mother’s inability to continue to shoulder the burden of what seems to be a deeply one-sided marriage. He looks at Amy, spends time with her, and concludes that “there is no evil or devil” within the child, but perhaps a need for Amy’s mother to know that she can liberate herself from a marriage that does not offer her love or freedom.  “This desire for social purity, to protect oneself from the corruption of the outside, is not confined to the right or to the religious. Anyone who has been on the left long enough can tell stories of joining or encountering a highly insular group that refused to work with anyone who did not subscribe to all of their tenets. It is all too easy to convince ourselves that if only our group can be kept pure and committed, we can become strong enough to go out and change the world. This is where I think the Christian doctrine of original sin has something to teach the left. We can never externalize evil; we can’t simply gather the ‘right’ group of people, because we ourselves are not right.” Doucouré’s Cuties takes this doctrine to heart, criticizing the multiple layers of societal exploitation and coercion that impose surveillance on girls rather than meet them with the compassion and openness that could actually extinguish such exploitation. To refuse the opportunity to hear this message is only to perpetuate the problems all the outrage around the film claims to reject. "
"Apr 24, 2020",neutral," The internet can be a scary place. Access to information doesn’t just mean a democratized digital space - it also means more access to danger and harm. When raising young children in the internet age, who and what can influence them has expanded more than ever before. It’s jarring to come to terms with this, but Maïmouna Doucouré’s film Cuties challenges the audience to do so. Earnest performances from the assemble cast and Doucouré’s deliberately voyeuristic direction showcases the perils and plights of coming of age in the digital era. Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is an 11-year-old French Sengalese girl, struggling to grow into who she is. Her mother is hit with news of her father taking a second wife, throwing the family into preparation for their wedding celebration. Downtrodden, she looks to find friendship with a group of popular tween dancers, who call themselves “cuties.” While she and the “cuties” practice to compete in a dance competition, she begins to grow increasingly rebellious. Going against her religious values, Amy continues to spiral in a volatile way.  Amy finds herself warring with her conservative Muslim upbringing while seeking the freedom the “cuties” represent. Typically in a hoodie and T-shirts, she starts wearing her younger brother’s shirt and fashions it into a crop top. Eventually, she steals money to buy more fashionable crop tops, heeled clogs, liquid leggings, and other Limited Too-esque outfits. This escalates into buying lingerie for her and her new friends, desperate to kick the “baby” image.  Despite the “cuties” wanting you to think they’re mature, Doucouré reminds you constantly in the screenplay their age. The interactions they have between other people in the film - like older classmates - serve as a heat check that no matter their insistence, these are children so act accordingly. Doucouré pairs this reminder with close tracking shots while the girls practice dancing. The closeness of the camera while these children attempt to dance sensually is very uncomfortable to witness. But that’s the objective; it reinforces how over-sexualized girls like them have been. In particular Black girls, who have commonly been told they’re “hot in the pants” or “too grown” starting at this age. The onus is put on the audience (the adults in the room, literally) to look away while these girls are trying to figure themselves out.  Eventually, Amy’s mother finds out what’s going on and confronts her. “Who are you, Amy?” she screams in an explosive scene that ends in tears and holy water. The actions were certainly excessive but ultimately a hard lesson in trying to find a place in Amy’s world. With access to a phone, she now had adult dancers to inspire her dance moves, friends to inspire her looks, and photos to inspire her bad decision-making. Cuties ends as heartbreaking as it does hopeful. Amy has plenty of life left to live to reverse the mistakes she’s made. But in an age of influence, society is not doing a good job protecting these girls and influencing them for the better. Joi Childs is a brand marketer, freelance writer, and sarcasm enthusiast.

"Feb 3, 2020",positive," Maïmouna Doucouré has a lot on her mind in the French film Cuties, but her own beliefs are more opaque about the topics which clearly fascinate her. She certainly gives her 11-year-old protagonist Amy (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi) quite a bit to deal with, with the exact nature of her fears only revealed at the very end, where it finally becomes clear just who will be Amy’s saving grace in the labyrinth of contrasting expectations which awaits her rapidly approaching womanhood. The more immediate nature of what awaits Amy is revealed to her only through happenstance, as she and her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) await her father’s return from Senegal. By eavesdropping on a series of adult conversations, Amy learns the true nature of her father’s absence, which involves taking a second wife, who will soon be residing with them in their apartment.  Such developments would send the best of us into an emotional tailspin, but Amy also has to witness Mariam’s pain and humiliation from what the other women see as her duty, which involves calling others in the community to cheerily announce the news, and preparing the food for the wedding, which will occur at their own home. All the while, her local mosque preaches modesty and obedience while warning of the Hell which awaits those who disobey. Such a repressive environment tends to birth extremes, and sure enough, Amy is drawn to a dance group at her school which not only offers escape, but an outlet to express the emotions her stoic culture forbids her from voicing. With all the zeal of a convert, Amy is soon leading the other girls into increasingly provocative dance routines, and taking actions that soon appall even her new friends, who are already eager to sexualize themselves.  In another movie, they’d be symbolic of a generation’s over-sexualization and victimization, but Cuties would rather explore the preteen dynamics Doucouré has a keen eye for with an interesting addition of some magical realism. It’s not without some discomfort though, as the camera zooms right in on the girls in a fashion far more suited to adult women, which couldn’t be anything other than cringy. At least the film doesn’t pretend that any of the various cultures Amy is struggling to navigate will ever do right by her, although it does offer another way between extremes, where perhaps true freedom can be found. Cuties competed in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and is currently seeking distribution. Doucouré was awarded the Directing Award: World Cinema Dramatic Award for Cuties. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them.

"Feb 3, 2020",positive," Puberty, especially for many pre-teen and teenage girls, is often full of contradictions. They’re objectified and handled with gloves, they’re expected to act older and younger than they are, they’re prodded and shamed and pushed in conflicting directions—often at a whim—when seemingly every decision they make is chastised. Societal pressure, whether it’s through their family, their friends, their classmates, the media they consume, or even the instant gratification of social media, is all-consuming. And for Amy (Fathia Youssouf)—the 11-year-old at the center of Cuties—all of that is laid bare as it starts to deconstruct those contradictions. An 11-year-old girl attending a new school in Paris befriends a group of girls—who are trying to win a local dance competition—as puberty,  and a clash of ideals between her friends and family emerge. Like many girls around her age, Amy dons a different persona, both with her outfits and her demeanor, depending on who she’s with. After she and her family move into an apartment in a poor Paris neighborhood, she’s expected to look after her younger siblings and help her mother Mariam dutifully prepare for her husband’s wedding to his second wife when they arrive from Senegal. Their tightknit Muslim community largely sees the wedding as a blessing and expects them to welcome the new family with open arms. At school, she becomes fascinated by “the Cuties,” a group of girls who act out and wear revealing clothing. Under the train tracks, the Cuties practice dance moves in hopes of winning a local competition, and while those girls are as close as friends can be, that friendship can be picked up or dropped on a whim; they each have the capacity to wield that cruelty like a sharpened knife and jam it where it hurts most. Amy is a constant witness, whether she’s processing her rage in silence as she glimpses the mask her mother wears slip for the briefest of moments or watching the Cuties practice their dance routine from afar; she’s expected to fit in a certain box, and she’s punished if she strays outside of it. It’s not until Amy starts utilizing a smartphone she obtains (and keeps a secret from her family) that she starts paving her own way; she even contributes more moves to the dance routine to make their dance even more provocative. But she also finds out the hard way the hypocrisy that is being a girl on the cusp of discovering who she is. She’s continually haunted by the dress she’s supposed to wear to her father’s wedding and everything that represents, and as she heads on that downward spiral, she’s unrecognizable to just about everyone who knows her; at times, the melodramatics of the situation lean into the absurd and border on implausible. Written and directed by Maïmouna Doucouré (whose script won a Sundance Institute Global Filmmaking Award in 2017), Cuties nails down just how isolating and uncomfortable being a young girl in the world can be, elevated largely by Youssouf’s performance. Amy—and so many girls out there, really—are judged and shamed for wearing too much clothing, wearing too little clothing, wearing the wrong type of clothing, for the way they dance, for not accepting everything at face value or with a smile, for chasing that high on social media, and for what they post. They’re expected to act like adults and children all at once, but when faced with one reality of children acting like adults, it’s downright uncomfortable. At one point, Amy lays two very different outfits on a bed, the two sides of her double life, that almost look like they could’ve been made from the same cloth. The metaphor is hamfisted and it takes some clunky maneuvering to get there, but the message—while muddied—gets across just the same. Still not sure what to watch tonight?

"Jan 30, 2020",positive," It could be argued that Amy (Fathia Youssouf) and her friends spend the entirety of “Cuties” in a place they should not be, but at one point somewhat late in the film, a male security guard catches them in a moment of physical trespass, kicking them out of the club they’ve snuck into and the girls, no more than 11 or 12, are savvy enough to call his authority into question by screaming “pedophile” at the top of their lungs, bringing his boss into the mix to calm the situation down. Even at their precocious age, the quartet are well-aware of how the world works, but struggle with their place in it, a contradiction which may have been explored in countless coming-of-age tales, but rarely as boldly as in Maïmouna Doucouré’s startling feature debut. While Catherine Hardwicke’s “Thirteen” comes to mind, Doucouré eschews a gritty aesthetic in favor of a subtly surreal one for the story of the young Amy, who has recently resettled in a new flat with her mother Mariam and two younger siblings, waiting for their father to join them. With Mariam rarely at home, presumably working to keep a roof over their head, Amy looks to find friends at school and for better or worse, locates Coumba, Jess and Angelica, who stand out on the schoolyard for the brawls they’re inclined to start, and as she grows a rebellious streak upon learning inadvertently that her father’s absence is due to bringing home a second wife from Senegal, she fights her way into the group quite literally, becoming a crucial part of their aspirations to win a dance crew competition. Although their routines are fierce, “Cuties” suggests the young women are moving far too fast, clad in skintight outfits and gyrating in highly-sexualized choreography that they couldn’t even begin to fully comprehend its origin from seeing it on YouTube, though the influence of the Kardashians, namechecked at one point, has clearly reached all the way to France. The much more pernicious cultural root of this, however, is largely left offscreen as you realize that while men can do as they please, whether it’s Amy’s father running around in Senegal or her young brother Ismael, who floods the apartment thinking it would be fun to turn it into a pool, no such avenues exist for women, expected only to serve as sexual objects or to care for any resulting children, and Doucouré brilliantly articulates Amy’s search for direction into an painful binary choice, either staying the religious path her mother has taken, which has left her bound to a husband that doesn’t return her care and consideration, or leaning into sexual objectification where it seems like there’s some liberation in bold outfits and attitude. Of course, each can quickly become their own prison and by the time “Cuties” reaches a climatic dance scene, which is right up there with the shower scene in “Psycho” in skillfully avoiding anything specifically obscene, but sure to fuel some nightmares, Doucouré has locked up the audience up in it, turning into truly transfixing cinema. Worrying that its central characters are acting beyond their years, you marvel at how the filmmaker directs beyond what should be expected of a debut feature, eliciting remarkable performances from her young cast and carefully establishing the slightly heightened world “Cuties” exists in, offering a powerful plea for society to step up its game as well. “Cuties” will screen at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24th at 9 am at the Library Center Theatre in Park City and 9 pm at the Salt Lake City Library Theatre, January 25th at 6 pm at the Sundance Mountain Resort Screening Room in Park City, January 29th at 6 pm at the Temple Theatre in Park City and January 31st at 1 pm at the Redstone Cinema 2 in Park City."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive," Sure to be a crowd-pleaser for its joyous scenes of a group of eleven-year-old girls dancing, Cuties is an often compelling if somewhat under-baked look at how girls end up becoming over-sexualized at a young age. Cuties follows Amy, a Senegalese immigrant new to Paris, who is caught between her devoutly religious family in upheaval — her father has just taken a second wife and has yet to join them in France — and her desire to be part of a group of French girls at school who love to dance.  Maïmouna Doucouré’s feature debut often feels inspired by Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood, which follows a teenage girl, Marieme, seeking community. Both use shot-reverse-shot techniques to show us the desirable group that the protagonist wants to belong to — often glimpsed dancing — and the lonely protagonist staring at them in awe. While Sciamma explored Marieme’s struggle with performing femininity and masculinity while seeking freedom from oppression, Doucouré’s Cuties explores how young girls are sexualized, often by choice but without understanding the consequences of this sexualization. In Cuties, Doucouré constantly highlights the disconnect between the girls’ awareness of their own sexuality and how they’re perceived. When we meet Amy’s first friend, she’s in tight pleather pants, a tiny top, her hips swaying to the music, and her long hair covering her face; it comes as a shock that she’s so young when her face is revealed. In a key scene, a member of the group picks up a condom off the street and starts blowing into it like a balloon, unaware of what she’s touching. At the same time, the girls wear tight clothing, often with low necks and bare midriffs, and perform increasingly sexually suggestive choreography. Despite many closeups of the girls’ bottoms as they dance, Doucouré avoids any kind of leering gaze, instead celebrating the girls’ rhythmic athleticism with a weary eye to how problematic this could be. Unfortunately, Doucouré’s exploration of what’s driving the girls to want to present as sexualized adults so young is undercooked. Certainly, it’s partly curiosity, and there’s a great scene in which Amy watches the rear ends of a group of women in her building, shot from her height, after being made fun of by her friends for having a non-existent derriere. We also sense that Amy’s father may have taken a second wife to satisfy sexual desires, but since this is never made explicit, it’s unlikely Amy understands this.  Despite its flaws, Cuties proves that Doucouré has a keen eye for keeping us in the children’s perspective, and that leads to some wonderfully nuanced moments. Amy first discovers her father is taking a second wife when hiding under her mother’s bed. Her grandmother is bullying her mother into making this news known, and we watch that power play occur through Amy’s eyes, in the way the grandmother’s feet push towards the mother and invade her space. When Amy’s mother cries, Amy cries, understanding her life is changing, but perhaps not what all the implications of that are."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Doucouré's film will surely draw conversations as more people see it. Those who even disagree with some of her decisions will find it hard to get these timely themes and ideas out of their heads, thus proving it to be an effective film."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive," Throughout the world, the pain, suffering and voices of little girls are often ignored and silenced. French filmmaker Maïmouna Doucouré’s debut film Cuties (Mignonnes) is an arresting assessment of the hyper-sexualization of young girls and grapples with the juxtaposition of this issue in a society where women are becoming increasingly sexually liberated. The bold and disquieting film follows Amy, an 11-year old girl who moves with her mother and young brothers from Senegal to a jam-packed Paris housing project. While her mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye), has become preoccupied with the devastating news that her husband has taken a second wife, Amy is left to parent her younger siblings. This includes everything from watching them, feeding them and doing the grocery shopping for the household. Similar to films like Beasts of the Southern Wild, Crooklyn and Eve’s Bayou, Doucouré shines a light on how quickly Black girls are expected to stand in and complete tasks typically ascribed to adults. In contrast, little Black boys often basque in the attentions of their mothers, free of such expectations. Though her mother has raised her as a devout, conservative Muslim, Amy soon gets her hands on an iPhone and begins to emulate the more provocative images of women she sees online and in music videos. An outcast in her plain clothing and large Afro puff, Amy soon finds herself fascinated with her classmate, Angelica, a Latinx girl who wears her slick straight hair and quick temper as armor. Angelica is fearless and volatile–the queen bee of her friend group that’s dubbed themselves the Cuties. Eager to garner Angelica’s attention and earn her place on the Cuties crew, Amy begins wearing her brother’s t-shirts as crop-tops while intensely studying the Cuties’ mannerisms and behaviors. What starts as an innocent desire to fit in and have a place in her new environment becomes a cautionary tale for not just young girls, but for the rest of the world that has decided that young girls (especially young girls of color) aren’t worthy of protection. When the Cuties sign up for a community dance competition where they are set to compete against a group of older girls, Amy seizes the opportunity. She meticulously practices the Cuties’ dance choreography, strategically placing herself in Angelica’s good graces before winning her spot in the group, even at the expense of another girl. Cuties is difficult to watch. As Amy and her friends shake, grind and gyrate in the camera, wearing belly tops and booty shorts, Doucouré forces her audience to sit in a paralyzing state of fear. It is deeply uncomfortable to watch prepubescent girls behave in this manner.  Shot in one of Paris’ most impoverished neighborhoods, which is rarely seen on the big screen, Doucouré shoots Amy and her crew in bold, bright colors under the beaming Paris sun. The Cuties are vibrant and vivacious; it’s the predatory men who sexualize them who are terrifying. Cuties quickly shifts to a tone of breathless terror whenever any man appears in the frame, as it is unclear how their presence will impact the girls and women. This nervousness is most acute when observing Mariam’s willingness to bend to her husband’s commands and how this helps to shape Amy’s understanding of a woman’s place in society. Through her mother’s actions, she is socialized on how to contain and confine her own wishes, becoming someone she doesn’t recognize. During one powerful scene, Amy hides under the bed, listening to her distraught mother weep over her father’s betrayal by taking a new wife. In the next breath, Amy witnesses Mariam gleefully chat about the marriage as if her gut-wrenching sobs never happened. In that pretending and emotional constraint, Amy learns that her feelings and needs are invalid. "
"Jan 27, 2020",positive," SUNDANCE 2020 FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW! Cuties is a bold, coming-of-age drama about 11-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf) in her tween years entering womanhood as a Senegalese Muslim who has moved into a low-income French apartment building in a bustling city with her mother and two younger brothers. As a feature directorial debut for director and writer Maïmouna Doucouré, Cuties is a contemporary view into a fundamental change of life in a modern world of unknown circumstances and how to survive them. Bookending Cuties with traditional Senegalese music, Doucouré presents a harbinger for transformation, giving an inferred nod to time and place. Confronted by a conservative religion, which allows for polygamy, and, of course, male domination, Amy becomes engaged by her flamboyant and rabble-rouser neighbor Angelica, whose “mean girl” posse puts Amy’s sexuality and social awareness into full gear. We meet Angelica listening to modern music, dancing while doing laundry, straightening her hair with an iron on an ironing board, and appearing as if she exists in a far more appealing life than that of Amy. Modest, curious, and with slight ire, Amy becomes curious and pursues her need for acceptance, especially for the girl’s dance group, “The Cuties.” Desperate to compete in a dance competition, “The Cuties” eventually bring in Amy and kick out an existing member who proves her position by offering twerking and other sexually explicit moves for these young girls to perform. Aware of how these types of dance moves and actions are pervasive throughout social media and culture, but unaware of how offensive this style is for such young budding souls, the girls, nonetheless, pursue a competitive spirit. It is of note how these young actresses deliver this transformation and hold on to their dominance quite believably throughout the film. Among the many awkward trials of adolescence, Doucouré contrasts Amy’s life awakening with her mother Mariam’s (Maïmouna Gueyedes) despair due to her husband and father of her children taking a second wife along with an aunt’s stoic stance on the traditional role of a Senegalese Muslim woman. With modern life and traditional values clashing, Amy fully immerses herself in rebel behavior. Dressing scantily, stealing her cousin’s cell phone and her mother’s money, bullying others, and taking on challenges that the audience knows will lead to utter embarrassment. But Doucouré has comic relief when needed as girls will be girls bonding over dancing, shopping, and boys. Yet in a world of rampant and explicit sexuality at every corner, the girls are ultimately left to despair in a dance program that is denounced, bringing Amy to a sense of reality. The performance of Fathia Youssouf is impressive as she transforms her diminutive, naïve self into a towering force. From practicing dance moves in a tiny bathroom to eventually accepting her teenage befuddlement and precociousness as she endures complete humiliation in public and on social media. Learning difficult, hard life-lessons and watching her mother’s own acceptance as well as recognizing her unconditional love, Amy is jumping in joy, as if being freed, as Cuties concludes.

"Jan 26, 2020",positive," After putting the finishing touches on hand-cut, homemade arts and crafts project for her mother, 11-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf), and her younger brother, start arguing over who gets the bigger bedroom of their new apartment. They are told that the room is not for either of them. It is never explained why; at least, not directly to the children. Maïmouna Doucouré’s “Cuties,” which was acquired by Netflix ahead of its Sundance debut, is a vibrant portrait of self discovery, a realist exercise in expressive empathy that doubles as a cautionary tale on the dangers of vanity. It’s a radically different spin on a coming-of-age narrative like Amazon’s “Troop Zero,” only from the kids-who-want-to-be-cool’s perspectives, rather than the picked-on outcasts, which might be less interesting were it not for the extreme difference in social economy, ethnic upbringing, and Doucouré’s raw and intricate eye as a filmmaker.  Amy is the kind of girl who tries so hard to fit in, she sometimes ends up alienating herself further by extension. Her family has recently arrived in Paris from Senegal and she lives a fairly conversative life, praying to Allah and partaking in group prayer with the rest of her community, repeatedly reminded of her pious duties and lectured on taboo behavior. One day, Amy spots one of her neighbors, Angelica, twerking her heart out in the laundry room, sporting a crop top and leather pants while ironing her hair. Amy’s eyes go wide. Angelica is the head of a schoolyard dance clique, who have dubbed themselves the “Cuties.” After witnessing a frozen flash mob, Amy instantly becomes enamored with their behavior, enviously following the girls to watch them practice by the train tracks, shooting videos on their phones to upload for Instagram views. But Amy is too poor to afford a cell phone, and her family would never allow one anyway. When an opportunity presents itself, Amy swipes a phone from a local day laborer, working on the vacant apartment room. Practicing her moves in front of her mirror, Amy inserts herself as a Cutie member after earning some likes, but the young lady’s addiction to social media grows obsessive as the group prepares for a dance competition. “Cuties” is bursting at the seams with strong ideas through a sharply made vision, thought it chooses not to address some of its most (deliberately) discomforting aspects with any kind of direct discussion, in an effort to represent all the important conversations so many parents never actually sit down to have with their children, perhaps. Most kids live in their own world, too blissfully innocent to grasp the concept of long term repercussions. Doucouré’s film appears more concerned with exploring the consequences a bunch of selfie practice sessions might have, as opposed to sitting down for an actual talk about the potentially vainglorious pitfalls.Several of the most stand-out sequences are euphorically cathartic, liberating and celebratory, basking in the glory of feminine empowerment in the same way that movies like “The Bling Ring,” or “Hustlers” have, but the fallout of the Cuties consumerist actions don’t have direct legal repercussions, so much as psychological ones. Kids can be mean, really mean, and “Cuties,” isn’t afraid to show ignorant pre-teens uncanny ability to traumatize each other, as giggly gummy bear eating contests turn into life or death playground shoving matches, but it also never stops to say to the kids at its center, “Hey, life doesn’t really work that way.” The aesthetic craft is subtly resonant, but, structurally, too elliptical for its own good, the screenplay telegraphing conflicts some viewers will see coming from a mile away, while withholding vital info. The purposeful refusal to have any kind of conversation, to craft an insular narrative — to show rather than tell — is a bold one, though not entirely successful. The domestic stakes are a good example: the first 5 to 10 minutes establishes the oppressive side of Amy’s religious life, but then never really returns to what is prohibited until the climax, outside one scene which finds her stealth watching sensual videos of women twerking in sexually lurid poses on Youtube from underneath her hijab, which “Cuties” plays for a laugh.  Everything Doucouré’s script seeds goes wrong all at once, the heaviest aspects of the drama not being dispersed throughout the film at regular intervals, and it doesn’t go anywhere unexpected, only exactly where you feared it might. Watching these girls increasingly inappropriate (and bullying) behavior simply grows more upsetting, until it gets to the point where you want to rewind the movie, have a talk with Amy, and stop her from ever stealing that phone in the first place."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive," When we speak in platitudes about the hardships and the bullying faced by tween-aged kids in school, we might speak about encouraging self-confidence or goal achievement. But, in Maïmouna Doucouré’s sharply observed Cuties, about an eleven-year-old girl steering full bore into a new version of herself—a version apart from the idea of womanhood offered by her family—we are reminded that kids’ goals are often not in their own best interest. The bullies are mean but the bullied would give anything to become them, the most potent example of power and outward confidence they have to look up to. Still, Cuties reminds us, this misguided ambition is difficult—and potentially damaging—to try and discourage. It’s Amy’s (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi) first day at her new Parisian elementary school when she encounters the Mignonnes, or Cuties, a quartet of outgoing popular girls who have started their own dance troupe with the aim of taking on an older, Instagram-famous team of dancers. The Cuties’ brand of budding femininity is instantly more appealing to Amy than the life planned for her by her Senegalese family and community where “learning to be a woman” involves preparing the meal for her father’s upcoming wedding to his second wife (polygamy, not divorce), the news of which has made Amy feel even more disconnected from her home life. Cuties‘ most outrageous but most indispensable element is the highly sexualized behavior of its core cast of children. At first, all the pouts and gyrations and bare midriffs seem like pure comedy. But, even though it continues to be funny, the humor gains a darker edge as we come to understand how this particular brand of precociousness represents a dual-edged freedom. The girls’ move toward more assured self-expression is a positive but one worries about the healthiness of understanding sexiness before understanding sex.  Doucouré is as ambivalent about her character’s maturation as she is about their friendship. When Amy and head Mignonne Angelica (Medina El Aidi) lounge in bed, talking about their families, their bond is so tight that they’re even twirling their hair together. Female friendships of any age tend to be stronger and more intimate than those of boys and men but, at an age when insecurity is at its max, the slightest betrayal or rough patch can tear these girls apart devastatingly. In its nonjudgmental empathy and its comedy of discomfort, Cuties is a tad reminiscent of Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade, though with an even younger lead. But Doucouré distinguishes her film with touches of magical realism–a dress that seems to change and swell in anticipation of Amy’s puberty; possibly sentient confetti; an airborne game of jump rope–that make Cuties thrillingly unique. That is exactly why it is a “thing”. Our so called betters are pushing the  sexualization of children as “normal” because of the very large number of pedos among the so called Elite. By the time people who have been asleep to such things wake up to this, these elites & 80% of Hollywood as well hope to have desensitized Americans to pedophilia to such an extent regular folks wont be revolted to much and call for all of their scalps.. I don’t think it has been the elites who watched cable TV shows such as DANCE MOMS, with 10 to 12 year old girls in skimpy outfits performing risque dance routines week after week.  Or the 12 to 14 year old girls paraded on stage by their own mothers on the MURRAY POVICH SHOW on network TV in the morning hours. They would be attired in the scantiest of outfits, and then  queried about their sexual activity while Mr. Povich, their moms, and the audience feigned shock and outrage. Go and watch the Jr. high  cheerleaders at many high schools, especially in Texas, Florida, and California, if you want to see tiny outfits and sexualized dance routines. There is a major problem alright, but it is widespread and right in your own backyard."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive," French writer/director Maïmouna Doucouré strikes a mostly affable balance between familiar coming-of-age tropes and culturally specific intersections with her debut Cuties. A striking portrait of contemporary adolescence filmed in Paris, the film’s focus is an awkward transition for its lead protagonist, a second-generation Senegalese girl increasingly estranged from her family’s culture whilst embracing all the toxic rites of passage of modern teen angst. Doucouré’s 2015 short “Maman(s)” navigated similar autobiographical territory from a culture which allows for polygamy on the husband’s side, and it’s one of several eye-opening realities which assist in triggering the escapist slanted teen rebellion here. Throw into the mix the usual hypersexualization of young girls and the obliviousness of the adults guiding them and Doucouré portrays a perfect tempest faced by young women in the crafting of their personas defined by a swift loss of innocence and the oft-impossible feat of discovering what one really desires. Eleven-year-old Amy (Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi) finds herself in a suddenly tenuous position. At home, her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) is in anguish, and Amy accidentally learns her father, who has been away from the family on a trip to Senegal, has taken a second wife, who he has married and will be bringing home to join their household. While Mariam is preoccupied with her own emotional turmoil, Amy strikes a friendship with the rebellious Angelique, her neighbor in the same apartment complex who is the unofficial head of a dance troupe who call themselves ‘the cuties’ and rehearse for a potential dance competition with the hope to out-twerk an older, rival gang of girl dancers. Angelique’s cohorts initially reject Amy, but eventually she wheedles her way into their graces following the tumultuous and unexpected expulsion of one of their posse, a young girl who unwittingly angers Angelique. It’s not long before Amy has enhanced the troop’s sultriness by introducing more titillating dance moves she’s gleaned from music videos. But the shifting stability at home and the mercurial Angelique force Amy to the point of desperation. Doucouré (who penned the script) crafted her story with director Alice Winocour (Disorder, 2015; Proxima, 2019), Valentine Milville and Nathalie Surgeon (My Revolution, 2016), and Cuties does feel as if it’s a spiritual cousin to something like 2016’s Mustang, which Winocour wrote, another narrative focused on archaic cultural traditions which repress women and prove to be detrimental in the development of their young, contemporary female characters. Narratives revolving around the arrival of a second wife are rife for contemporary dramatic possibilities but are usually from the perspective of the first wife, such as Kuma (2012) by Umat Dag and Brillante Mendoza’s Thy Womb (2012), so it’s a unique perspective to use it as the foreground for a child simultaneously attempting to assimilate into the culture of another country. To a significant degree, much of Cuties feels familiar, specifically a troubled journey we can predict for Amy with the dance competition. But Doucouré focuses so tightly on the perspective of Amy, whose adolescent behaviors are wholly familiar, she concocts a compelling slippery slope of how quickly angst mutates into dysfunction and eventually to points of no return. For instance, Cuties is not meant to examine how young women are influenced to seek their worth through desirability, and we’re never privy to how the adults in their realm feel about their troubling, sexually charged dancing, sans some concerned parents in the dance competition audience or Amy’s relatives announcing she’s dressed like a ‘whore.’ Social media plays into Amy’s new conception of herself, though access to the platform is tenuous, as her avatar depends on holding onto a stolen phone from a relative. The cultural intersections of Cuties are, in essence, barely touched upon, and yet there’s a richness to Doucouré’s coming-of-age narrative which eludes many of her contemporary counterparts. As Amy, Abdillahi is a graceful, mournful screen presence despite the awkwardness of the age in question, and as she begins to embrace her newfound confidence, she is reminiscent of a leggy, teen version of American singer Ciara. Despite the connections made or lost with various characters, and a commitment to sincerity which sometimes lends itself to grating moments (most often when Amy and her new friends are goofing around and acting their age in public), Amy is an insulated character and Doucouré wisely depends on the performance of Abidllahi to convey the roiling emotions which can’t be fashioned into words. Reuniting with her “Maman(s)” cinematographer Yann Maritaud, clothing becomes a major focus of Cuties to convey how wardrobe choices represent cultural markers and meanings, finishing on a note of perfection when Amy decides upon an ensemble and activities befitting herself and her age—concluding with a note of magical metaphor recalling the final moments of Maren Ade’s debut The Forest for the Trees (2003).

"Jan 24, 2020",positive," The desire to rebel is a natural instinct for many children. To be told what not to do tends to fuel an inherent urge to push back against authority. Set in France, Maïmouna Doucouré’s Cuties demonstrates the universality of these themes, transcending language and culture. Amy (Fathia Youssouf) is a fairly rebellious eleven-year-old, discontent with the strict rules in her household. The circumstances make it hard to blame her. Her mother Miriam (Maïmouna Gueye) is a hard-working parent struggling to raise three children while her husband pursues a second marriage in Senegal. Miriam is a compassionate woman who played by the rules of tradition, with seemingly little to show for it. A group of girls who dub themselves the “cuties” attract Amy’s interest with their elaborate dance routines. Eager to join their clique, Amy starts to deviate from the guidelines set before her. A stolen cellphone provides Amy with valuable cultural capital, as well as a glimpse of the broader world she’d been sheltered from. Doucouré is quite skilled at conveying emotion, capturing the highs and lows of adolescence in a way that speaks to the universality of growing up. Cuties is often hilarious. The young talent are superb at drawing laughs from subtle moments that are easy to relate to. Though many have not had to experience the idea of having a second wife move into one’s already-cramped apartment, Cuties touches on themes that are quite popular in American cinema. Amy’s father is not shown to be a great guy, and the adults in her life struggle to help Amy copes with this harsh reality. Earlier eras put up with that stuff in a way that simply isn’t appealing to a younger demographic that’s experienced a world outside the strict confines of religion. Which isn’t to say that Amy is some misunderstood angel. Like many eleven-year-olds, she’s prone to behaving like a brat. Doucouré captures this trajectory in a powerful way largely through Amy’s relationship with her mother. American family sitcoms are filled with predictable teaching moments at the end of their episodes. Cuties follows similar arcs, but shakes things up in a refreshing manner, dealing with reality rather than a “mom knows best” outcome. Cuties captures adolescence life in a deeply moving manner. The film is very well-crafted with a keen sense of pacing, packing quite a lot into a ninety-minute runtime. Doucouré fully understands what it’s like to be a kid and an adult, delivering a compassionate family narrative that respects both sides of the equation. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "
"Jan 24, 2020",negative," A preteen steps away from her traditional Senegalese family background and attempts to fit in by joining a posse of precociously sexualized dancers in Maïmouna Doucouré's feature debut, 'Cuties.' The awkward transition from childhood into sexually self-aware adolescence is navigated at reckless speed by the young protagonist of Cuties. Writer-director Maïmouna Doucouré’s captivating but structurally shaky first feature is stronger on setup than development or payoff, becoming less controlled as its opposing forces of tradition and rebellion collide. But as 11-year-old Amy, Fathia Youssouf provides a disarmingly tender center to this drama about the child of a Senegalese family anxious to escape troubles at home and find peer acceptance by joining a mean-girl dance clique at her French middle school. Following its Sundance premiere, the French production will be released in spring by Netflix, where it might benefit from proximity to Mati Diop’s beguiling fusion of social realism with the supernatural, Atlantics. However, the film Cuties most recalls is American director Anna Rose Holmer’s The Fits, which told a similar, though far more abstract story of a tween girl awakening into young womanhood via the alluring power of physical movement. Amy has just moved with her mother, Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye), and two younger brothers into a new apartment; her questions about when their father will return to them from Senegal receive only vague answers. She gradually learns, however, that he will be bringing a second wife to occupy the lavishly appointed master bedroom kept under lock and key. Pressured by the family’s old-school Aunty (Mbissine Thérèse Diop), Mariam has agreed to share their home and celebrate the wedding, putting on a brave face while literally beating herself up for a marital demotion she sees as her own personal failing. Her mother’s desolation — at odds with the teachings of Muslim community prayer meetings where wives vow to obey their husbands — does nothing to help Amy map her own path to womanhood. Instead, she’s mesmerized as she watches her spirited neighbor Angelica (Médina El Aidi-Azouni) dancing with sultry self-possession in the building’s laundry, dressed in a skimpy crop top and skintight leatherette pants. Amy is drawn to Angelica and her posse of fellow dance enthusiasts from school, Coumba (Esther Gohourou), Jess (Ilanah Cami-Goursolas) and Yasmine (Myriam Hamma), collectively known as “The Cuties.” The outsider is visibly delighted by their exuberant fashion sense, sassy attitudes and dynamic moves. At first, they treat her with bullying scorn, but Amy won’t be deterred, gaining tentative admission to their circle through Angelica. In the meantime, she steals the cell phone of her cousin (Mamadou Samake) and gets an addictive first taste of social media and YouTube, studying videos of older women’s provocative twerking moves and then practicing her own version of them alone in the bathroom. When an altercation leads to Yasmine being shut out of the group, Amy is ready to step in, spicing up their routine as they prepare for tryouts in a local dance contest. Doucouré establishes intriguing juxtapositions as she deftly sets the wheels of inevitable conflict in motion. The brightly colored but matronly gown sent from Senegal for Amy to wear to her father’s second wedding stands as a rebuke to her as she amusingly repurposes her kid brother’s undersized T-shirt as a crop top and trades her soccer-mom jeans for cutoffs. There’s also real poignancy in Mariam’s sorrow that plays in counterpoint to Amy’s secret emancipation. But as Amy gets closer to the dance contest, falling in and out of favor with the other girls, the storytelling becomes less fluid. Even the frequent shots of energy injected via dance montages start to feel like padding as the plot momentum falters. The director is working mostly in a naturalistic vein and her occasional stylistic flourishes of magic realism don’t always feel organic. The bigger issue is that once the film establishes its critical view of a culture that steers impressionable young girls toward the hypersexualization of their bodies, it sets up a clash against traditional values that should provide a sturdy third act — particularly given the rich contextual potential to explore African identity in a Western European country. The elements are put in place, from Amy’s defiance, dishonesty and ruthless determination to participate in the contest at any price, to Aunty’s glowering condemnation and Mariam’s emotional crossroads as the wedding approaches. But Doucouré doesn’t quite thread those strands into a satisfying conclusion. There nonetheless are plenty of reasons to keep watching, from the vibrancy of the visuals to the youthful vitality of the preteen actors and the feverish excitability with which the movie captures young female friendship. There’s especially engaging work from the magnetic Youssouf as Amy and from El Aidi-Azouni, who gives bespectacled Angelica a spiky authority softened by an occasional touch of sweetness. But although the closing shots of Amy in more modest Western clothing jumping rope with other girls from her father’s wedding party are lovely, they largely bypass the real drama and go directly to an unearned and disappointingly facile image of empowered resilience."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive," For her feature debut, writer/director Maimouna Doucoure (the Sundance-winning short Maman(s)) sets the sexual awakening and desperate need for acceptance of an 11 year-old girl against a clash of cultures in the internet age. The sight of twerking pre-teen bodies is explicitly designed to shock mature audiences into a contemplation of today’s destruction of innocence, but some missteps hold Cuties at a distance for that demographic: a film to respect for its audacity, admire for its lead female performance perhaps, but also view as a dramatically contrived. Premiering at Sundance after which it travels to Berlin’s Generation section in advance of a French theatrical release and Netflix global outing, Cuties will certainly garner mainstream media attention, but it’s the streaming service, and its giant young audience, which should propel Doucoure’s debut into the YA hit zone of 13 Reasons Why or The End of the F***ing World. Underscoring that this is her target audience, Doucoure moves the film along furiously and brightly, painting the scenario in broad, teen-friendly, neon-accented brushstrokes. It’s also scored with an eye to the zeitgeist – heavy on Ygress, and with tracks including ‘My Bitches Are Comin’. Adult supervision is conveniently negligible at home or at school; this is a film for and about kids, and Senegalese immigrant Amy (or Aminata), played impressively by Fathia Youssouf Abdillahi throughout, is chief amongst them. Amy’s home life is troubled: her family is deeply religious and she is consistently admonished to be pious and cover her head when outside the family’s new home, which is a giant public housing block in Paris mostly inhabited by her fellow countrymen. She awaits the return of her father from Senegal but, when he does come back, it will be with his new second wife – a fact which Amy’s depressed and mostly-absent mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) initially hides. Amy must go to school while looking after her two younger brothers (which she often does by locking one in the bathroom). There, she is drawn to a bitchy girl gang who have a dance group called The Cuties. And, as it turns out, she will stop at nothing to gain their acceptance. Doucoure’s screenplay requires Amy’s behaviour to escalate radically (and often hysterically) in the absence of any real-world consequence. She steals a phone from a family friend and money from her distracted mother; her brother floods the bathroom; she goes to school wearing a tank top and PVC trousers and has screeching fights with rival gangs. Yet nobody in this close-knit community raises an alarm. In short, she’s acting out in some style, and pretty soon she wins a place in the Cuties troop despite her “flat ass”. We then move to outrageous musical montages involving close-up crotch shots of pouting pre-teens. Doucoure seems to want to provoke censure, but fails precisely because she’s trying so hard. Ultimately, that’s the fate that also befalls Amy as she learns the perils of the internet and the limits of the selfie. All four Cuties members give excellent performances, both in their routines and as convincing members of a fairly oppressive demographic – the pre-teen girl gang. It’s Abdillahi who is outstanding, however, moving between child and young adult with an ease that mirrors the real-life confusion of that age. Doucoure captures her, and pre-adolescence, at a moment in time which young audiences will recognise and respond to. Most viewers – and parents in particular – will find some truth in at least parts of Cuties. Ultimately, though, Doucoure has chosen her own girl gang, and they’re the ones who will most benefit from this cautionary tale when it moves to streaming.

Eleven-year-old Amy (a revelatory Fathia Youssouf Abdillah) already has an eye for petty misdeeds before falling in with the titular “cuties” of Maimouna Doucouré’s feature debut. The sweet, gangly tween is no stranger to tiny acts of rebellion that both mystify and thrill her, as if even she can’t believe what she’s getting up to in the liminal space between childhood and adulthood. Sticky-fingered (a set of prayer beads here, a much-needed cell phone there) and hyper-observant, Amy doesn’t miss a trick, characteristics that not only set her apart from her family but also make her something of a curiosity at her local school. Recently moved into a bustling French apartment building and a dizzyingly busy middle school, Amy is in state of massive transition, and that’s before the physical demands of puberty start to infiltrate every inch of her body and mind. Doucouré’s even-handed approach to the film’s grounded first half is what makes it so moving and relatable, and despite the specificity of Amy’s story — her family, culture, background, and the contemporary obsessions that enthrall her — there is a heartening universality to her troubles. “Cuties” may have plenty on its mind, but it’s also the kind of coming-of-age story that will make any adult viewer think back to their own tween years. You couldn’t pay most people to re-live all that; watching Amy endure it on screen is hard enough. (Despite the drama of her storyline, Doucouré has a real eye for visual humor: Amy sitting quietly during a prayer service, tucked inside her headscarves as she watches a twerking video while appearing to pray, and a sight gag centered on the outrageous number of onions she’s tasked with chopping in preparation for a feast.) Originally from Senegal, Amy’s traditional lifestyle requires that she honor her parents — and eventually, her husband — by being meek and reserved, faithful and timid. And yet Amy’s familial unit has already started to break down, propelling them into uncharted space. In the absence of her father (resolved in the film’s first act through one hell of a heartbreaking revelation), Amy must honor her mother (a haunting Maïmouna Gueye) above all. Once that part of her life changes, the diversions pile up. There’s her growing femininity, her needy younger brother, and a new interest in pop music and dancing. And there, of course, are the Cuties. The Cuties are a budding dance crew whose leader happens to live in Amy’s building. The intrigue is understandable: Where Amy is shy, they are bold, where she is modest, they’re brash. Doucouré and her young cast believably chart the girls’ fickle affections as Amy orbits their world, from their intense adoration to their terrible ability to bully each other. Amy eventually wiggles her way into the group by way of her stolen cell phone, offering her services as a videographer for their dancing exploits. The girls are preparing to enter a dance contest, and an appearance by their great rivals (the Sweety-Swaggs) lays out what’s the come: The Swaggs are older, more developed, more sexualized, and their moves reflect that. The Cuties certainly don’t understand that even the elder Swaggs are at the mercy of a hyper-sexualized culture and its demands, and that there’s something deeply wrong with a teenager taking her top off in the middle of dance video. Soon enough, the Cuties are unfurling their own new routine led by Amy, who remains tuned in to what’s happening around her but not what it actually means. The foursome does realize that there is something here beyond their reach — new best pal Angelica balks at a move that involves lasciviously sucking on her fingers and they all seem to think their butt-bumping is silly more than anything. The audience must endure their sexualization as increasingly horrified spectators. The girls vacillate between being hyper-interested in the opposite sex (the girls push Amy to videotape a cute boy in the bathroom) and being freaked out by its actual mechanics, as in a scene in which they discover a used condom. A group of initially interested teenage boys soon recoil in disgust (and fear?) when they realize how young the Cuties are. “They’re little girls,” one of them scoffs, as the tweens jostle and preen, desperate to prove otherwise. As Amy more fully enters the world of womanhood, “Cuties” takes on a more mystical aspect, one that’s not always earned and never fits inside the very real space Doucouré carved out for her characters. It’s an uneasy merging of the grounded and the out-there that’s never fully realized and always distracting. (That Doucouré ends her film with a one-two punch of too-obvious symbolism and the film’s most fantastic sequence is, without spoiling the details, a tremendous letdown.) The eventual consequences Amy must face are believable, built around a coming-of-age trope of suddenly being forced to reckon with her two lives on the same day. However, Doucouré muddies them with magical realism that does little to advance the storyline or Amy’s evolving character. Although Doucouré steeps “Cuties” in emotion and experience, she abandons its grace to make crazier gestures. “Cuties” doesn’t need sudden splotches of blood or a twist that turns Amy into, at best, a young criminal. Growing up is hard enough, and “Cuties” knows that — until it doesn’t. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Jan 24, 2020",negative," Eleven-year-old Senegalese immigrant Amy (Fathia Youssouf) reckons there are two ways to be a woman. Amy could mimic her mom (Maïmouna Gueye), a dutiful drudge with three kids and a husband who’s just announced he’s bringing home a second wife. Or she could copy the “Cuties,” a quartet of brazen girls who wear tube tops to class, screech “Freedom!” in the hallways, and rehearse their dance crew after school. Either way, the new-in-town 6th grader is ready to select a lane and speed toward maturity. To writer-director Maïmouna Doucouré, the choice is simple. Her coming-of-age drama starts with Amy doodling stick figures and climaxes with the kid booty-shaking in hot pants. The choice is also false, but Doucouré believes that today’s girls see their options in black and white. “Cuties'” job is to coil the contrasting messages and spin them until her lead falls down dizzy, which can make the film feel as subtle as a headache. (Two paragraphs into this review, and you, dear reader, can guess that the big wedding and the big dance competition happen on the same day!) “Cuties” is an extension of Doucouré’s 2016 César- and Sundance-winning short “Maman(s)”, about an 8-year-old child furious when her polygamous dad invites his new bride into their Parisian apartment. (The two movies share the same powerful shot of the mother weeping when she thinks she’s alone, not realizing her daughter is hidden under the bed and staring at her ankles.) The betrayal — a word Amy and her mother never use, but the emotion Doucouré clearly feels — happened to Doucouré herself, she’s still tapped into her youthful resentment, shame and proto-feminist fury. Amy never explains the root of why she’s acting out, not even when her domineering Aunty attempts to disinfect her soul with a Muslim spiritual ritual. But Doucouré remembers. Aging her lead character three years allows the first-time feature director to explore the contradictions of being 11, an age just old enough that you want to be older, yet so young that “older” means pretending to be 14. Amy’s worldly new friends don’t yet know how much they don’t know. Not only does Coumba (Esther Gohourou), the loudest flirt, mistake a condom for a balloon, after she blows it up, the other girls panic that she’s probably going to die. (In the movie’s funniest gag, they frantically scrub Coumba’s mouth with soap.) To be 11 means attempting to simultaneously prove you’re a kid and a grownup, and failing at both. When the gang sneaks into a laser-tag playroom, they try to intimidate the security guard by accusing him of pedophilia, and cap off their attack with the dizzying threat, “We’re children. We’ll call our lawyers!” Ironically, the movie could use more consequences. Amy tiptoes around her home like her Aunty’s temper is made of lava. Yet, when she screws up, say, by letting Angelica, the Cuties’ ringleader, kick open her second mother’s bedroom door and jump on the tacky rosette blanket, Amy cowers in fear … and nothing bad ever happens. There’s a few too many fake-outs to invest in the film’s stakes, even as Amy’s antics get increasingly egregious. The problem might be that Doucouré is too aware that an 11-year-old has no sense of perspective. A bungled video chat with a cute boy is given more emotional weight than near-manslaughter. Still, Amy’s most corrosive influence isn’t Angelica, who irons her hair in the laundry room and rules over the girls with a glittered fist. It’s a smartphone Amy steals that allows her to watch stripper videos underneath her headscarf during afternoon prayers. She’s too naive to know that slapping asses isn’t just adult, it’s Adult. Later, she poaches the moves for the Cuties’ big show, setting up a performance that outdoes “Little Miss Sunshine” in sexualized, awkward audacity. (Doucouré would rather get gasps than laughs.) Newcomer Youssouf has an anchoring presence. Occasionally, Doucouré lets her light up the screen with a smile, and at the director’s most expressionistic, the girl floats. Yann Maritaud’s cinematography is rich with jewel tones, especially in a blue and red beaded dress made for Amy to wear to her father’s wedding. In “Cuties'” most poetic shot, a gust of wind blows into the closet and the gown’s chest heaves as though it’s been aching for an obedient little girl to give it life. It’s in those moments that Doucouré offers a glimpse of the director she might become when she trusts audiences to understand her themes without heavy underlining. Till then, the image that lingers is Amy gyrating as her Aunty exorcises her with splashes of cold water. The flailing girl looks like she’s suffering — and she also looks like she’s twerking. She’s acting the sinner, and she’s practicing her sin. Her two frauds have converged."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive," A perfect illustration of growing up today, French director Maïmouna Doucouré’s spirited debut “Cuties” assesses the transition from childhood to adolescence by pointing its lens at an 11-year-old girl at the crossroads of tradition and personal discovery. It’s the type of first feature that heralds an indelible directorial voice. Echoes of Céline Sciamma’s “Girlhood,” Mati Diop’s “Atlantics,” or Nijla Mumin’s “Jinn” are strident, but the age gap separating the teens in those efforts and the young lead here strongly distinguishes this new film from its forebears. Although not breaking untraveled ground, “Cuties” is a necessary new entry among these idiosyncratic narratives centered on black girlhood going against the grain of the status quo, and no less noteworthy for that. Exposed to loads of instantly reachable information, both detrimental and advantageous, kids raised on online gratification inevitably mature at a faster rate, or so at first glance seems to be the case of Aminata Diop (Fathia Youssouf) — Amy for short — the daughter of Senegalese immigrants in the marginalized suburbs of modern-day Paris. Her traditional Muslim upbringing imposes gender-based restrictions, which Amy begins to reject when the allure of rebelliousness and camaraderie presents itself in the form of four ethnically diverse schoolmates who call themselves “Cuties” and are also a competitive dance crew. Maïmouna emboldens these tweens with a rowdiness and even raunchiness that has too often been reserved for boys on screen. There’s a refreshing impetus to not only their choreography but also their authority-defying attitude, and Amy, accustomed to strict boundaries, becomes obsessively enthralled to get a taste of that unknown freedom. In Angelica (a vivacious Médina El Aidi-Azouni), the daughter of Latin American immigrants — at this tender age, she has already internalized that she’s failed to satisfy her parents’ expectations — Amy finds her closest friend and an entry point into the Cuties. At that age, one can’t fathom parting with the valuable lifeline of a contemporary’s validation of one’s personality, but in Amy’s case, her search for acceptance comes in reaction to the powerlessness to which she’s witnessed her mother Mariam (Maïmouna Gueye) be subjected. As their belief system permits, her father has taken a second wife, leaving her mother to save face and partake in the wedding preparations while drowning in humiliation and hurt. To manifest Amy’s understanding of womanhood in the context of her family’s background, Maïmouna employs heart-rending poignancy and nuanced humor. A tragically beautiful early scene sees Amy hiding under a bed hearing her mother wail and sharing in her pain, and a later one, dealing with insecurity about her appearance, shows her observing women’s voluptuous bodies — comparing herself, but also reassured that maybe she will one day look like them. Other beats, like her first period, are expected but irreproachably honest. Bombarded with hyper-sexualized imagery in audiovisual content, Amy envisions a dance routine, featuring grinding and twerking, that’s sure to be deemed inappropriate but that, in her mind, will put to rest the notion that she and her friends are children. Such desire to attain the agency that comes with adulthood is not new, but it has inevitably been precipitated more dangerously because of the internet. No other sub-genre has been more wildly revolutionized through the proliferation of social media, and the digital alter egos we’ve all built for ourselves, than the coming-of-age film. Cellphone access, the director knows, has forever transformed human development and milestones, which no longer transpire as they did just a few years ago. Amy longs to be liked and is unfortunately aware of how visual objectification generates popularity. Maïmouna’s confident writing and directing straddle that delicate subject and ensure that cinematographer Yann Maritaud never shoots the Cuties’ presentations or self-recorded videos with anything resembling seduction, instead highlighting the girls’ learned exaggeration and their juvenile understanding of what being sexy should look like. Playfulness and saturated colors defuse the provocative pop songs, without judging Amy and her girlfriends for being influenced by the digitally-driven world into which they were born. Youssouf gives a high-voltage performance bursting with quiet angst and volatile dynamism. Throughout Amy’s desperate plight to fit in and to disconnect from what’s occurring at home, Maïmouna refrains from having the character verbally explode; instead her physicality and concrete actions relay her internal unrest, similar to what Royalty Hightower does in Anna Rose Holmer’s “The Fits.” No facile moralist choices are made in “Cuties,” as Amy’s risky choices range from theft to considering letting someone die to stay cool. There’s great merit in Maïmouna’s command of a tonally treacherous story and a principal cast of mostly first-timers playing true to life Gen Z girls with complexity not suitable for their counterparts on the Disney Channel. Bolstered by an infectiously reckless joie de vivre and artfully handled hard-hitting truths, “Cuties” diffuses the impulse to dismiss it as just one more example of a trend. Its final shot is a cinematic chef’s kiss that wraps Amy’s innocence in a safe embrace, letting us know that, thankfully, her ability for wonderment hasn’t been entirely destroyed."
